2
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:39,667
Shiva!

3
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,625
Ey...Shiva!

4
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:46,750
Shiva.

5
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:47,917
Oh my God!

6
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:51,917
Shiva!

7
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,292
4 Youngsters who were
on a trek this evening,

8
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,625
were caught in a fire accident.

9
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:09,125
From which 3 are
suspected to be dead---

10
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,333
---along which Shiva,
a football player

11
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,875
has been admitted at the
hospital due to severe injury.

12
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,625
Pertaining to it, the
Forest Ranger---

13
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,958
---is inquiring to find out if
the fire occurred naturally

14
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,833
or it's a work of
anti-social elements.

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,958
Please sit down.

16
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,333
I'm so sorry.

17
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,917
You son's face have been severely
damaged due to the fire.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,583
Usually patients
with 20-30% burn

19
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:44,458
we can graft using the skin
from their thighs or back.

20
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:48,875
But your son's face
has 90% burns.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,792
Savithri!

22
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,292
Savithri.

23
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,292
-If so,
-Nothing would've happened

24
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,250
will he remain like
this his whole life.

25
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,208
Ma'am please calm down.

26
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,000
Be brave!

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,792
You please relax for a moment.

28
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:01,792
Don't be scared.

29
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,917
There's nothing to be worried.

30
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,625
There's another option
for such critical cases.

31
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,708
Face Transplant.

32
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:13,875
What is that Doctor?

33
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,583
Let me explain.

34
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:22,292
Look at him.

35
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:24,833
His name is Richard.

36
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,333
Pretty much your son's face---

37
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,792
---is damaged to this extent.

38
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,125
If you look at him, he's
a critical patient.

39
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,667
so, when he was on his death bed

40
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,750
his face was used for
Richard's transplant.

41
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,667
Eye donation, heart donation---

42
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:44,750
---kidney donation

43
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,792
just like that, we need a
donor for this as well.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,667
I know a patient,

45
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:56,042
he was admitted 6 months ago
suffering from an accident.

46
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:59,958
And lately his pulse
is coming down.

47
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,000
He is at present Brain Dead.

48
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,292
chances of survival
are very less.

49
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,875
If his blood relation
agree to donate,

50
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,333
this transplant could happen.

51
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:39,833
We can perform a surgery.

52
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,750
And one more important thing

53
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,833
when this treatment is
going, make sure your son

54
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:49,333
doesn't look into mirror

55
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:53,333
or any reflective objects,
will be better for him.

56
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,792
He'll be heartbroken.

57
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,583
Ahhh...Ah!

58
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:33,875
Oh no!

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,542
Your son is brain dead now.

60
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,750
The heart is slowly giving away.

61
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,000
Can't really say, how
long he'll be alive.

62
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,833
I shouldn't be
bringing this up now,

63
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,583
But I don't have an option

64
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,000
If you agree to it,

65
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,125
you can donate organs.

66
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,375
Madam...Madam!

67
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,417
If you help us with this---

68
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:18,083
---your son

69
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,958
will continue to live
even after his death.

70
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:24,125
Please Madam!

71
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,292
Please Madam!

72
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,208
Please Madam.

73
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,167
For God sake, please
do this favour for us.

Thanks a lot Doctor.

97
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,958
In the case of patients
with 20-30% burns,

98
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,167
we could ideally take the
skin from the patient's

99
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,833
back or thigh for the graft.

100
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:07,333
Right!?

101
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,625
But in the case of Mr.Shiva---

102
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:09,167
Booo!

103
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,042
Get in...

104
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,667
Get inside Son...

105
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:33,583
Good morning Ma!

106
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:35,792
Did you just wake up?

107
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,833
Mmmm!...Why do you
have a picture of me?

108
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:39,000
Listen---

109
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,167
---when you're home

110
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:44,083
feels like some stranger
is in the house.

111
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,750
That's the reason, I'm
getting your face imprinted

112
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:49,250
Why do you need a
picture for that?

113
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:50,792
Look closely---

114
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,333
---this is my new face.

115
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,208
Look!...Look!...Looook!

116
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:54,667
Get lost!

117
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:02,042
Brother, can you please drop
me at college, just today.

118
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,208
What's this new habit? When
have I ever dropped you?

119
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,292
Until yesterday, you were
an average looking guy.

120
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,375
But now, you've turned
into an handsome hunk.

121
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,333
Thought of introducing
you to my friends.

122
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,958
-Ok fine, I'll drop you
-Ey...!

123
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:16,917
Ah...Ah! come on
stop the vehicle.

124
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:17,875
Pull over.

125
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:19,667
Take out your driving license.

126
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,417
Get it insured, come on next.

127
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,708
Don't worry, just a minute.

128
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:25,875
Here take this Sir.

129
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,917
Hey! are you kidding with me?

130
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,250
Give me your driving license.

131
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:32,542
That's my license, Sir.

132
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,833
Is that yours?

133
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:37,000
The picture on this is
different from what you look?

134
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,333
A face transplant was done,
'cause I was in an accident.

135
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,667
they've done a re-construction surgery
of the face with skin grafting

136
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,292
my jaw line has also been
completely replaced, Sir.

137
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,500
Since they did it by
Flap Surgery & Suture---

138
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:49,958
---I don't understand
what you're saying.

139
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,208
Give me 50 bucks.

140
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:51,792
Huh!?

141
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,792
If you have 50 bucks,
just pay up and leave.

142
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,667
-Listen
-Huh!?

143
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,458
Wasn't it Shanthi, who was acting
as daughter-in-law until yesterday?

144
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:01,917
Ya.

145
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:03,708
How come there's another actress
as daughter-in-law today?

146
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,417
How can we agree to it?

147
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,375
Can't agree, it's
totally unfair.

148
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:10,292
Why, until last week you saw
your son as someone else.

149
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,792
now you see him in a
different avatar.

150
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,125
Just like that.

151
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,500
You have to adapt.

152
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,500
You're right Dad.

153
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:16,958
Hey!

154
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,375
Dad, change the channel.

155
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,000
Aren't you home just jobless!?

156
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,958
Can't you at least
change these batteries?

157
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:27,000
Hello!

158
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,458
Hey, where are you?

159
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:29,500
Hey, who is this?

160
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,208
It's me Shiva.

161
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,375
Oh Mirchi Shiva!

162
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,167
Brother, I watched
Tamizh Padam 2

163
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,708
your performance was
extraordinary.

164
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,792
Moreover, the guy who played
the part of a villain,

165
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,333
whatta performance!

166
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:40,542
Just one regret,

167
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,500
that he lost to you in
a dance competition.

168
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:43,583
That was not convincing.

169
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,625
Hey idiot, it's me
your friend Shiva.

170
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,583
Oh it's you, tell me
how are you buddy.

171
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,667
You were missing for a month, and
your phone was switched off.

172
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:53,208
That's right buddy, I'm
not jobless as you.

173
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,667
I was in Dubai last month.

174
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,250
I just got back to Chennai, will
be leaving to Bangkok tonight.

175
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,167
Ok fine, where are you now?
Come home.

176
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,417
Home!? which one?

177
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,917
The one surrounded by sludge,

178
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:03,292
a water tanker
parked on the road

179
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:05,250
also two buffaloes guarding it
all the time, is that the one?

180
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,542
I can't come over,

181
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:07,625
speak to me over the phone.

182
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,000
Are you free now?

183
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,958
Tell me where are you?
I'll come there myself.

184
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,333
Free and me!?

185
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,667
9-10, warm up with
my girlfriend.

186
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,333
10-12, I have to sell foreign
goods at Burma Bazaar.

187
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,292
1-2, a small break

188
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,333
of course with a chick.

189
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,042
3-4, for these pervert uncles---

190
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,333
---I have to supply
***** **** capsules.

191
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,708
Post which I'll leave
to Bangkok tonight

192
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,958
I wasted 3 minutes of my life

193
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,583
by speaking to you
over the phone.

194
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:30,375
Hang up, damn it.

195
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,167
Hey...Hey!

196
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,667
Brother, is Gopal
showing off too much?

197
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:36,542
I'll take care of him.

198
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,667
Gopal, don't go abroad
leaving me here alone.

199
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:41,833
please take me with you

200
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,167
Why would I take you to Bangkok?

201
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,250
Hold on, someone's at the
door, I'll check who's it.

202
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:50,000
Wonder who is at the door.

203
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,458
Central Bureau of Investigation!

204
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,458
Bureau at Central!?

205
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,000
CBI!

206
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:57,333
CBI officer!

207
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:58,708
Why are you here?

208
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,750
We got information, that you're being
mischievous with a girl in broad daylight,

209
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,292
Sir, it's a TV show.
A TV show.

210
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:05,208
TV Show!?

211
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:06,000
What show?

212
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,000
"Wedding Night at our House"

213
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,417
We will select 16 girls,

214
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,542
I'll hug them all

215
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,292
will select 3 from them
who are best at hugging,

216
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,875
out of which I'll
get married to one.

217
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,208
Are you going to get
married to her?

218
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:21,250
No Sir. If I get married to her,
the other two will be hurt.

219
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:22,667
in order not to spoil
their friendship

220
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,958
I won't get married to here.

221
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,333
Don't keep staring, I can't marry you.
Get lost.

222
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:26,958
Get lost...!

223
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:27,917
Please leave.

224
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,292
Hey, who are you trying to cheat?

225
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:31,167
Cheat!?

226
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,083
You're under arrest!

227
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,375
Hello Sir! I'm from
a respected family.

228
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,167
You really!?

229
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:36,625
I'm well aware of your respect.

230
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,250
What do you know?

231
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:38,792
9-10, meeting with the girls.

232
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:40,792
10-12, selling foreign
goods at Burma Bazaar.

233
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,583
12-1, exchange currencies.

234
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,792
1-2, chilling with the chicks.

235
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:46,750
3-4, supplying energy
capsules to the old guys.

236
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:49,042
Then finally at 6 leave
to Bangkok on a flight.

237
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:49,917
Isn't this your plan?

238
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:52,000
Sir, you're a great
CBI officer---

239
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,625
---you have accurate
information on me.

240
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Look there a white crow!

241
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,750
White Crow!?

242
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,000
Nirmala Devi is out there---

243
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,750
-Where?
-You guys get distracted by her name

244
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,833
Hey! do they have cameras all
over the house like Bigg Boss?

245
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,083
How did he figure it out?

246
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,000
Buddy, I'm in deep trouble.

247
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,208
CBI seemed to have overheard our
conversation in the morning.

248
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,833
CBI is chasing me, what do I do?

249
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:08,958
Where are you right now?

250
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,250
I'm at the double
tank near KK Nagar.

251
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:12,208
A water tanker just passed by

252
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,625
take a left and proceed
to your right.

253
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,375
right is it!? fine.

254
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,583
Greens...Greens!

255
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,417
Where do I go now?

256
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,375
Where are you now?

257
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,542
A lady who looks like Chris
Gayle is selling greens.

258
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,000
there's an ugly looking
house here too

259
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,833
Get into that house

260
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,083
it's your house damn it.

261
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:26,833
Get inside.

262
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:28,417
I can hear Siren

263
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,417
hope they don't shoot me down.

264
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,833
Buddy, I'm in---

265
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,542
I'm knocking, no one
is answering the door

266
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,958
Don't walk slow like an old
hag, open the door. Quick!

267
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,417
-What is it?
-Open the door, quick!

268
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,208
When my son called
you in the morning,

269
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:42,792
there's sludge around the house

270
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:44,625
street buzzing with water tanker

271
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:45,333
I can't open the door, get lost.

272
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,458
This is not the time to avenge,

273
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,042
CBI is on tail, my life is
in danger, open the door.

274
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:48,958
Fine, come inside.

275
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,583
I'm finally inside the house.

276
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,417
Sir...CBI Sir!

277
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,125
Ey...Ey...Ey...Ey!

278
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,083
-My legs...
-You're faster than a GPS.

279
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,625
If you had show such eagerness,

280
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,125
on the people who swindle
millions and evade

281
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,792
would've been great if
you had caught them.

282
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,125
I just hugged a girl,

283
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,208
I didn't even touch her cheeks.

284
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,625
Why are so eager to catch me?

285
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,000
Hey idiot, It's me.

286
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,750
Who!?

287
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,833
It's my brother, Gopal.

288
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,750
His face was damaged
in a fire accident,

289
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:15,958
I called to let you know that.

290
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,792
Thankfully, we got a donor.

291
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,167
So he has undergone a face
transplant surgery now.

292
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,292
Hey, that's right.
Can't you see?

293
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,292
Oh, is that why it looks a
zipper sewn to your face?

294
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,208
You're growing a
beard to hide that.

295
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:29,333
Still I'm not able
to believe this.

296
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,292
How do I make you believe?

297
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,208
'Buddy come over here...!'

298
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:36,708
Ah...!

299
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,875
'Buy me a Quarter...'

300
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:43,542
'Mutton fry is the thing'

301
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,083
'Chase away the dogs'

302
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,292
-Buddy it's you!
-Come on, Come on.

303
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:55,250
Action!

304
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:58,042
I wish to live along
with you for a century.

305
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,417
Hello, what is this?

306
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:00,667
It's Tamizh, Tamizh!

307
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,458
Oh my God!

308
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,250
You're very beautiful.

309
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,625
I...just a minute

310
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,708
You're very....beautiful!

311
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,958
I wish to live with
you, for a century.

312
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,042
Action!

313
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,917
Pah!...you're very beautiful.

314
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:18,708
I like you very much.

315
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,208
Wish to live with you---

316
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,833
---If so, will live
a century with you.

317
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,750
What kind of guys
have you selected?

318
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,833
If you can't handle
casting, let it go

319
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
-I’ll take care of it.
-What!?

320
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,000
They seem to be good
in front of us.

321
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,750
But they're messing it
up, when they see you.

322
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,250
If you keep rejecting like this,

323
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:38,083
we just 10 days to shoot
and for post production

324
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,542
We're going to be
behind on schedule.

325
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:42,417
So!? Shouldn't it fit
as per the script?

326
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,750
I won't compromise.

327
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:53,917
Guys you're looking for, will
hang out at such hip clubs.

328
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,375
'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star---'

329
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,292
'Try licking the
pickle a bit---'

330
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,167
-Do you want pickle?
-Yes buddy!

331
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,083
Pickle right!?

332
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,625
Hello, do you have pickle?

333
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,708
Sir, we don't serve pickle.

334
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,917
Why do you look at pickle
with such low standards?

335
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:08,958
Are you kidding with me?

336
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,500
We've have paid so much, and
you don't seem to have pickle?

337
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:14,125
Ah!? Tell me why shouldn't
I call him * * * * *?

338
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:15,458
I will call him with that now.

339
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,083
Damn it, a departmental
store has pickle,

340
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,625
but you refuse to serve
pickle in a bar.

341
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,708
Don't piss me off.

342
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,292
Pickle is the staple food of our
country, you got to have it.

343
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,250
This is a conspiracy
by the corporates.

344
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,417
We shouldn't let this go.

345
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,583
-We have to protest.
-This won't work out.

346
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,500
I'm scared looking at the bill,
that's why trying to manage.

347
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:32,833
I don't know what to do?

348
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:35,583
-See if you can find someone.
-I'll try to get some funds.

349
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,833
-How!?
-Just wait!

350
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:39,083
Ey..Ey!

351
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,917
He's charming!

352
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,000
Shall I go and ask him?

353
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,333
Don't ask them now,
they're sloshed

354
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,750
-please...please
-we'll talk to them in the morning

355
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,542
Buddy, take this.

356
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:18,625
I figured, he's here
to pick up chicks.

357
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:19,792
He will pick up,

358
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,292
but for him---

359
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:24,625
That's why, I gave
him a ******.

360
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,708
And that's how I got this money.

361
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,208
Let's go and ask him.

362
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:28,167
-Mmmm-hmmm
-I won't come

363
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,875
Fine, don't get too high.

364
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:31,000
-Let's leave
-Ok bye-bye!

365
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,750
You don't have to
bid him goodbye.

366
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,958
-He's leaving
-We'll take care of it tomorrow

367
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,792
Hey Gigi, I found
your short film lead,

368
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,000
I brought him with me.

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,667
Who!?

370
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:41,667
The guy from the club.

371
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,167
We're meeting him this evening.

372
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:43,917
Really!?

373
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:47,000
Come on, come on!

374
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,750
Defend---defend, go in

375
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:53,833
buddy it's through

376
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:56,125
gain on him, come on get in

377
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,875
Here, pass...pass.

378
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,375
Does your friend work here?

379
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,500
Our job is to prevent
crimes from happening.

380
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:04,792
Oh, are you cops?

381
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:05,542
Nah!

382
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,542
Take it we're working and
getting paid for it,

383
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,708
we keep that money
in our pockets.

384
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:11,667
If some thief picks our pockets,

385
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,250
unfortunately we create
a criminal there.

386
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,167
And if we happen to deposit
the same money in the bank---

387
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,917
---and that money will be
swindled by a businessman.

388
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:20,042
There we create an
international criminal.

389
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,208
Now these things didn't
happen 'cause of us.

390
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:23,083
That's why---

391
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,333
A silly excuse to be jobless.

392
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:29,333
Thanks for not saying
it on my face.

393
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,833
See, I don't blame you

394
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:41,542
You're being honest
that you like me.

395
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,708
I might fall in love with you,
also might get married to you

396
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,375
But in future when we go
out, people will look at us

397
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:50,375
and comment stating, girl is
good looking but the guy isn't.

398
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:52,750
I'll feel bad about it.

399
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,667
So, you don't take me wrong.

400
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,542
I'm taking this
decision for your sake.

401
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:00,458
Buddy!

402
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:02,625
Those girls are making
a short film---

403
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,000
---they want you
to play the lead.

404
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:04,917
Actually, they asked
me to play the part,

405
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:05,708
pass, pass, pass---

406
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:06,958
but it's the role of
a college student.

407
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,625
For that you should
be genuinely young.

408
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,333
There are actors, who play that role even
when they're in their 40's and 50's.

409
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,917
And won't express their
love until the end.

410
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,250
-You must've seen it.
-Hey!

411
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:15,792
Buddy, please come on do it.

412
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:16,708
I can't do it, get lost.

413
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,375
It's not that buddy, the
girl who is with her

414
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,917
she seems to be interested
in me, that's why.

415
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:22,917
So please do it.

416
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:26,833
Oi!

417
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:27,500
Hi!

418
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:28,833
Come over here.

419
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,833
They're packed like
Bigg Boss contestants.

420
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:34,417
Hi!

421
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,250
I heard what you had
asked my friend,

422
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,042
Huh!?

423
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,833
Why do you have to make
films, while studying?

424
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:41,625
Doesn't your family
stop from doing it?

425
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,250
-Pass...pass
-Actually Sir

426
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,792
-we're Vis-Com students
-Can't you see they're talking

427
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,042
We're making this short film for
an International Film Festival.

428
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,333
I don't care what you do

429
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,583
I can't do it, I'm really busy.

430
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:51,417
pass, pass, pass.

431
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:52,750
Please don't say that

432
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,083
We'll fix the shoot
at your convenience.

433
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,208
How about yesterday?

434
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,792
Just for fun, ask them

435
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,500
Please Sir!

436
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:01,250
Go and get the ball

437
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,083
Sir!

438
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,167
Oi!

439
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:04,958
-Did I ask you?
-Mmm-Hmm.

440
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You come and stand here.

441
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,042
You can come over here---

442
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,167
-go and get the ball.
-Smart!

443
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:11,708
Listen---

444
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,125
Ey---what is it?

445
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,792
You're at the peak
of unemployment

446
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:19,792
why have you been acting
smart with that girl?

447
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,000
Can't you just act?

448
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,792
Hey, it's not about that

449
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,083
before my accident

450
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,208
I had mentioned a girl
who rejected my proposal

451
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,958
is it Julie, daughter
of that auto mechanic?

452
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,000
How do you expect me
to keep a count?

453
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:34,833
Until you got this new face,

454
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,375
girls who didn't even
propose have rejected you.

455
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:38,250
Not her---

456
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:42,042
the one which said, she's
doing it for my own good.

457
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,583
This director is the same girl

458
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:44,667
Oh her...

459
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:45,667
Hey!

460
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:49,417
It's fair, if you impress
her with your old face

461
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,167
this is cheating.

462
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:51,792
Did I start this game?

463
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,250
Rejected the face which
she didn't like it

464
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,667
It won't be fair either, if
she gets the face she likes.

465
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,042
Let us toy with her for a while.

466
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:59,833
Fine, then we'll do the
same with her friend too.

467
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,000
Now you go and pick up the ball.

468
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:05,458
Hey, can't you see
that we're playing.

469
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,583
Godavari, draw a line damn it

470
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:08,417
-Hey!
-Ah...!

471
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:09,417
are we playing Kabbadi here?

472
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:11,583
Don't over do it,
come over here.

473
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:13,708
-Fine you keep scoring
-Hey, the ball.

474
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,917
Sir, please Sir.

475
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:19,250
please, please, please---

476
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,250
Ey...move away from here.

477
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,333
Sir...please, please, please.

478
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,375
Please Sir!

479
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,167
-Please...!
-Mmmm

480
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,208
I'm saying yes to it, 'cause
you've been literally begging.

481
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,000
But one thing, you
should make a good film.

482
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:31,625
I'm very particular
about quality.

483
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:32,417
Understood!?

484
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,958
Sir, you're acting in it.
There's no room for errors.

485
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,875
You made my day.

486
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,917
Thank you, thank you,
thank you...so much.

487
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,750
We'll meet on Saturday, bye.

488
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:40,708
Hey, come on.

489
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:41,708
Hey, get lost.

490
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,125
He said yes to it.

492
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,667

Sir, please come.

528
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,375
Was the journey comfortable?

529
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,083
Journey really? from
Vadapalani to Valsaravakkam?

530
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,708
And you're inquiring
as if you got us here

531
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,792
has the shooting been canceled?

532
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,958
Sir, why are you being cynical?

533
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:10,792
The shooting is
happening right here.

00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,875
I don't think so. I've been
to Shankar Sir's shooting

536
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,667
there will be a big
team working actively.

537
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,667
Sir, if you're ready we
can take the first shot.

538
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,125
-How's it possible?
-Is there no Caravan?

539
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:19,708
Sir!?

540
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:20,917
-Caravan...Caravan
-There's no Caravan!?

541
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,125
Why there's no Caravan?

542
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,875
Sir, the entire budget of
this film is 20,000 rupees.

543
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:26,500
from which we've borrowed
5000 on interest.

544
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:28,250
So caravan would be impossible.

545
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,042
We believe in our script.

546
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,333
To hell with your script---

547
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:34,167
---my Guru Sunny Leone's movie doesn't
have a script neither dialogues.

548
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:37,083
all we hear is just ****.

549
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,250
that's fine---

550
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,167
---how do I get make-up
done and change costumes.

551
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,500
What if someone records
a video of me?

552
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:42,542
Who will answer to my family?

553
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:43,625
That's right, if
they record a video

554
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:44,667
Surprising Video---

555
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:45,875
---look at the youngster in it

556
00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:47,000
if you're a Tamizhan speak up

557
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,208
if something like this
happens, how can we take it?

558
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,792
-He's right!
-Sir, no one will record a video

559
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:51,708
I can guarantee, please
co-operate Sir.

560
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,708
Hey, get a cold drink for Sir.

561
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:56,958
Sir, please have this.

562
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,458
What's this?

563
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:01,917
So, is this what you were
calling a cold drink?

564
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,250
Fine, give one for me as well.

565
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,875
Actually we're out of cold drink

566
00:28:07,917 --> 00:28:09,667
we just have water packet. Is that fine?

567
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,250
Why are wasting that one me---

568
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,583
--just open that ice box

569
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:13,833
I'll just lick it good.

570
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:14,875
Sharing is caring.

571
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:15,583
Hey!

572
00:28:16,292 --> 00:28:17,167
Fine, give me that

573
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:19,083
It's been half an hour
since I've asked you

574
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,042
Where can I change?

575
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:21,875
Sir, what's wrong with you---

576
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,833
our Heroine itself is
changing behind the tree.

577
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:24,542
but you're---

578
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:26,792
---what kind of shameless
heroine is she?

579
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,542
Are you that Heroine?

580
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:43,167
Ya!

581
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,083
I'm yet to accept
you as a director.

582
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:49,500
And you've already
jumped in as an actor.

583
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,250
Sir, I'm a theater artist

584
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,125
which theater? Is it
Jothi or Sathyam?

585
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,417
Why are your lips bleeding?

586
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,333
This is lipstick not blood.

587
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,917
Why have you bloated
your lips with it?

588
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:00,458
Lipstick it seems.

589
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,708
I'll tone it down

590
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,417
Shall we run through
the dialogues once?

591
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,333
Green background

592
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,083
I'm sitting alone on the bench

593
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,375
cool breeze

594
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,833
You're walking towards me

595
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,875
with love in your eyes.

596
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,875
You're very beautiful

597
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:16,583
I really like you

598
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,583
I wish to live a
century with you.

599
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:22,083
I love you!

600
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,167
That's your dialogue.

601
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,000
"I Love You"

602
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:28,708
It's very lame

603
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,250
who proposes like
that these days?

604
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,417
Sir, this happened in my life.

605
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:35,875
On guy came forward
and asked me.

606
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,250
It's based on a true story.

607
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,208
I don't think he would've
said a century though

608
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,583
Cinema is all about
turning 1 into 100.

609
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:42,292
Oh...!

610
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,542
She is speaking as if
she invented Cinema.

611
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,375
Sir, isn't this
scene impressive.

612
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:50,792
Will you take my advice?

613
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:52,583
Thinking out of the
box is the trend now.

614
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,875
I have an idea, see
if you like it.

615
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:57,042
A beautiful village,

616
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,958
it's called "Valagapatti"

617
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:00,250
Camera rolling...!

618
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:01,000
Action!

619
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,083
Isn't this beautiful?

620
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,958
Have you ever been to a village?

621
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:07,375
Hello, it was my idea to come
over here before marriage.

622
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:09,167
Hope you didn't forget
looking at the village.

623
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,458
Get ready once we reach there

624
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,083
Have to meet the Village Officer.

625
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:13,708
There are few formalities
to sell the house.

626
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:17,333
Look at that.

627
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,083
We use to stay here before
Dad got transferred.

628
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,625
It's been 18 years since
we left this place.

629
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:30,208
No matter what happens, I
can't forget this house.

630
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,042
Hey try catching me---

631
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:34,458
---Shiva don't run,
stop right there.

632
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,875
You won't be able to catch me.

633
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:59,125
Hey, be careful while
you're playing.

634
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,083
Ey! Enough of playtime,
get back to studies.

635
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,750
I'm just flooded with
memories right now.

636
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,083
How's my house?

637
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:17,958
Do you like it?

638
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:18,583
A lot!

639
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,458
Music used to be on audio
cassettes those days

640
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,417
the rewind button doesn't
work on our player

641
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,250
so sister and I use a pencil to
rewind and then listen to them.

642
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:40,250
Manually tuned radio

643
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,833
when songs on TV gets blurry

644
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:47,167
getting on terrace
to fix the antenna.

645
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,833
A black phone, used to
dial with a finger.

646
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,333
the next generation will
never come to know of this.

647
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,708
It's not extinct,
but have changed.

648
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,542
iPods, iPhone etc...

649
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:05,583
...progress baby!

650
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:07,042
What kind of progress?

651
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,500
Those days were of
grandmother stories and food

652
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,375
Tamizh which wasn't
polluted by English.

653
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:13,208
birds chirping, where did it all go?

654
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:15,792
As a result of evolution,
they disappeared.

655
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,083
Wonder what kind of Evolution

656
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:20,250
when we're suppressing our own
identity, evolution doesn't matter.

657
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,333
Ok Tiger calm down, you win.

658
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:23,125
Come on!

659
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,167
Shiva, let's comeback to
your nostalgia later---

660
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,958
---the village officer might
leave 'cause we're late.

661
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,167
My mom used to come all the
way here to fetch water.

662
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,375
What the hell. She
used to come so far?

663
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:49,583
That's when pipeline was
introduced to our village

664
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:51,625
Sir, my name is Kumarasamy.

665
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm coming from Valagapatti

666
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:56,792
heard that our village has been
given the facility of water pipes.

667
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:59,208
But my house has been
left out on the list.

668
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:01,042
When I went to the office,

669
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,750
they asked me to meet you
and get a signature.

670
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,417
Fine, make a payment of 5000.

671
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:07,542
Will get it done.

672
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:09,458
Sir, I've already
made the payment.

673
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,208
Ration card and other
documents has been submitted.

674
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,792
Make a payment of 5000 rupees.

675
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:16,458
Your house will get a pipeline.

676
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:23,208
After that my mom used to come
here for long to fetch water.

677
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,500
But, why? If at all
he had paid the money

678
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,917
the house would've got water.

679
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,250
My father is a very stubborn guy.

680
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,458
He lived an honest life
away from bribery.

681
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,083
Take this.

682
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:41,958
-Tell me
-Hello Sir!

683
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:42,917
My name is Shiva---

684
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:45,583
---there used to be a Headmaster
in the name of Muthumanickam

685
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:46,625
I'm his grandson.

686
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:49,000
Oh...! Are you Kumarasamy's son?

687
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:50,250
-Yes Sir.
-Sit down.

688
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:51,625
-Thanks
-Sit down please.

689
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,000
How's your Dad doing these days?

690
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,417
Last year he died due
to heart attack.

691
00:33:58,542 --> 00:33:59,833
-He died?
-Yes.

692
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,625
Oh God, he was
such a good person.

693
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,333
That's right Sir, it came
as a shock to us too.

694
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,500
Sir, it's nothing

695
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:07,000
we're here to sell
our grandpa's house

696
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:09,792
My passport, driving
license, everything is inside

697
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,458
I have Dad's old ration card

698
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,750
Proving that I'm
Muthumanickam's grandson

699
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:16,542
if you issue me a legal
heir, will be helpful Sir.

700
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:17,542
Sure I will.

701
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,000
-Definitely will give it to you
-Ok Sir.

702
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:22,625
Ah...if you make a
payment of 10,000

703
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:23,542
I'll give you the letter.

704
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,708
Sir, why do I have pay 10,000?

705
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,250
My grandfather is from this village,

706
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:30,958
you've already mentioned that
you knew my father.

707
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:32,958
I'm not asking something
which isn't here.

708
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:34,792
This is not something new, Son.

709
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:36,417
I usually ask for 15,000/-

it will be risky.

any of this to me.

Bank doesn't approve a loan,
'cause you've become responsible.

830

I'm aware of it.

00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,333
Hoping for him to get better---

886
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,875
---I was expecting
know more about him.

887
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:25,917
Oh, that case---

888
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:29,167
---fine, why have you
come all the way for him?

889
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:31,583
Lodged the complaint,
finished with formalities

890
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:34,042
and get back to your work.

891
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,125
Sir, that man is
struggling for his life.

892
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:37,708
Still we don't know who is he---

893
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:38,875
---identity is unknown.

894
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:39,917
Firstly who are you?

895
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:41,375
Why should I answer to you?

896
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:42,667
Social Worker!

897
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:44,250
Name is Gowri Thiruselvan.

898
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:45,500
Oh...!

899
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:46,958
So what, if you're
a Social worker

900
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:49,000
who is serving you at home?

901
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,208
You must have help
for that, right?

902
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:55,250
Don't think I'll let this go, if
you attack on personal matters.

903
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:57,708
Ours is this thick skin of NGO,

904
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,875
ego is pointless,
and we fear no one.

905
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:03,958
Then, we'll have to take
action on a different level.

906
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:05,083
What will you do?

907
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,625
Will you publish
it in THE HINDU?

908
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:07,792
Please go ahead.

909
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:09,542
Sir, I think you're unaware

910
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:12,042
according to Right to Information Act.

911
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:15,500
If we file a petition at Governors
office, he has to answer.

912
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,917
What action have you taken
pertaining to this boy's case?

913
00:47:18,042 --> 00:47:20,250
Have you sent an email or a fax?

914
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:22,833
If you don't give an explanation
on why you haven't found anything

915
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:25,375
we can take legal
action against you.

916
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,708
Do whatever you can

917
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,708
it's a country with a
population of 100 crores.

918
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:30,833
Where will I look?

919
00:47:30,917 --> 00:47:32,417
Shall we try magic?

920
00:47:33,042 --> 00:47:33,625
Ah!?

921
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,667
If I come to know about
anything, will call you.

922
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:36,875
You can leave now.

923
00:47:39,417 --> 00:47:42,667
In order to save a life,
I didn't think twice

924
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:43,958
I put my signature
on that register.

925
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:46,208
Doctor had mentioned
about your accident.

926
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:49,500
In a Govt. Hospital's mortuary

927
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:52,750
better than getting
cremated as an orphan

928
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:54,875
thought it will be
beneficial to you.

929
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:57,417
I pretended to be his mother.

930
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,250
thought about it and
signed once again.

931
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:01,750
Why? What happened?

932
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,500
Mistaking me for him---

933
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:09,167
---they're trying to kill me.

934
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:13,042
Looking at all of it, I don't
think it was an accident

935
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,167
but a murder.

936
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,333
Murder uh!?

937
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:20,917
I was just thinking of
giving you a face---

938
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:24,500
but that face will bring
you so many issues

939
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:26,125
never expected it.

940
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:27,708
I'm---

941
00:48:28,292 --> 00:48:29,375
---what do you want me to do?

942
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:31,708
Look here, it's not your fault

943
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:35,792
If you come to know anything about
it, you have my phone number

944
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,083
please keep me informed.

945
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:38,292
Definitely, Sure!

946
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:39,833
I don't know what to say...!

947
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:42,000
Please be careful.

948
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,125
-Tell me Mom
-Shiva...!

949
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,667
It's really late, why
haven't you come home yet?

950
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:53,375
I'm coming home

951
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:55,042
do you want Dosa or
Chapathi for dinner?

952
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:56,042
I'll come and tell you.

953
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:57,542
I---

954
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,042
Hello!

955
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,000
Shiva!?

956
00:50:09,292 --> 00:50:11,792
How long will it take
for you to get home?

957
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:40,292
These days even to buy a helmet
they do extreme research

958
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,917
but you're struggling here
with a stranger's face.

959
00:53:43,042 --> 00:53:44,792
You could've rather remained
with your burnt face.

960
00:53:45,792 --> 00:53:46,958
Don't know who is he?

961
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,917
No idea, why they're chasing me.

962
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:52,375
I'm worried about
Mom and Sister.

963
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,083
I'm not returning home,
until this is sorted.

964
00:53:55,417 --> 00:53:56,083
Hey...!

965
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:57,792
You're here now---

966
00:53:57,792 --> 00:54:00,667
---what if they assume this
is your house and kill me?

967
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:03,917
You're selfish---

968
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:06,292
---you want your family safe, but
doesn't matter if I get lynched.

969
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,750
Hey don't drink, you're
going to get a headache

970
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:14,083
not sure I'm going to
have my head anymore.

971
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,125
Headache it seems.

972
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:16,417
-Ey!
-Ah!

973
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:17,750
When we were at IOC---

974
00:54:17,792 --> 00:54:19,292
---there was a girl
who recognized me

975
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:20,125
Ya the voluptuous one.

976
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:22,000
If we ask her, she might
know something about him.

977
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:23,833
That's a great idea.

978
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:26,542
-What are you eating?
-Bubble Gum!

979
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:28,208
Here!

980
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,542
Ey!

981
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:31,250
Let that go

982
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:33,458
When was the last
time you met him?

983
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:34,917
The other day in the elevator.

984
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:35,917
Before that!?

985
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,417
This you can ask him yourself.

986
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:40,667
Few chapters are
lost at the moment.

987
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:43,792
He lost his memory due to a
head injury from an accident.

988
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:44,833
Oh my God!

989
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:47,167
He has written your last meet
on is thigh to remember.

990
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:48,333
Do you want to see it?

991
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:48,958
No, no, no, no!

992
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:49,792
It's just on the thigh

993
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:52,333
I actually met him once---

994
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:55,167
---on a train from
Trichy to Chennai.

995
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,250
While I was talking to him

996
00:54:57,292 --> 00:54:59,500
he mentioned his name as Shakthi

997
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,500
and his hometown is near Trichy.

998
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,958
I don't know anything
else about him.

999
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:05,042
Actually this is enough

1000
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:06,958
I'll use this information
to jog his memory.

1001
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,333
Thanks a lot.

1002
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:09,542
Ok, bye. Thank you.

1003
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:13,875
-Hello!
-Ma, this is Shiva speaking

1004
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,667
Hey Shiva! why didn't you
come home last night?

1005
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:17,542
where were you?

1006
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:19,417
Mom, you first listen to me
and stop asking questions.

1007
00:55:19,708 --> 00:55:21,250
I'm heading to Trichy for an
emergency pertaining to work

1008
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:24,042
You send across my clothes and
medical reports through Geetha.

1009
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:25,917
I'll return and
explain everything.

1010
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:26,750
For what!?

1011
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:28,667
Mom, please listen to what I have to say.
I'll explain it later.

1012
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:30,083
-Bye!
-Shiva!

1013
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:40,000
Hey you!
Shiva inside of Shakti!

1014
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,250
We just have a name---

1015
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:45,333
---with just that how do expect us to
find someone in a big city like Trichy.

1016
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,750
Are you going to
sing a family song?

1017
00:55:46,792 --> 00:55:49,000
Even if you do, no idea
if there's a family song.

1018
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:50,208
Get inside...

1019
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:52,125
Ya...Ya, 24!

1020
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:58,292
-Hey!
-Ah...

1021
00:55:58,333 --> 00:55:59,458
We didn't have anything---

1022
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,875
---at least we his name
and the city he lived in.

1023
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,750
When we get down in that city

1024
00:56:03,792 --> 00:56:05,958
someone who knows Shakthi
will come and speak to us.

1025
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:07,167
It's fine, if they
just come and talk

1026
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:08,792
just like how Vijay gets
shot in "Kaththi" movie

1027
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,500
what if you get shot like that?

1028
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:11,542
You're right

1029
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:13,625
people came Chennai to kill me

1030
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,250
don't you think, he'll
send someone to Trichy?

1031
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:17,042
We'll catch hold
of one from them,

1032
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:18,667
and say that I'm not the
one they're looking for.

1033
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,125
face transplant, accident
we'll make them understand.

1034
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:22,250
Our issue will be resolved.

1035
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:24,958
You're being too ambitious.

1036
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,125
I'm not taking this risk

1037
00:56:26,167 --> 00:56:28,083
Train is running at full speed.

1038
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:30,125
-Jump off it
-Ey...!

1039
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:33,042
Fine, either ways I'm
going to be killed.

1040
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,333
Hey, who are you?

1041
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:38,500
Girls are around, don't you
feel ashamed being half naked?

1042
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:39,375
Where are you headed?

1043
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:40,875
I'm heading to write NEET exam.

1044
00:56:40,958 --> 00:56:42,542
Then he's dressed right.

1045
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:44,292
Hey, then why are you
just wearing shorts?

1046
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:45,875
They'll strip him off it,
once he's reaches there.

1047
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,833
-Where are you going to write?
-Trivandrum!

1048
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:49,250
Why, isn't there a
place in our state?

1049
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,292
There's no vacancy in Tamilnadu.

1050
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,875
They have vacant places
to open liquor shops,

1051
00:56:53,917 --> 00:56:55,042
but there's no place
to write exams.

1052
00:56:55,083 --> 00:56:56,833
Hello, this time I'll
definitely clear the exam.

1053
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:57,625
All the best!

1054
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,000
Hey Shiva! what a surprise.

1055
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,750
-Hey, Hi.
-Hi!

1056
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,333
I've been trying to
contact you for a week

1057
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:05,667
It kept saying not reachable

1058
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:08,500
You know what, our short film
has reached 7 million views.

1059

1070

Sir is our producer.

1071
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:26,667

He's the one, who changed
the course of my life.

It's 'cause of him,
I'm a director now.

1078
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:36,375
I agreed to produce, 'cause
the Hero referred her.

1079

But she's been ranting about
 Linear - Nonlinear

1080
00:57:39,792 --> 00:57:41,292
I don't understand anything.

1081
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,792
I'm worried if I
can make profit.

Revolutionary Leader MGR's

1083
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,500
movie "Anbe Vaa", I've
seen it 50 times.

1084
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:51,667
I can narrate that
story in my sleep.

1085
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:53,167
This is his problem

1086
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:54,875
he's still stuck in 1970's

1087
00:57:54,917 --> 00:57:56,542

a lot since then

1088

Brother, you tell me one thing

1092
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,958
how should be a climax?

1093
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:07,292
A Hero should fight
leaping like a tiger,

1094
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:09,958
and kill the villain. That's
when audience will applaud.

1095
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:11,750
Isn't that the
successful formula?

1096
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:13,000
Only then, we can make money.

Exactly...!

1100
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:18,875
Sir, no matter how strong you're

1101
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:20,917
you can't kill someone
with your bare hands.

1102
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:23,000
What are the chances?

1103
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,250
Shiva, but I've read in a novel

1104
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:26,750
this is my film's climax.

1105
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:30,417
If Epidefrine is induced into
someone's body in abundance

1106
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:32,125
will die of excess  adrenaline.

1107
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:34,917
Not only that, traces of it won't
be captured in Post-Mortem report.

1108
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:37,708
It's available at the Hospital
to keep the patients stable.

1109
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:40,167
And if adrenaline is
injected in excess,

1110
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,333
they'll definitely die.

These things should be cinematic

1114
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Sir you can decide after
watching the entire film.

1115
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:49,000
I don't I'll be in a state to
talk after watching the film.

you mentioned about explaining things
to the people who are chasing

1120
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,500

understand Face Transplant?

like you, ugly---

-is it so?

Oh no!

what did you say?

1131
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:17,042
Face Transport uh!?

1132
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,875
It's not transport,
it's face transplant.

1133
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:23,250
His face was changed
with a surgery,

1134
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:25,833
now he looks exactly like
Ultimate Star Ajith.

1135

1143

Yes I do.

How do you know that?

1145
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,833
Wasn't that explained
in the movie Ghajini.

1146

pertaining to this

1147

That's right, you're great.

Even if we look for the
ones who are chasing us,

1150
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,250
I doubt they'll understand
what we have to say.

1151

1152
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:17,917
Nothing!

The thing I asked on the
day I won the competition,

1155
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:23,458
was inquiring about that.

1156
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:32,000
I should get the feeling of
living with you for a century

1157
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:35,208
I need to have that trust

1158
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:38,625
When I look at your
face, that trust---

1159
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:40,250
---isn't evident.

1163

1164
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:50,458
but the girl is not
that good looking.

1165
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:51,917
I'll feel bad about it.

1166
01:00:52,542 --> 01:00:53,375
So, let's not.

It's for your own good.

1168

I'm not angry for
what you've said.

I said the exact
thing to one person.

1170

Now I get it, how hurt
he would've been.

1171

I'll definitely apologize to
him, If I meet him someday.

1172
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,375
If so, you'll have
to apologize to me.

1232
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:50,958
Hey!

1233
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:52,208
Be careful

1234
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:54,375
Hey...hey, come on move.

1235
01:04:58,542 --> 01:04:59,417
Give me the car keys.

1236
01:06:09,375 --> 01:06:10,000
Sir!

1237
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:13,333
Sir!

1238
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:15,458
don't close your
eyes, look at me.

1239
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:17,375
Look at me, Sir.

1240
01:06:18,292 --> 01:06:19,042
Sir!

1241
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:28,042
Grandma, listen to me.

1242
01:06:28,542 --> 01:06:30,708
My grand daughter
thinks I'm not well.

1243
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:31,875
It's nothing, just
show me your hand.

1244
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:33,708
It's just fever, you will
be fine with an injection.

1245
01:06:33,708 --> 01:06:35,000
-Ok!?
-Ok, Doctor.

1246
01:06:35,042 --> 01:06:37,125
Please get this injection.

1247
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:42,667
Hey, he's right there.

1248
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:47,792
Ey!

1249
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,250
Shiva what happened?

1250
01:06:51,917 --> 01:06:54,750
I have no idea, he was
walking on the road.

1251
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:55,625
I didn't see---

1252
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:59,208
---another problem to add on.

1253
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,458
Is he alive or dead?

1254
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:01,292
Not sure.

1255
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:11,208
What happened Doctor?

1256
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,167
Sister ask Dr.Lakshmi to
get to OT right away.

1257
01:07:13,542 --> 01:07:14,042
Ok Doctor.

1258
01:07:16,042 --> 01:07:18,125
It's a head injury
and mild concussion

1259
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:21,500
anything could be told, only
after 24 hrs of observation.

1260
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:23,125
I think you'll have to wait.

1261
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:46,500
Shakthi!

1262
01:08:18,083 --> 01:08:18,917
AGRO TECH!

1263
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:20,708
This is our team's
9 months project.

1264
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:22,208
If you see the end users here,

1265
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,583
are the farmers in Netherlands

1266
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:25,333
And the key features
of Agro Tech are

1267
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:26,625
Smart Irrigation methods,

1268
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:28,333
with minimum usage
of ground water.

1269
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:30,333
alert messages with
weather predictions.

1270
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:32,000
video tutorials by experts

1271
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,542
for effective crop management.

1272
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:34,542
Did you understand
anything of it?

1273
01:08:35,417 --> 01:08:36,708
Did you understand anything?

1274
01:08:38,042 --> 01:08:39,542
You're pretending to
be a first bencher

1275
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:41,375
Baldy, just kidding

1276
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:42,750
-you continue
-Maya!

1277
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:45,417
Umm...by customizing
basic Google maps,

1278
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:47,333
we've created a
Hydro-Geological map

1279
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:50,042
through this the farmer with
their registered lands,

1280
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,833
can check the ground
water availability.

1281
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:54,500
Using our App, the products
farmers manufacture,

1282
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:56,083
can fix a price of their own

1283
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:58,750
for instance how a middle man
makes money in our country

1284
01:08:58,792 --> 01:08:59,417
that won't happen
here with this App.

1285
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:00,833
Not only that

1286
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:03,000
when the agricultural business
is giving them profits

1287
01:09:03,042 --> 01:09:04,000
they won't tend to take a loan.

1288
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:06,292
As there's no loan taken,
there will be no suicides.

1289
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:07,375
That's all you honor.

1290
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:11,125
Yes, our 9 months of handwork

1291
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:13,167
will decide a
Nation's agriculture.

1292
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:13,833
Thank you!

1293
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:15,083
Great job Shakthi!

1294
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:16,000
I did it too

1295
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,125
great job to you also.

1296
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:17,958
she was a part of it too.

1297
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,333
great job to you as well.

1298
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:21,708
Wait outside for couple of
minutes, we'll get back to you.

1299
01:09:22,083 --> 01:09:24,417
-Parthiv
Hi Chandru, how's it going?

1300
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:25,750
Everything is perfect man

1301
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:28,333
Alright, have they given
the project files?

1302
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:29,833
They've given the
files, no problem.

1303
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:31,500
Ya, ok then we'll
take care of it.

1304
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,833
Ok, keep me updated.

1305
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:34,875
Chandru---

1306
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:35,625
Shakthi---

1307
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:37,792
---you come to office by 11am

1308
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:39,208
what time do you leave
in the evening?

1309
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:40,458
Ah...8pm!

1310
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:41,958
But working hours are intact

1311
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,917
that's fine---

1312
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:45,042
---you're watching You
Tube on office internet

1313
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:47,792
Flirting with girls
at the food-court

1314
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:50,333
moreover using office
phone for personal calls.

1315
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,625
Are we in a school, Chandru?

1316
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:55,417
complaining about You
Tube and flirting

1317
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:58,333
Even you guys know, this
is false accusation

1318
01:09:58,792 --> 01:10:02,125
before the deadline given, I worked
overtime and have delivered the project.

1319
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,333
What are you trying to get at?

1320
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:05,125
Shakthi---

1321
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,250
---you've been sacked.

1322
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,625
We've fired you from this job.

1323
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:11,167
Sir, this is extremely unfair.

1324
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,042
You appreciated
during presentation,

1325
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,167
not even a prior notice given

1326
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:16,125
What's unfair?

1327
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:18,250
Including you, we're
terminating 100 people today.

1328
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:20,708
this is a routine of
roll normalization.

1329
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:22,708
Evening 5pm is your deadline.

1330
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:23,958
Give your resignation by then.

1331
01:10:25,042 --> 01:10:25,792
ID card

1332
01:10:25,792 --> 01:10:26,750
Sir, please understand

1333
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,458
see I have no other, please
give me your ID card,

1334
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,500
Sir, my family is
dependent on this

1335
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,042
please Sir.

1336
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:33,417
don't create a fuss, please hand
over the ID card and leave.

1337
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:35,208
Sir, please Sir.

1338
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:36,958
Hey, what happened?

1339
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:39,125
-Surrender your ID card.
-Sir please consider.

1340
01:10:39,792 --> 01:10:41,208
They've fired me.

1341
01:10:41,292 --> 01:10:42,500
You got fired?

1342
01:10:42,542 --> 01:10:44,542
Didn't we just submit a project?

1343
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:46,833
To be fair, they should've
given an appraisal or hike

1344
01:10:47,667 --> 01:10:49,917
I think they've mistaken,
I did this entire project

1345
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:51,833
I'll speak to Chandru,
you don't get tensed

1346
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:52,500
I'll speak to him

1347
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,792
What is it Sami, has the
company given you a car?

1348
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:56,375
they've fired you as well,
give me your ID card.

1349
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,125
They fired me too?

1350
01:10:58,167 --> 01:10:59,042
and you're informing that?

1351
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:00,917
call them, I want to
talk to the manager.

1352
01:11:00,917 --> 01:11:02,667
I can't give it without
a proper explanation.

1353
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:04,292
-I don't care you're terminated.
-Don't lay your hands on me

1354
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:05,625
-Security
-Hey get lost

1355
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:07,125
Sami, don't understand
what I'm saying

1356
01:11:07,167 --> 01:11:09,000
I won't leave 'cause you
asking me to, call the manager

1357
01:11:09,042 --> 01:11:10,458
I want to talk to him---

1358
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,542
You can talk to him outside.

1359
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:12,792
Hey look here

1360
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,083
Ey...get out!

1361
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:37,333
They were together as
a team for 3 years

1362
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:39,917
they made them chuck
us out of the work

1363
01:11:39,917 --> 01:11:42,375
kept saying "Our Company",
damn with their company.

1364
01:11:43,167 --> 01:11:44,958
I'm scared thinking about
the payment due next month

1365
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,833
Hey, I'm due 95,000
on my credit card

1366
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:49,292
everyone has issues.

1367
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,500
My friend is working as a
Team Leader at Hexagon

1368
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:54,208
shall I approach him for the job?

1369
01:11:54,958 --> 01:11:55,792
Not required

1370
01:11:56,417 --> 01:11:59,333
How long are we going to be enslaved
to these foreign companies?

1371
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:02,708
Were we born to do this?

1372
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,208
What else can we do?

1373
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:07,333
We're not in this
IT job accidentally

1374
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:09,292
we've graduated in
B.E.Computer Science.

1375
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:11,167
What else do we know
other than coding?

1376
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:12,958
Is that all we know?

1377
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:13,792
Think hard

1378
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:15,917
Hey, we're not in a
situation to think

1379
01:12:15,917 --> 01:12:17,167
they've fired us

1380
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:19,375
we have worked for a year
in that Agro Tech project

1381
01:12:19,542 --> 01:12:21,750
I can only think of Netherlands
agriculture, even in my sleep

1382
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:23,583
we have this knowledge right?

1383
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:25,500
About Netherlands agriculture?

1384
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:27,250
Why are we still stuck
up on Netherlands?

1385
01:12:27,292 --> 01:12:29,917
We'll think of aspects to improve
agriculture on our lands.

1386
01:12:30,042 --> 01:12:31,208
What are you saying?

1387
01:12:32,167 --> 01:12:33,625
I have 5 acres of
land in my village,

1388
01:12:35,542 --> 01:12:36,625
I've decided

1389
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:38,875
I'm going to do agriculture

1390
01:12:39,292 --> 01:12:40,458
We'll start it now, Maya

1391
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:44,125
Just by inking your fingers once
in 5 years, won't bring a change.

1392
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:47,625
We'll have to get down in
the arena and work for it.

1393
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:50,042
You're right, and
it's good to hear

1394
01:12:50,417 --> 01:12:53,417
instead of working without
a clue for a foreign land

1395
01:12:53,542 --> 01:12:55,792
we can be rightful
owners to our own land.

1396
01:13:33,833 --> 01:13:35,833
How long will you
be hogging the pump

1397
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:38,250
I have a infant waiting at home

1398
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:40,958
I just need two pots of water

1399
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:42,792
let me take it, let me

1400
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:45,417
Hey...Panchali

1401
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:46,750
get that pot here

1402
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:48,708
get that pot here damn it.

1403
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,500
Be careful, don't spill it.

1404
01:13:51,708 --> 01:13:52,750
Here, take this too.

1405
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:55,042
We've been waiting
in hot sun for long,

1406
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:57,125
how is it fair to
jump the queue?

1407
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:58,917
don't we seem humans to you

1408
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:01,625
Hey, I'm talking to you
get back in the line.

1409
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:08,083
-Hey Shakthi
-Fatso!

1410
01:14:08,375 --> 01:14:09,500
-Brother!
-Maya Ma!

1411
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:10,875
How are you!?

1412
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
So you're the fat
brother from village

1413
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:15,167
you're chubby and cute.

1414
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:16,958
Shakthi dear---

1415
01:14:17,042 --> 01:14:18,417
---fat boy

1416
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:19,833
Are you fine Son?

1417
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:20,958
Mom, these are my friends

1418
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,083
-Come in Son.
-Hello Aunty.

1419
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:23,667
We both started the job together

1420
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:24,833
and have been fired
together as well.

1421
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:26,958
Oh no, even you got fired?

1422
01:14:27,167 --> 01:14:27,958
That's right.

1423
01:14:29,792 --> 01:14:31,792
Mom, did you tell Dad?

1424
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:33,417
I'm scared to tell him.

1425
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,292
You tell him yourself
when he's in a good mood.

1426
01:14:36,542 --> 01:14:38,458
If I say anything
he'll shout at me.

1427
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:42,083
Son, how many days are
you on leave this time?

1428
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:43,583
Dad, about that---

1429
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:45,208
---at least this time
try staying for long.

1430
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:46,250
Not just few days Uncle,

1431
01:14:46,292 --> 01:14:47,417
we're going to stay
here for good.

1432
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:48,625
Just show tell me
which is my room---

1433
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:49,458
This is my friend Shanmugam.

1434
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:51,250
-Hello uncle.
-This is Shakthi's brother Dong Lee.

1435
01:14:51,292 --> 01:14:52,125
Hi!

1436
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:55,292
We're not leave, but
have quit our jobs.

1437
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:58,250
They didn't quit,
they got fired.

1438
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:00,625
-Fatso, take this inside.
-Let that go.

1439
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,875
It's become routine
with the IT companies

1440
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,250
650 were sacked in Verizon

1441
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:08,333
you have a 3 years experience

1442
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,000
you can find a job elsewhere.

1443
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:13,792
I'm not going to
look for a job, Dad.

1444
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,250
I'm going to do agriculture

1445
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:17,708
have you gone nuts?

1446
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:19,458
I worked hard for your studies,

1447
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,542
and you want to
return to sludge

1448
01:15:21,542 --> 01:15:23,625
this is just not
sludge but a tunnel

1449
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:27,500
When I was working in IT, I found
out suitable methods for irrigation

1450
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:29,417
with extensive research and
have developed an App.

1451
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:31,208
Instead of doing that
for a foreign country,

1452
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,083
why shouldn't I do
it for our village?

1453
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:35,000
Basically agriculture is
the back bone of India.

1454
01:15:35,042 --> 01:15:37,333
70% of the population is
involved in agriculture.

1455
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:38,792
You've read about Verizon,

1456
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:39,708
but unaware of this.

1457
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:40,750
I'm disappointed.

1458
01:15:40,917 --> 01:15:42,333
Ey...you guys have gone crazy.

1459
01:15:42,458 --> 01:15:44,583
We need water for agriculture.

1460
01:15:44,917 --> 01:15:48,750
Which isn't available, that's why I've sold
my land and planning to settle in Chennai.

1461
01:15:48,792 --> 01:15:50,375
Who said there's water
available in Chennai?

1462
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:51,167
-Eh!?
-Useless buggers

1463
01:15:51,333 --> 01:15:54,375
Councilor has mentioned that our
land will fetch us good price

1464
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:57,333
he has given 1 lac as
advance yesterday.

1465
01:15:57,417 --> 01:15:59,125
Start looking for a job
in another company,

1466
01:16:00,042 --> 01:16:01,542
Brother get me my bag,

1467
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:03,292
-Stay back son,
-I don't want a room

1468
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:04,833
We'll go elsewhere
and do agriculture

1469
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:28,125
Is this the Councilor's house?

1470
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,167
Damn, it's so huge

1471
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:32,750
Even Pondicherry CM's
house won't be this big.

1472
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:35,208
I think he must've been
to Kovathur as well.

1473
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:38,500
Get inside stuff yourself with meat
balls and inquire about the place

1474
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:39,708
Ah..tell me brother.

1475
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:40,542
Hello Sir!

1476
01:16:40,792 --> 01:16:41,708
Come in, brother.

1477
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,208
Did Dad send you?

1478
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,417
I just had a word with the astrologer
for a good date to register.

1479
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:47,750
Day after is Ashtami and Navami

1480
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:48,958
so he suggested to
do it tomorrow.

1481
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,792
Ah Sir...I'm here to
talk to you about it.

1482
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,083
As of now, we don't have the
idea of selling the land.

1483
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:57,792
that's why I came down to return the
advance and inform not to register.

1484
01:16:58,417 --> 01:16:59,292
Brother---

1485
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:02,667
---your land is going to
be used in a huge project.

1486
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:03,583
So---

1487
01:17:04,292 --> 01:17:05,792
---the payment
will be a big one.

1488
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:08,542
Ah...no Sir. We don't wish
to sell it at the moment.

1489
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:09,625
We've changed our minds.

1490
01:17:11,917 --> 01:17:13,458
Get those tablets for
Blood pressure damn it.

1491
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:15,208
Get lost!

1492
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:20,792
Are you trying to threaten me with
this person and hike the price?

1493
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:22,375
It's not like that

1494
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:24,125
Sir have a good look at me

1495
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,708
Do you seriously
feel threatened?

1496
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:29,708
Days are gone for a
villain to look dreadful

1497
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:32,750
wearing glasses and doing
villainous stuff is the trend now

1498
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:33,625
Damn funny, Sir.

1499
01:17:35,542 --> 01:17:37,000
I'm damn serious about it.

1500
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,417
Your father is,
Head of the Village.

1501
01:17:40,167 --> 01:17:43,208
if he returns the money,
he'll set a bad example

1502
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,917
then everyone in the village
will start to do the same.

1503
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,375
What can we do about it?

1504
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:49,500
We don't wish to sell it now.

1505
01:17:49,542 --> 01:17:50,917
Just take back your advance.

1506
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:56,083
What the hell are you going
to do with that land?

1507
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,542
That we'll take care of it.

1508
01:17:58,208 --> 01:17:58,792
Sir!

1509
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:00,250
Thank you Sir!

1510
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:03,250
Sir I have a doubt

1511
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:06,583
are those award given to
you for good work done?

1512
01:18:06,792 --> 01:18:07,292
Get lost!

1513
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:20,208
Look here Shakthi

1514
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:21,458
just 'cause you're my son

1515
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,417
we can't decide
anything in haste

1516
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:26,667
village people's decision will be
the final verdict of Panchayat.

1517
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:28,542
Right, that will be fair.

1518
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:29,708
What is it now?

1519
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:30,792
Listen---

1520
01:18:30,917 --> 01:18:32,417
for past 2-3 generations

1521
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,042
agriculture is missing
from our village

1522
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:35,542
agriculture which is
depleting at present

1523
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:37,042
we have to give a life to it

1524
01:18:37,042 --> 01:18:39,667
Has he gone crazy!?

1525
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:41,125
There's no water
to use in toilets

1526
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:42,583
and he's talking
about agriculture

1527
01:18:42,583 --> 01:18:44,500
Just 'cause we don't believe in doing
it, our village is in this state.

1528
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:46,875
So water is the issue here?

1529
01:18:47,792 --> 01:18:50,708
The Kalyani river is
gone dry for years

1530
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:53,750
we don't have water
even for basic needs

1531
01:18:53,917 --> 01:18:57,542
But the Poongoodi river 20kms off
the village, during heavy rains

1532
01:18:57,583 --> 01:19:00,458
the excess water overflows
without being used

1533
01:19:01,292 --> 01:19:04,167
My plan is to divert that
water towards our village.

1534
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:07,375
I don't think their idea
will be a practical one.

1535
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,542
You don't think so right?
How will you?

1536
01:19:09,792 --> 01:19:12,958
In the last 25 years, has anyone
earned profits doing agriculture?

1537
01:19:13,542 --> 01:19:15,792
Have you bought a house? May be
have sold your house instead

1538
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:17,542
At the same time, a
Real Estate owner

1539
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:18,458
sand contractor

1540
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:20,000
and Bar owner has
been making profits

1541
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,750
But farmers have been
committing suicides

1542
01:19:22,292 --> 01:19:24,083
Person who have
swindled in crores

1543
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:25,625
evades to a foreign country

1544
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:27,583
But a loan of 6000
taken for a pump set,

1545
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:28,542
will be beaten up by Police.

1546
01:19:28,583 --> 01:19:29,917
It's not that we
can't change this

1547
01:19:29,917 --> 01:19:31,833
but if they change, where
else they will swindle from

1548
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:34,333
They will go to an extent, letting
the corporate get into agriculture

1549
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:36,500
'Cause he funds the
expenses for Elections.

1550
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:38,917
They won't think of
changing anything

1551
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,250
but we can change
if we decide to.

1552
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:41,583
that's what our
plan is all about.

1553
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:43,333
We'll give you a
presentation now

1554
01:19:44,417 --> 01:19:45,667
This is Poongoodi river

1555
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:48,042
after enough usage
of that village

1556
01:19:48,167 --> 01:19:50,500
the rest of the water just
flows in vain into the sea.

1557
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:52,583
In the path of that river---

1558
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:56,625
---that is, if we dig
a channel for 20 kms

1559
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,083
the water from that river

1560
01:19:58,083 --> 01:20:00,625
is linked to our
village Kalyani river

1561
01:20:00,667 --> 01:20:02,875
the pond and wells
will be filled

1562
01:20:02,917 --> 01:20:05,708
and we can use that water for
our village's agriculture.

1563
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:08,958
post which excess water will flow
into the sea through Kalyani River.

1564
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:46,542
There are 134 crores
consumers in our country

1565
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:48,875
In spite of it, one
business which runs on loss

1566
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:50,042
is Agriculture.

1567
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,583
Everywhere there's a
scarcity of water

1568
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:57,125
to overcome the scarcity, first we
should start linking rivers in India.

1569
01:20:57,542 --> 01:20:58,708
This is our plan.

1570
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:00,542
If we achieve this

1571
01:21:00,542 --> 01:21:02,208
our village agriculture won't
be dependent on rains.

1572
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:04,500
It will rather be
dependent on our hard work

1573
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,583
and the water which will
run along the year.

1574
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:08,125
This scheme seems
to be a good one.

1575
01:21:08,167 --> 01:21:10,000
If we ask our MLA,
he'll do it himself.

1576
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:11,208
As if he'll be willing to.

1577
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:12,792
It's been 50 years,

1578
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:16,042
your MLA and others who we elected
could've resolved the cauvery issue

1579
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:18,458
Your MLA, do you know
what his business?

1580
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,417
He contracts Sand.

1581
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:21,208
If our rivers start flowing,

1582
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,500
and if we start irrigation,
how will he get to sell sand?

1583
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,208
Hey...!

1584
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,750
If you trust these youngsters---

1585
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:29,625
---they'll get you
stranded with nothing.

1586
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:33,167
They're a generation of
live-in relationships.

1587
01:21:33,917 --> 01:21:36,125
If you listen to their
ideas and follow them---

1588
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:37,833
---you'll regret forever.

1589
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:40,833
Instead sell it all to me

1590
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,167
and be happy with the money
it will fetch you guys.

1591
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:44,167
Oh God!

1592
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:48,708
Son, it was 40 years ago

1593
01:21:49,083 --> 01:21:51,417
that's how I saw our
village from your eyes.

1594
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:53,500
Before I die,

1595
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,417
please change the
fate of this village.

1596
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:00,708
Take this---

1597
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:03,250
---this is what I can offer

1598
01:22:04,417 --> 01:22:05,500
My dear!

1599
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:16,167
It's a good project

1600
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,083
it's a good thing that youngsters like
you coming forward for agriculture.

1601
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:21,125
Thank you so much Sir.

1602
01:22:21,292 --> 01:22:23,292
You're the first person,
who has spoken with hope.

1603
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:24,708
Whoever we went to,

1604
01:22:24,833 --> 01:22:26,792
instead of checking what
the project is about

1605
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:28,250
they're keen on how to
reject the proposal.

1606
01:22:28,375 --> 01:22:30,125
It's useless in trying
to change them.

1607
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:31,917
But you three,

1608
01:22:31,917 --> 01:22:34,000
don't let your confidence down.

1609
01:22:35,042 --> 01:22:37,875
Just make sure to check,
what exactly they need.

1610
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:39,875
What else, they're
expecting money

1611
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:41,500
but they're not asking for it.

1612
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:44,292
They won't ask you

1613
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:45,792
It's you, who has got the need

1614
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,250
you will have to

1615
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:50,167
find out from them, what
they actually expect.

1616
01:22:50,208 --> 01:22:51,083
Then why the hell---

1617
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:52,958
-Ey...!
-are they getting paid?

1618
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:53,708
Listen---

1619
01:22:53,792 --> 01:22:55,167
---I don't belong
to that category

1620
01:22:56,167 --> 01:22:57,000
Look here---

1621
01:22:57,167 --> 01:22:59,417
Tamilnadu Water and Drainage

1622
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,083
TWAD

1623
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:02,917
If they give an approval

1624
01:23:03,042 --> 01:23:06,542
I can help as much as I
can within my limits.

1625
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:07,333
Thanks Sir.

1626
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,500
Listen, I've done
as much as I can

1627
01:23:09,542 --> 01:23:10,667
this is such an old bike

1628
01:23:10,667 --> 01:23:11,833
be thankful it's running.

1629
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:12,500
Old really...!

1630
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,167
A 60 year old can get married---

1631
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:15,708
---but shouldn't wish
to have a child.

1632
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:17,167
Since the inception
of Aadhar card,

1633
01:23:17,208 --> 01:23:19,250
not just the age, even the
personal matters are public

1634
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:20,000
-Sir
-sir!

1635
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:21,625
-who's that?
-My name is Shakthi

1636
01:23:21,792 --> 01:23:23,083
I came to you
regarding a petition

1637
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:24,792
you guys use to come
to office and trouble

1638
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:25,500
now you're here too

1639
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,708
We were told you're
never in the office,

1640
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:27,333
who said that?

1641
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:28,667
I meant you will be
busy at the office,

1642
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,417
if we meet you outside, we can
have a better conversation.

1643
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:31,000
What's the issue?

1644
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,417
Linking the rivers in Poongoodi village,

1645
01:23:33,417 --> 01:23:34,250
It's us who are seeking it.

1646
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,917
Do you think linking
rivers is a Childs play?

1647
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:38,333
Don't be kidding.

1648
01:23:38,792 --> 01:23:40,792
Sir, I don't understand, I don't
see it that how this is funny

1649
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:42,583
If the next generation is
going to die due to scarcity

1650
01:23:42,625 --> 01:23:44,083
we will be stained
with that sin.

1651
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:45,875
In order to stop such mishap
we're struggling here.

1652
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:47,583
-What is this?
-Car!

1653
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,250
-Is it new?
-No it's old

1654
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,208
Was it on EMI or paid in full?

1655
01:23:51,208 --> 01:23:51,958
EMI!

1656
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,667
Oh-Oh!

1657
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:55,417
Sir, if you give us that
NOC, we can start our work

1658
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,792
We don't buy things on EMI,

1659
01:23:58,792 --> 01:24:00,875
as we're Govt. servants,
the payments reach home

1660
01:24:00,917 --> 01:24:02,042
Why would you take that effort.

1661
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:04,667
You will ignore even if someone
commits a suicide due to loans

1662
01:24:05,292 --> 01:24:06,542
what's the mileage?

1663
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:08,750
Sir, you're not listening
to what I'm saying

1664
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:10,083
what happened to that NOC?

1665
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:11,750
Listen, what you're seeking
is not a small thing,

1666
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:13,208
there are many formalities

1667
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:14,250
Please understand.

1668
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:15,583
Is the bike ready?

1669
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:17,917
That officer had mentioned,
they won't ask for it directly.

1670
01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:19,542
You did see what
he was expecting

1671
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:34,167
♪ Make a living working hard

1672
01:24:34,167 --> 01:24:37,083
♪ don't live on hard workers.

1673
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:40,917
Is this is a joke?

1674
01:24:41,083 --> 01:24:43,292
Sir, this is not a joke

1675
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,292
10 TMC of water from Poongoodi
river mixing into the sea,

1676
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:47,875
if that is diverted
to Kalyani river.

1677
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:50,208
1000 families will make a
living doing agriculture

1678
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:52,083
why are you so concerned
about their lives

1679
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,958
Why are we officers and
politician here for?

1680
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,958
The entire village knows
why you haven't done it.

1681
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,542
We don't want to waste
our time on that

1682
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,333
We will work for our needs

1683
01:25:00,417 --> 01:25:01,083
Ya right

1684
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:04,000
You guys are fooling yourselves
with digging tunnels and channels

1685
01:25:04,042 --> 01:25:05,708
also dragging the
village down with it.

1686
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:06,917
We're not the ones who
are dragging them down

1687
01:25:06,917 --> 01:25:08,250
we're not politicians
to do that.

1688
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:10,833
Our village requires
water for irrigation

1689
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:12,625
we can make that
happen ourselves

1690
01:25:12,792 --> 01:25:13,750
please help us with it.

1691
01:25:13,792 --> 01:25:15,917
Agriculture, Cows and Dung---

1692
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:17,250
---it's disgusting to ears.

1693
01:25:17,583 --> 01:25:19,375
I hail from a farmer's family

1694
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:21,208
these are useless sentiments

1695
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,500
and is a waste of time.

1696
01:25:22,792 --> 01:25:25,042
My grandmother took
a promise from me,

1697
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:27,000
asked me never to
comeback to agriculture

1698
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
'cause I'll be destroyed

1699
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,625
If someone talks ill
about agriculture

1700
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:31,792
punch them on their face. That's the
promise my grandmother took from me.

1701
01:25:31,917 --> 01:25:33,417
Isn't this pissing you off?

1702
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:34,792
Hey, shut up.

1703
01:25:34,792 --> 01:25:36,250
Ey...we're here to
seek permission---

1704
01:25:36,292 --> 01:25:38,042
---and he's talking about
his dead grandmother.

1705
01:25:38,542 --> 01:25:39,625
Sir, please Sir.

1706
01:25:39,917 --> 01:25:41,208
When someone is dying of hunger,

1707
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:43,375
it's a torture to their sight
when you throw away the food.

1708
01:25:43,417 --> 01:25:44,750
For God sake don't do that.

1709
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:47,042
1000 families can make a living.

1710
01:25:47,417 --> 01:25:50,292
And we're ready to invest
our money and work for it.

1711
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,167
Can you just grant us
permission to do it.

1712
01:25:52,208 --> 01:25:55,125
no matter what you say, I can't
permit public to work on their own

1713
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:57,000
If you want, file a petition

1714
01:25:57,042 --> 01:25:59,542
if everything is right, Govt.
will act on it.

1715
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,500
There's a procedure for everything.

1716
01:26:01,542 --> 01:26:03,625
Are you really following the procedure? And
giving a permit to the bars at wine shop.

1717
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:04,667
You've permitted
it, taking bribes.

1718
01:26:04,708 --> 01:26:06,792
We're trying something good
here, and you demand bribe

1719
01:26:06,792 --> 01:26:07,625
don't call yourself an officer.

1720
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:08,417
Mind your words

1721
01:26:08,417 --> 01:26:10,167
I'm talking to you damn
it, and it's the truth

1722
01:26:10,167 --> 01:26:12,500
Sir, can you or not?

1723
01:26:12,583 --> 01:26:13,417
Just tell us that

1724
01:26:13,458 --> 01:26:14,750
don't talk nonsense.

1725
01:26:14,792 --> 01:26:16,250
Didn't I ask you to
file a petition.

1726
01:26:16,292 --> 01:26:16,875
We'll take care of it.

1727
01:26:18,042 --> 01:26:18,875
Sure will take care of it.

1728
01:26:18,875 --> 01:26:20,292
-Sure!
-Sure!

1729
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:22,083
This won't work out

1730
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:23,500
They don't seem like rules

1731
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:25,417
they're mongrels in
the name of officers

1732
01:26:25,417 --> 01:26:28,000
Salary and Bonus, if they don't
get it, they go on a strike

1733
01:26:28,042 --> 01:26:29,625
on top of it they need bribe

1734
01:26:29,667 --> 01:26:30,125
Damn it!

1735
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:32,542
Losing is not something
new to our village

1736
01:26:32,542 --> 01:26:35,250
that doesn't mean we accept
defeat and lose hope.

1737
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:37,792
Hey...why are you
getting angry at me?

1738
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:39,792
They won't permit, even
after they're dead.

1739
01:26:39,917 --> 01:26:41,917
We will get it, I
will make it happen.

1740
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:46,583
Hey, come here.

1741
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:48,125
-Us?
-Yes you guys,

1742
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:48,792
come here.

1743
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:02,458
It's them Sir.

1744
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:05,917
Hey, Rajan.

1745
01:27:06,792 --> 01:27:08,625
-Do you know one thing
-Sir!

1746
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:12,417
These guys were working in
a IT company at Chennai

1747
01:27:12,667 --> 01:27:15,000
They were fired from that job.

1748
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:16,917
while they were wondering
what to do for living?

1749
01:27:16,917 --> 01:27:20,083
they thought of these
foolish village people.

1750
01:27:20,667 --> 01:27:24,333
This agriculture, water,
protests, hay etc---

1751
01:27:24,375 --> 01:27:26,375
---got he public confused

1752
01:27:26,417 --> 01:27:28,458
then swindle their funds

1753
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:31,458
and evade to foreign countries
like America and Australia.

1754
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:34,542
Isn't this your perfect plan?

1755
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:36,417
Buddy do you know one thing

1756
01:27:36,792 --> 01:27:38,083
Poongoodi water service

1757
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:38,958
Sir owns it

1758
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,792
there are 62 water tankers

1759
01:27:40,917 --> 01:27:42,458
if the village gets
access to good water

1760
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,917
Sir's water can business

1761
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:45,583
will go down the drain.

1762
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:51,375
Isn't this your
perfect plan, Sir?

1763
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:52,958
62 trucks is it?

1764
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:54,208
You're an inspector, right?

1765
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:56,625
You must earn around 50-60k?

1766
01:27:56,708 --> 01:27:58,917
Even we get paid the
same in IT companies

1767
01:27:59,167 --> 01:28:00,583
No matter how much we slog---

1768
01:28:00,625 --> 01:28:02,792
---we have multiple EMI's
taken from our accounts

1769
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,958
how is that you have
62 trucks running?

1770
01:28:05,542 --> 01:28:07,042
How many families you
must've destroyed.

1771
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:12,583
Ey...how dare you!

1772
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:14,042
Sir, Sir...don't hit me.

1773
01:28:14,083 --> 01:28:15,083
Sir don't

1774
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:15,750
Damn you!

1775
01:28:16,167 --> 01:28:17,333
Ey...Sir!

1776
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:19,042
Sir, don't hit me

1777
01:28:19,583 --> 01:28:20,875
Ey...don't hit me

1778
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:22,000
Trying to be smart with cops?

1779
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:23,875
Sir don't, please listen to me

1780
01:28:23,917 --> 01:28:25,125
hey...hey let me go.

1781
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:28,500
Sir, they're young
boys...please don't

1782
01:28:28,542 --> 01:28:30,750
-I know them personally
-Arrogance!

1783
01:28:31,292 --> 01:28:32,708
Sir, they're good guys

1784
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:33,958
don't you dare again

1785
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:37,500
What are you staring at?

1786
01:29:09,917 --> 01:29:10,917
Now shoot!

1787
01:29:11,792 --> 01:29:13,625
Can you manage to shoot
at least 6 people?

1788
01:29:14,667 --> 01:29:18,375
But the 7th one will burn you
to ashes right here right now.

1789
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:49,417
I thank each and everyone, who are
here to fight for their lives

1790
01:29:50,708 --> 01:29:52,583
we tried every possible venue

1791
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:53,917
we've tried knocking
on every door

1792
01:29:54,125 --> 01:29:55,292
No door was open to us

1793
01:29:55,542 --> 01:29:56,833
not even one soul respected us

1794
01:29:56,875 --> 01:29:59,042
This protest is to make
their heads turn.

1795
01:29:59,042 --> 01:30:01,583
To grab the attention of Govt.
and Govt. officers

1796
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:03,042
why should we burn
ourselves alive

1797
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:04,625
How many more lives
are we going to lose?

1798
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:06,333
We shouldn't lose anymore lives.

1799
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:07,958
Why did we elect them?

1800
01:30:08,417 --> 01:30:10,417
Is it just to link the Aadhar
card number to our mobile?

1801
01:30:10,792 --> 01:30:11,625
We're not asking too much

1802
01:30:11,708 --> 01:30:14,625
just to divert the excess water
towards the village, we'll use it.

1803
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:18,458
Our farmers were in
Delhi for 45 days---

1804
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,625
without any food or water

1805
01:30:19,708 --> 01:30:20,875
who cared about it?

1806
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:23,667
Their demands are still not met

1807
01:30:23,792 --> 01:30:25,625
but they're ignorant
about these things

1808
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:27,292
even without doing anything

1809
01:30:27,583 --> 01:30:30,167
they fancy us with a 1000 or
2000 rupees during elections

1810
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:31,542
We fake a smile a
and cast our votes

1811
01:30:31,708 --> 01:30:34,125
It's in our hands, for
not to repeat this.

1812
01:30:34,167 --> 01:30:35,667
Just 'cause the village
is in distress

1813
01:30:35,833 --> 01:30:37,958
instead of depending on
the men in our families

1814
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,625
each and every women
of our village

1815
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:42,667
are here with their infants
sitting under scorching sun.

1816
01:30:42,792 --> 01:30:44,458
This is our first victory.

1817
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:48,417
Video of a girl winking gets a
million hits in 10 minutes---

1818
01:30:48,917 --> 01:30:50,500
---but when the
agriculture is in despair

1819
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,125
no one seemed to bother.

1820
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:54,625
Agriculture is the back
bone of our nation---

1821
01:30:55,208 --> 01:30:59,292
---but that back bone has worn out
pleading to each and everyone

1822
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:02,000
All the rivers in India were about
to get linked for agriculture,

1823
01:31:02,042 --> 01:31:04,417
it's taking forever and
they've killed the notion.

1824
01:31:05,625 --> 01:31:08,875
This protest is to let us link
two rivers between the villages.

1825
01:31:09,625 --> 01:31:11,167
This is just the beginning

1826
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,625
-Shall we protest!?
-We will protest!

1827
01:31:13,625 --> 01:31:15,708
-Shall we protest!?
-We will protest!

1828
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:29,667
Greetings to one and all.

1829
01:31:29,708 --> 01:31:31,917
Don't worry, I'm here
for your troubles.

1830
01:31:31,917 --> 01:31:33,917
Hello brother, give me that.

1831
01:31:39,292 --> 01:31:41,500
Brother, this
protest of yours---

1832
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:45,000
---should be a victorious one,
my hearty wishes for that.

1833
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:47,083
Starting today, it's
not just your protest

1834
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:48,333
your protest---

1835
01:31:48,333 --> 01:31:51,708
---will have full support
of "KAKA-COCO" party.

1836
01:31:51,917 --> 01:31:53,375
Sir, thanks for coming

1837
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:56,042
but this is a protest
of our lives

1838
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:58,458
don't turn this into
a political motive.

1839
01:31:59,375 --> 01:32:01,583
Brother, it's a very
powerful party,

1840
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:02,667
Think about it.

1841
01:32:02,708 --> 01:32:03,500
You can leave Sir.

1842
01:32:04,167 --> 01:32:05,792
I said it's a powerful party.

1843
01:32:06,167 --> 01:32:06,833
Get lost from here.

1844
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:09,458
Crowd!?

1845
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:10,583
Bravery amidst the crowd?

1846
01:32:11,542 --> 01:32:13,292
It's an useless gathering
of the crowd.

1847
01:32:38,792 --> 01:32:39,917
Hey, Collector---

1848
01:32:40,417 --> 01:32:41,167
---get the hell out here

1849
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:42,375
brother please sit down

1850
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:45,000
Brother, you be quiet.
I'll take care of it.

1851
01:32:45,542 --> 01:32:46,583
Come out damn it.

1852
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:48,458
Brother please listen, sit down.

1853
01:32:48,542 --> 01:32:49,917
Hey Police get lost from here

1854
01:32:49,917 --> 01:32:50,750
Brother...brother

1855
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:51,458
get lost from here.

1856
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:53,542
Sir, he didn't mean to do that

1857
01:32:53,542 --> 01:32:54,583
Sir don't hit us

1858
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:56,250
Hey, how are you lay hands on me

1859
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:58,292
Sir, don't hit us

1860
01:32:58,583 --> 01:33:00,000
-Ey!
-Enough Sir

1861
01:33:00,042 --> 01:33:01,792
Hey....Hey!

1862
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:03,458
-Get lost!
-Oh no!

1863
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:09,333
Oh no!

1864
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:17,292
Oh no, let go.

1865
01:33:23,792 --> 01:33:25,042
Sir, don't hit me.

1866
01:33:47,417 --> 01:33:48,292
Sir---

1867
01:33:48,667 --> 01:33:49,417
---Sir!

1868
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:52,375
Sir, there are kids

1869
01:33:59,583 --> 01:34:01,000
Please don't hit us

1870
01:34:01,625 --> 01:34:02,542
Stop it

1871
01:34:02,917 --> 01:34:04,750
Idiots, stop it

1872
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:05,625
Stop it!

1873
01:34:05,792 --> 01:34:07,042
Don't hit the public.

1874
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:08,042
Stop it!

1875
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:10,667
Stop it!

1876
01:34:10,958 --> 01:34:11,792
Stop it!

1877
01:34:12,042 --> 01:34:12,917
Stop damn it!

1878
01:34:16,125 --> 01:34:18,958
Mr.Shakthi, what you're doing
here is public nuisance.

1879
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,083
First get that straight.

1880
01:34:20,083 --> 01:34:22,542
Facebook protestors like you---

1881
01:34:22,542 --> 01:34:24,917
---you're not aware of
practical difficulties.

1882
01:34:25,167 --> 01:34:27,250
This has become a fashion now.

1883
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:31,000
Huge gathering of public won't
fetch you any solution.

1884
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:34,875
Sir, don't take me wrong

1885
01:34:35,208 --> 01:34:37,417
we're not protesting
to while away time

1886
01:34:38,083 --> 01:34:39,750
We've done agriculture
for generations

1887
01:34:39,917 --> 01:34:41,500
we lived our lives sowing seeds

1888
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,042
if you ask them to
look for another job

1889
01:34:43,167 --> 01:34:44,250
How is that possible?

1890
01:34:44,375 --> 01:34:46,667
If he protests against it, you
call them public nuisance

1891
01:34:46,667 --> 01:34:49,500
It's you people, who has
brought them on streets

1892
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,375
there wasn't any issue until
it was a public protest

1893
01:34:52,417 --> 01:34:53,625
violence was infused into it.

1894
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:57,417
It all started when a lot
entered for their filthy gain.

1895
01:34:57,583 --> 01:34:59,375
If you can, why don't
you arrest them

1896
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:01,625
Before they infiltrate,
speak to us

1897
01:35:01,667 --> 01:35:03,917
Just with spades and crowbars

1898
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:05,125
we can't link rivers.

1899
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:06,375
We have to discuss to reach a solution.

1900
01:35:06,417 --> 01:35:10,000
Stale discussions like this has taken
50 years to even shut down a Decree.

1901
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,917
This project, without the
support of the Govt.---

1902
01:35:12,917 --> 01:35:14,458
without a ground plan

1903
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:17,542
we can't just proceed
with manpower.

1904
01:35:17,583 --> 01:35:20,750
Sir, was the big Temple of Thanjavur
was built with latest technology?

1905
01:35:21,417 --> 01:35:23,417
foreigners are going
crazy over it

1906
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:26,333
thinking how the 80 tonne stone was
taken all the way on top of the tower.

1907
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:28,042
We're not being hasty
in this situation

1908
01:35:28,042 --> 01:35:29,417
We have a presentation

1909
01:35:29,417 --> 01:35:31,292
just have a look at it once.

1910
01:35:48,542 --> 01:35:50,667
We got the permission!

01:41:24,917 --> 01:41:26,708
Shakti wants to say something.

1974
01:41:26,917 --> 01:41:29,500
Thanks for firing
us from that job.

1975
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:31,458
We're doing exactly what
we love at the moment.

1976
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:32,667
We're happy

1977
01:41:33,083 --> 01:41:34,458

01:41:35,208 --> 01:41:36,167
Do you have time?

Ok, go ahead

1981
01:41:37,042 --> 01:41:38,542
You're working 8 days a week---

1982
01:41:38,542 --> 01:41:39,958
---and you get drunk
on Saturday nights

1983
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,583
Then one day, just like
us you'll be sacked too

1984
01:41:42,625 --> 01:41:43,917
So, I have a better deal for you

1985
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:45,250
you can come to my village.

1986
01:41:45,333 --> 01:41:46,500
There are 8 cows

1987
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:48,250
we don't have someone
to throw out the dung

1988
01:41:48,292 --> 01:41:50,458
If you come, I'll pay you
a wage of 80 rupees/day.

1989
01:42:18,333 --> 01:42:19,625
Son, where were you
all these days?

1990
01:42:19,667 --> 01:42:20,833

1991
01:42:20,833 --> 01:42:22,708
you thought I was
just the man of word

1992
01:42:23,167 --> 01:42:25,250
I will be with you guys
until my last breath

1993
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:26,167

1994
01:42:26,167 --> 01:42:28,458
After everything is done, there
will be a inscription right!?

1995
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:30,542
Make sure my name is there,
history is important.

1996
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:32,833
Hey, just send a
email to Prithvi.

1997
01:42:33,042 --> 01:42:34,292

Please comeback to life

Shakthi!

2043
01:45:34,792 --> 01:45:36,208
Everything got buried into sand

2044
01:45:36,417 --> 01:45:37,833
Shakthi look at this mess

2045
01:45:39,083 --> 01:45:41,333
Shakthi look what has
happened to everyone

2046
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:42,583
Son---

2047
01:45:44,917 --> 01:45:47,583
Ey...look Shakthi is here

2048
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:48,583
Oh God!

2049
01:45:49,917 --> 01:45:51,375
Shakthi look at him---

2050
01:45:55,375 --> 01:45:56,125
Ey...!

2051
01:45:57,208 --> 01:45:58,500
Ey...Shanmugam!

2052
01:45:58,750 --> 01:45:59,458
Ey!

2053
01:46:03,375 --> 01:46:04,792
Look at this mess---

2054
01:46:04,833 --> 01:46:06,417
he has left us behind

2055
01:46:06,417 --> 01:46:07,375
Oh no!

2056
01:46:10,333 --> 01:46:11,250
Brother...!

2057
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:17,333
OH NO...!

2058
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:23,667
21 died in that landslide.

2059
01:46:24,792 --> 01:46:27,167
Shakthi felt guilty that
it was all his fault.

2060
01:46:29,042 --> 01:46:30,667
That was the last
time I saw Shakthi

2061
01:46:31,083 --> 01:46:32,167
I looked for him everywhere.

2062
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
No clue on the complaint
registered with Police.

2063
01:46:37,167 --> 01:46:40,042
But if his face was
donated to you---

2064
01:46:40,167 --> 01:46:42,708
---then Shakthi must've
met with an accident.

2065
01:46:43,417 --> 01:46:45,042
What happened with Shakthi
wasn't an accident.

2066
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:46,875
It was murder.

2067
01:46:51,625 --> 01:46:53,625
They're under the impression
that I'm Shakthi,

2068
01:46:53,958 --> 01:46:55,417
and are behind me.

2069
01:46:58,333 --> 01:47:00,542
I even inquired the person
who signed for my surgery

2070
01:47:01,292 --> 01:47:02,458
even she is not aware of him.

2071
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:03,500
Maya!

2072
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:05,167
From what you're saying---

2073
01:47:05,208 --> 01:47:07,167
---I suspect that Councilor
must be behind it

2074
01:47:07,625 --> 01:47:08,292
Not him---

2075
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,292
---he was killed in
a party scuffle.

2076
01:47:12,833 --> 01:47:14,458
He was angry with us

2077
01:47:14,792 --> 01:47:16,458
but not to the level
of killing Shakthi.

2078
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,917
Maya, if you don't mind---

2079
01:47:19,167 --> 01:47:22,333
can I see the details on the
river inter-linking project?

2080
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:34,000
This is Shakthi's laptop

2081
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:35,875
all details are stored in it

2082
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:37,708
but the password---

2083
01:47:37,708 --> 01:47:38,708
---I don't know the password

2084
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:40,750
Shall I give it a try?

2085
01:47:53,375 --> 01:47:54,125
Shiva!

2086
01:47:54,875 --> 01:47:56,958
This has face recognition option

2087
01:48:18,583 --> 01:48:19,042
Hey!

2088
01:48:24,875 --> 01:48:27,458
I went through the details about
the river linking project.

2089
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:28,292
Really amazing!

2090
01:48:28,292 --> 01:48:29,750
In order to progress
our nation's GDP

2091
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:32,500
all the rivers in India should be
link and agriculture should develop.

2092
01:48:32,583 --> 01:48:34,125
In order to help
executing this project,

2093
01:48:34,125 --> 01:48:37,292
from our US Tamil LLC
I'm sending $50,000

2094
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:39,250
Tiny contribution
to our homeland.

2095
01:48:40,875 --> 01:48:43,167
Look here, it's 10 TMC of water

2096
01:48:43,167 --> 01:48:45,083
It's going vain into the sea.

2097
01:48:45,125 --> 01:48:46,458
In order to get this
into our village

2098
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:48,875
and develop agriculture,
Shakthi is struggling for us.

2099
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:52,500
You people never liked the
fact, if farmers are happy.

2100
01:48:52,708 --> 01:48:53,917
No matter what happens,

2101
01:48:53,917 --> 01:48:56,500
we will make sure to link
this water to Kalyani river

2102
01:48:56,917 --> 01:49:00,833
Share this as much as possible, so
it will reach all the officials.

2103
01:49:06,542 --> 01:49:08,708
Maya, isn't this your email-id?

2104
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:10,333
That's right, it's my id.

2105
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:11,958
But it's not delivered.

2106
01:49:12,292 --> 01:49:14,667
He was trying to send
an email on June 5th.

2107
01:49:14,917 --> 01:49:17,583
due to wrong email address,
it wasn't delivered.

2108
01:49:18,125 --> 01:49:19,042
Open it.

2109
01:49:25,875 --> 01:49:26,875
Maya!

2110
01:49:34,292 --> 01:49:35,125
Maya!

2111
01:49:36,792 --> 01:49:39,958
I'm not sure, I'll
be alive tomorrow

2112
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,333
but you have to know the truth.

2113
01:49:53,125 --> 01:49:53,917
Shakthi!?

2114
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:56,167
How come you're here?

2115
01:49:56,167 --> 01:49:58,333
21 people who died
in that land slide

2116
01:49:58,333 --> 01:50:00,625
they're stating you're the reason for
it and there's an FIR against you.

2117
01:50:01,125 --> 01:50:02,292
You better leave from here.

2118
01:50:04,542 --> 01:50:05,167
Sir---

2119
01:50:06,208 --> 01:50:07,583
It was in Shanmugam's hand

2120
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:28,583
This wasn't a landslide.

2121
01:50:29,458 --> 01:50:31,458
It was pre-planned set up

2122
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:32,500
Bomb!

2123
01:50:32,958 --> 01:50:34,333
We shouldn't let this go.

2124
01:50:34,917 --> 01:50:36,208
Let's go to the
commissioner right away.

2125
01:50:36,375 --> 01:50:37,542
Also will inform the media.

2126
01:50:37,542 --> 01:50:38,750
moreover the people
of our village

2127
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:40,458
Ok, don't panic

2128
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:41,875
this has to be handled
in the right way

2129
01:50:41,917 --> 01:50:43,542
First I have to inform the AC,

2130
01:50:43,583 --> 01:50:45,292
wait for a minute,
I'll get my phone

2131
01:50:53,667 --> 01:50:54,542
Just a minute

2132
01:50:57,292 --> 01:50:59,458
Hello! Sir good evening.

2133
01:51:00,125 --> 01:51:02,250
Yes Sir, Shakthi is right here.

2134
01:51:02,458 --> 01:51:03,500
He's a good person.

2135
01:51:03,542 --> 01:51:04,958
It's not his fault.

2136
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,542
I'll bring him in 10 mins.

2137
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:07,750
Ok Sir!

2138
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,083
Ok Sir, thank you...thank you.

2139
01:51:11,375 --> 01:51:12,375
I'll get ready

2140
01:51:12,417 --> 01:51:13,333
wait for a moment.

2141
01:52:10,042 --> 01:52:11,458
There is no agriculture
here, Sir.

2142
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,000
It's an empty land.

2143
01:52:13,125 --> 01:52:15,042
It will show clearly
in your camera.

2144
01:52:15,167 --> 01:52:17,375
The people of this
village are fools.

2145
01:52:17,375 --> 01:52:18,750
we can take it from them easily.

2146
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:20,958
But my commission is 5%.

2147
01:52:20,958 --> 01:52:22,125
Do you understand, Sir?

2148
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:24,083
"If someone harms you"

2149
01:52:24,167 --> 01:52:26,458
"Do good unto them"

2150
01:52:26,625 --> 01:52:27,167
Ok!?

2151
01:52:27,208 --> 01:52:28,292
Wow!

2152
01:52:28,333 --> 01:52:31,333
Beautifully spoken,
Thiruvalluar will be happy.

2153
01:52:31,375 --> 01:52:34,875
We've taken a lot of money from
you, shouldn't be asking this

2154
01:52:34,875 --> 01:52:36,458
still can't help it

2155
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,792
you've extracted
enough gas already

2156
01:52:38,792 --> 01:52:40,583
what is left to extract now?

2157
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,708
We've contributed enough
to the gas industry

2158
01:52:44,375 --> 01:52:45,375
this is something else.

2159
01:52:45,958 --> 01:52:48,042
"Private Electricity"

2160
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,750
You've taken care of
electricity for long

2161
01:52:52,917 --> 01:52:57,083
we'll share half the
responsibility of your Govt.

2162
01:52:58,542 --> 01:53:00,250
You've privatized buses

2163
01:53:00,667 --> 01:53:02,292
Banks are privatized

2164
01:53:02,292 --> 01:53:04,083
You didn't spare the
Education system too

2165
01:53:04,125 --> 01:53:07,500
Only the water you've
paid for is pure,

2166
01:53:07,542 --> 01:53:09,833
water which is available for
free, will cause disease

2167
01:53:09,875 --> 01:53:11,000
you people privatized
that as well.

2168
01:53:11,042 --> 01:53:12,958
And when it came to telephones
in the name of "Tels"

2169
01:53:12,958 --> 01:53:14,792
you guys privatized that as well.

2170
01:53:14,833 --> 01:53:17,583
Now you're turning electricity
into private sector

2171
01:53:17,625 --> 01:53:18,583
what's next!?

2172
01:53:19,875 --> 01:53:20,500
Trains!?

2173
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:22,917
Oh! So that's in pipeline too

2174
01:53:22,958 --> 01:53:25,250
We're investing 500
crores in this project

2175
01:53:25,667 --> 01:53:28,833
and have decided to rake in profits
up to 2000 crores, that's EDICOS's plan.

2176
01:53:28,917 --> 01:53:30,917
The only goal of a
businessman is---

2177
01:53:31,792 --> 01:53:32,792
---Profits!

2178
01:53:32,833 --> 01:53:35,292
So, there will be no empathy.

2179
01:53:48,792 --> 01:53:50,500
When someone is not selfish,

2180
01:53:50,708 --> 01:53:52,125
cares about everyone

2181
01:53:52,292 --> 01:53:54,292
and when he gets
down to help them.

2182
01:53:54,417 --> 01:53:58,458
In the end he gets defeated
by slimy dogs like you.

2183
01:53:58,500 --> 01:53:59,417
You're right Shakthi

2184
01:53:59,917 --> 01:54:03,333
how many can I keep killing
in the name of money

2185
01:54:03,375 --> 01:54:05,167
You didn't lose to me at the end

2186
01:54:05,167 --> 01:54:06,917
it's me who has been
giving you a run around.

2187
01:54:07,042 --> 01:54:09,917
When this project begun, you
came with the river linking plan

2188
01:54:10,125 --> 01:54:12,250
convinced and confused the
people with agriculture

2189
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:14,375
and lead them not to
sell their lands.

2190
01:54:14,375 --> 01:54:15,458
If we achieve this

2191
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,333
our village agriculture won't
be dependent on rains.

2192
01:54:17,625 --> 01:54:21,250
Through the same company
which fired you

2193
01:54:21,625 --> 01:54:23,417
I planned to send you America.

2194
01:54:23,542 --> 01:54:24,833
We're hiring you guys back

2195
01:54:24,875 --> 01:54:26,625
Thanks for firing
us from that job.

2196
01:54:26,667 --> 01:54:28,500
we love what we're
doing at the moment.

2197
01:54:28,542 --> 01:54:29,542
And that Councilor---

2198
01:54:29,917 --> 01:54:32,167
---for making him win
all the elections

2199
01:54:32,375 --> 01:54:34,583
was useful to me for
the first time.

2200
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:37,250
Instead sell it all to me

2201
01:54:37,375 --> 01:54:39,500
and be happy with the money
it will fetch you guys.

2202
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:44,292
Do you remember getting
arrested for no reason?

2203
01:54:45,667 --> 01:54:48,125
But still you managed to gather
the public and protested

2204
01:54:48,417 --> 01:54:50,375
also got permission
from the Collector.

2205
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:51,917
-Shall we protest?
-We will protest!

2206
01:54:51,917 --> 01:54:54,000
-Shall we protest?
-We will protest!

2207
01:54:54,042 --> 01:54:56,167
So I sent two of my
men into the crowd

2208
01:55:00,167 --> 01:55:02,167
You got the permission
from the collector

2209
01:55:03,167 --> 01:55:04,375
I was left with no choice

2210
01:55:04,833 --> 01:55:07,833
I planned to use the same pit,
you people dug as their graves.

2211
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:15,417
Man-made Landslide!

2212
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,875
For public it seemed like
a natural Landslide.

2213
01:55:17,917 --> 01:55:20,167
But it was my set up all along.

2214
01:55:20,167 --> 01:55:22,167
This is still not the vital plan

2215
01:55:22,958 --> 01:55:24,292
the reason for the death toll

2216
01:55:24,583 --> 01:55:27,792
I wanted to frame you for that.

2217
01:55:28,667 --> 01:55:31,500
But your friend sniffed out
something before his death

2218
01:55:31,625 --> 01:55:32,167
right!?

2219
01:55:39,458 --> 01:55:43,167
Air and water, the gifts of nature. You guys
have made it impossible to even enjoy them

2220
01:55:43,917 --> 01:55:46,042
In the name of capitalism
and survival of the fittest

2221
01:55:46,083 --> 01:55:47,833
you just look after yourself.

2222
01:55:50,542 --> 01:55:52,667
Just for your gain---

2223
01:55:52,958 --> 01:55:54,250
---21 lives!

2224
01:55:54,333 --> 01:55:57,083
There are many lives on this earth

2225
01:55:58,167 --> 01:55:59,583
just like the worms.

2226
01:55:59,833 --> 01:56:01,292
But when you build a factory

2227
01:56:01,292 --> 01:56:03,208
or you're digging a
hole, they tend to die.

2228
01:56:03,833 --> 01:56:06,792
To me it was 21
worms which died.

2229
01:56:07,625 --> 01:56:09,583
Now another worm
is about to die.

2230
01:56:58,458 --> 01:56:59,042
Hey!

2231
01:57:00,458 --> 01:57:02,125
Do you peck yourself for a
big revolutionary leader,

2232
01:57:03,417 --> 01:57:04,667
what are you going to do now?

2233
01:57:06,583 --> 01:57:07,083
Ey!

2234
01:57:08,083 --> 01:57:08,625
Hey!

2235
01:57:12,083 --> 01:57:13,083
Shakthi!

2236
01:58:20,542 --> 01:58:22,125
Die damn it!

2237
01:59:26,583 --> 01:59:28,000
Ah...Shit!

2238
02:00:02,958 --> 02:00:03,917
Maya!

2239
02:00:05,667 --> 02:00:09,250
I'm not sure if I'll
be alive tomorrow

2240
02:00:10,167 --> 02:00:12,042
But you need to know the
truth about few things---

2241
02:00:25,125 --> 02:00:27,417
Hey Muruga, who is this?

2242
02:00:27,458 --> 02:00:29,458
no idea, when did
get on the truck?

2243
02:00:32,083 --> 02:00:34,167
Fine, let's leave
before someone sees us.

2244
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:44,000
Can you please open your eyes?

2245
02:00:46,333 --> 02:00:47,708
What was our fault?

2246
02:00:49,417 --> 02:00:51,667
Our village, and for
our agriculture

2247
02:00:51,958 --> 02:00:54,000
water...we were
trying get water.

2248
02:00:54,292 --> 02:00:55,667
a bomb was planted instead.

2249
02:00:56,667 --> 02:00:58,625
21 lives were buried alive

2250
02:00:59,208 --> 02:00:59,875
and killed.

2251
02:01:01,167 --> 02:01:02,417
On top of it, Shakthi too

2252
02:01:04,292 --> 02:01:06,292
only people of this
stature can survive?

2253
02:01:37,417 --> 02:01:38,917
Sir...Sir!

2254
02:01:44,042 --> 02:01:44,667
Sir!

2255
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:10,375
When I saw you panic
in order to save me---

2256
02:02:11,792 --> 02:02:13,583
---I understood that
you're not him.

2257
02:02:15,083 --> 02:02:16,375
-You...!?
-Sir!

2258
02:02:17,125 --> 02:02:19,083
-You!?
-Don't close your eyes, look at me.

2259
02:02:19,375 --> 02:02:20,500
look at me, Sir.

2260
02:02:21,333 --> 02:02:22,000
Sir!

2261
02:02:22,667 --> 02:02:26,583
I collected information
pertaining to you

2262
02:02:28,708 --> 02:02:33,042
Hereafter my men
won't trouble you.

2263
02:02:34,417 --> 02:02:35,083
Leave!

2264
02:02:37,417 --> 02:02:38,792
Suraj is your name right!?

2265
02:02:41,333 --> 02:02:45,292
If the power plant project for private
electricity didn't take off---

2266
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
---you would've been
on streets begging

2267
02:02:50,917 --> 02:02:53,750
destroying the people of the
village and their agriculture

2268
02:02:53,833 --> 02:02:56,542
it's not necessary for you to make
a living out of their misery.

2269
02:02:57,667 --> 02:02:58,125
Hey!

2270
02:02:59,667 --> 02:03:04,667
But for your gain, you've
killed 22 people, without mercy

2271
02:03:07,167 --> 02:03:08,375
how do you know so much?

2272
02:03:09,333 --> 02:03:10,750
I thought you're not Shakthi.

2273
02:03:12,333 --> 02:03:13,875
So what If I'm not Shakthi---

2274
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,833
---that doesn’t justify
you're right.

2275
02:03:18,917 --> 02:03:20,208
Police - 1 Lac

2276
02:03:20,708 --> 02:03:22,167
PWD officer - 3 Lacs

2277
02:03:22,167 --> 02:03:23,750
and Councilor - 10 Lacs

2278
02:03:24,417 --> 02:03:26,750
Just for the sake of money

2279
02:03:26,750 --> 02:03:29,750
they came behind you wagging
their tail like dogs.

2280
02:03:30,208 --> 02:03:31,458
But Shakthi---

2281
02:03:31,792 --> 02:03:32,958
---don't know he was

2282
02:03:33,333 --> 02:03:35,958
He gave me a new
life with a new face

2283
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,500
What can I do for him?

2284
02:03:42,958 --> 02:03:44,292
Shiva, I've read in a novel

2285
02:03:44,333 --> 02:03:47,917
If Epidefrine is induced into
someone's body in abundance

2286
02:03:47,917 --> 02:03:49,667
will die of excess  adrenaline.

2287
02:03:57,625 --> 02:03:59,500
Are you struggling to breathe?

2288
02:04:00,083 --> 02:04:02,417
I've increased the level
of adrenaline in your body

2289
02:04:02,667 --> 02:04:04,250
you're going to die
of suffocation.

2290
02:04:06,167 --> 02:04:07,792
It can't be traced
even in post-mortem.

2291
02:04:10,917 --> 02:04:11,917
Life is a Bi---

2292
02:04:18,333 --> 02:04:19,875
Life is a Boomerang!

2293
02:05:29,917 --> 02:05:34,625
♪ when the source of the
life goes through agony

2294
02:05:34,667 --> 02:05:38,625
♪ life gives way to it.

2295
02:05:39,917 --> 02:05:44,625
♪ Even if you're
sown like a seed,

2296
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:50,458

air will embrace you.

2297
02:05:50,708 --> 02:06:00,583
♪ The future will take
a shape from the fire

2298
02:06:01,292 --> 02:06:06,000
