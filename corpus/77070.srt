00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:22,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574

6
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:33,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Is he supposed
to be crying like this?

7
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:35,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
May l?

00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:51,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can I have him back?

9
00:01:56,207 --> 00:01:58,402  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What happened during the delivery?

10
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:01,047  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Nothing.
It was very quick.

11
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:03,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The babyjust wanted
to come right out.

12
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:05,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And there were no problems.

13
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:09,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Did you drop him?

14
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:11,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What?

15
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:13,603  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574

16
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:15,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Jesus Christ, no.

17
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:23,445  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Inform the ambulance

20
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:35,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It appears that your baby

21
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
while inside your uterus.

22
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
His arms and his legs are broken.

27
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:59,683  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574

29
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Could I take a look at that one?

33
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:21,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you looking for any
male synchronized swimmers?

34
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:24,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I'm thinking about getting into that.

35
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:29,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm afraid ofwater.

36
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:31,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Think that's a problem?

37
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:41,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You represent someone

from Temple University.

39
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:45,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574

41
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:53,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He runs a 40 in 4.3 seconds.
He's gonna be a god.

No.

83
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:32,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where were you sitting
on the train?

84
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:38,686  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Against the window.
- In the passenger car?

85
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah.

86
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:48,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Where are the other passengers?
- Was your family travelling with you?

87
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:52,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

88
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:55,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Did you get up from your seat?

89
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you certain
you were in the passenger car?

90
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes.

91
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:20,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why are you looking at me like that?

92
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:22,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your train derailed.

93
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:25,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Some kind of malfunction.

94
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:28,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They only found
two people alive so far--

95
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
you and this man.

96
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:35,964  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
His skull was cracked open and
most of his left side was crushed.

97
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:40,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And to answeryour question,
there are two reasons...

98
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
why I'm looking at you like this.

99
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
One, because it seems
in a few minutes...

100
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:50,045  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that you will offiîcially be
the only survivor ofthis train wreck.

101
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,925  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And two...

102
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:54,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
because you didn't break one bone.

103
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You don't have a scratch on you.

104
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:41,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
David?

105
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:48,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What happened in New York?

106
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:52,162  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't think I got thejob.

107
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:56,964  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm still going to, uh--

108
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:59,686  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm still moving there.

109
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:01,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Just--

110
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Uh, just-just not now.

111
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:11,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good night.

00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:46,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We pray foryour soul.

119
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Glen Stevens...

122
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:58,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We pray foryour soul.

123
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:02,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Jennifer Pennyman...

atJefferson Elementary.

125
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:10,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We pray foryour soul.

126
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:18,004  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Yes?
- Is Noel in, ma'am?

127
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:19,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, sir, he is not.

128
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:24,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I read about you in the paper.

129
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What?
- I was in an accident once too.

130
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:30,245  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A horse almost trampled me to death.

131
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:32,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Wow.
- Had him put down.

132
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's a sad story.

133
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:44,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Could-- Could you ask Noel
something for me, please?

134
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Proceed.

135
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:48,403  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Would you ask him to check
how many sick days I've taken...

136
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:50,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
since I've worked here?

137
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- That the entire message?
- Yes, ma'am.

138
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:59,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thankyou.

139
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:37,445  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, Noel.

140
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:39,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What, you hit your head on that train?

141
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get your brain
to start working again?

142
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What?
- Forty dollars.

143
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:49,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Forty dollars what?
- You're gettin' a $40-a-week raise.

144
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:51,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's it.

145
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:56,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I checked. You were right.
You've never taken a sick day.

146
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:59,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Five years, no sick day.
I get it. You want a raise.

147
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Smart way to make your point.

148
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:29,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- IsJoseph okay?
- Yeah.

149
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:32,321  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- He's asleep.
- Oh.

150
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:39,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I wanted to askyou a question.

151
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:41,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's gonna sound a little strange,
but, uh...

152
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:44,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
just think about it
for a second, okay?

153
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:46,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Okay.

154
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:49,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When's the last time I was sick?

155
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:51,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you remember?

156
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:56,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Um, l-l don't know.

157
00:18:58,407 --> 00:19:01,126  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's been a while.

158
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I haven't been sick this year,
I know that.

159
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:06,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Okay.

160
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:08,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you remember me gettin' sick?

161
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:14,202  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Um...

162
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
not a specifiîc day.

163
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,683  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And what's-what's this about?

164
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:24,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Audrey, do you remember me
ever getting sick?

165
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:27,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
In the three years
we lived in this house?

166
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
In the old apartment?

167
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:32,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
BeforeJoseph was born?
Before we ever got married?

168
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:38,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I-l can't remember.

169
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:42,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't you think
that's kind ofweird...

170
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:46,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
not remembering one cold
or a-a fever or a sore throat?

171
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What do you think it means?

172
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,805  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Um...

173
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:01,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think it means
I'm probably too tired to remember.

174
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:45,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No more sittin' in this room.
I let it go on long enough.

175
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:48,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm not goin' out there any more.
I'm not getting hurt again.

176
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:52,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- This was the last time, I told you.
- You can't do anything about that.

177
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:55,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You might fall between
this chair and that television.

178
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ifthat's what God has planned foryou,
that's what's gonna happen.

179
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:00,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You can't hide from it
sittin' in a room.

180
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:08,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They call me Mr Glass at school
because I break like glass.

181
00:21:13,047 --> 00:21:14,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You make this decision now...

182
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:18,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
to be afraid...

183
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:21,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and you will never turn back.

184
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:28,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your whole life,
you will always be afraid.

185
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,801  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I got a present foryou.
- Why?

186
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:48,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Forget why.

187
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:52,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You want it or not?

188
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,723  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, go get it, then.

189
00:21:57,807 --> 00:22:00,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where is it?

190
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:03,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
On a bench...

191
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:05,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
across the street.

192
00:22:18,727 --> 00:22:20,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Someone's gonna take it.

193
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:25,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Then you better get out there soon.

194
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:38,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I bought a whole bunch.

195
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:44,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There'll be one ofthese
waitin' foryou...

196
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:46,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
every time you want
to come out here.

197
00:23:53,447 --> 00:23:56,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They say this one
has a surprise ending.

198
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:07,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is from Fritz Campion's
own library.

199
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:12,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is before the fiîrst issue of
the comic book hit the stands in 1 968.

200
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:16,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's a classic depiction
of good versus evil.

201
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:20,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Notice the squarejaw ofSlayer,
common in most comic heroes.

202
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:24,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And the slightly disproportionate size
ofJaguaro's head to his body.

203
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:28,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This again is common,
but only in villains.

204
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:30,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The thing to notice about this piece...

205
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:34,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
the thing that makes it
very, very special...

206
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:37,605  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
is its realistic depiction
of its fiîgures.

207
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:39,643  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When the characters
reached the magazine...

208
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:41,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
they were exaggerated...

209
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:43,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
as always happens.

210
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:47,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is vintage.

211
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well...

212
00:24:57,207 --> 00:24:59,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
wrap it up.

213
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:01,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You've made a considerably
wise decision.

214
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:09,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, my kid's gonna go berserk.

215
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:14,483  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Once again, please?

216
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:17,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My sonJeb--
it's a gift for him.

217
00:25:17,327 --> 00:25:20,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How old isJeb?
- He's four.

218
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:24,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

219
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:28,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, no, no, no, no.

220
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:32,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You need to go. Now.

221
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:36,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What'd-What'd I say?

222
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:39,404  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you see any Teletubbies in here?

223
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:41,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you see a slender plastic tag
clipped to my shirt...

224
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:43,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
with my name printed on it?

225
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:46,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Did you see a little Asian child with
a blank expression sitting outside...

226
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:50,162  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
in a mechanical helicopter that shakes
when you put quarters in it?

227
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:53,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No? Well, that's what
you see at a toy store...

228
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:55,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and you must think
you're in a toy store because...

229
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:59,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
you're here shopping
for an infant named Jeb.

230
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:02,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now, one of us
has made a gross error...

231
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:05,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and wasted the other person's
valuable time.

232
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:07,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is an art gallery,
my friend...

233
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:11,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and this is a piece ofart.

234
00:26:25,847 --> 00:26:27,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're by appointment only.

235
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:31,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I got a card from this store.
- Congratulations.

236
00:26:32,047 --> 00:26:35,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You have a mailbox.
The exhibition isn't for two weeks.

237
00:26:35,607 --> 00:26:38,326  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This one was under
the windshield wiper of my car.

238
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:44,045  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How certain are you that
you've never taken ill?

239
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:46,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Seventy-fiîve percent.

240
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, that's not
certain at all, is it?

241
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:54,125  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's hole number one.

242
00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:57,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm going to be extremely skeptical
about all this.

243
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
About all what?

244
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:03,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm assuming you've never been injured.
Would I be wrong in that assumption?

245
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:05,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Dad's been injured.

246
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:09,925  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Is the child correct?

247
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:13,966  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, sir. In college,
I was in a car accident.

248
00:27:14,047 --> 00:27:18,723  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Was it serious?
- He couldn't play football any more.

249
00:27:18,807 --> 00:27:20,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's hole number two.

250
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:24,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's a big one.

251
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:31,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mr Price, can we talk about
the note that you left on my car?

252
00:27:31,687 --> 00:27:34,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've studied the form
ofcomics intimately.

253
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've spent a third of my life
in a hospital bed...

254
00:27:36,927 --> 00:27:39,964  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
with nothing else to do but read.

255
00:27:40,047 --> 00:27:41,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I believe comics
are our last link...

256
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:45,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
to an ancient way
of passing on history.

257
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:47,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The Egyptians drew on walls.

258
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:51,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Countries all over the world still pass
on knowledge through pictorial forms.

259
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:54,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I believe comics
are a form of history...

260
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:57,603  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that someone somewhere
felt or experienced.

261
00:27:57,687 --> 00:27:59,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Then, ofcourse,
those experiences and that history...

262
00:28:00,007 --> 00:28:02,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
got chewed up in the commercial
machine, gotjazzed up...

263
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:05,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
made titillating,
cartooned for the sale rack.

264
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:10,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This city has seen its share
ofdisasters.

265
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:12,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I watched the aftermath
ofthat plane crash.

266
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:15,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I watched the carnage
ofthe hotel fiîre.

267
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:20,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I watched the news waiting to hear
a very specifiîc combination ofwords...

268
00:28:20,247 --> 00:28:22,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but they never came.

269
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:26,322  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Then one day I saw a news story
about a train accident...

270
00:28:26,407 --> 00:28:28,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and I heard them.

271
00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:30,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"There is a sole survivor...

272
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:33,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and he is miraculously unharmed."

273
00:28:36,407 --> 00:28:39,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I have something called
osteogenesis imperfecta.

274
00:28:39,807 --> 00:28:41,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's a genetic disorder.

275
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:43,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't make a particular
protein very well...

276
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:46,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and it makes my bones
very low in density.

277
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:48,522  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Very easy to break.

278
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:51,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've had 54 breaks in my life...

279
00:28:51,127 --> 00:28:55,723  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and I have the tamest version
ofthis disorder, type one.

280
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:59,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There are type two,
type three, type four.

281
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Type fours don't last very long.

282
00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:05,805  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So that's how it popped into my head.

283
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:08,606  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ifthere is someone
like me in the world...

284
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:10,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and I'm at one end
ofthe spectrum...

285
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:12,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
couldn't there be someone else...

286
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:15,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
the opposite of me
at the other end?

287
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:19,405  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Someone who doesn't get sick, who
doesn't get hurt like the rest of us?

288
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:23,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And he probably
doesn't even know it.

289
00:29:23,207 --> 00:29:28,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The kind of person
these stories are about.

290
00:29:28,287 --> 00:29:33,202  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A person put here
to protect the rest of us.

291
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:35,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To guard us.

292
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:41,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You think my dad's a real--
- I don't think anything right now.

293
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:44,442  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's a possibility--

294
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:46,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
one with many holes.

295
00:29:49,847 --> 00:29:52,407  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joseph, don't take
another sip ofthat water.

296
00:29:55,447 --> 00:29:57,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Go throw it in the trash.
- But Dad--

297
00:29:57,527 --> 00:29:59,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do it now, please.

298
00:30:08,687 --> 00:30:12,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I see guys like you
all the time in my work.

299
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:15,603  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You fiînd someone you want
to take advantage of...

300
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:18,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
you tell them a fantastic story...

301
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:21,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and somewhere in there you say it:

302
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:24,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"I just need
your credit card number...

303
00:30:24,847 --> 00:30:26,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
a small down payment."

304
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This morning was the fiîrst morning
that I could remember...

305
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:33,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that I didn't open my eyes
and feel...

306
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,003  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
sadness.

307
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:44,484  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I thought the person that wrote
that note had an answer for me.

308
00:30:51,127 --> 00:30:54,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm gonna leave now.

309
00:30:54,127 --> 00:30:56,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good luck with your exhibition.

310
00:30:56,127 --> 00:30:58,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So, what kind ofjob
do you have, David?

311
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You said you've met guys like me
in your work.

312
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:05,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What exactly is it that you do?
- I work at the University Stadium.

313
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:07,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm a security guard.

314
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:19,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hi.

315
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:22,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've come to a decision.

316
00:33:22,727 --> 00:33:25,002  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Okay.

317
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I just wanna askyou something, okay?

318
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:30,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And you can be totally honest.

319
00:33:31,087 --> 00:33:34,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm prepared for any answer,
and-and it won't affect me.

320
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:39,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Have you been with anyone?

321
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:41,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I mean, since we've
been having problems.

322
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:43,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The answer won't affect me.

323
00:33:47,047 --> 00:33:49,607  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I just need to know, you know?

324
00:33:49,687 --> 00:33:51,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I mean, it won't affect me
either way.

325
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:55,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

326
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:05,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sorry, David.
I'm sorry.

327
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:12,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Anyway...

328
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:14,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
my decision is...

329
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that I want to start again.

330
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:25,886  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I want it to be
like it was in the beginning.

331
00:34:29,127 --> 00:34:32,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And it's a big deal that
you walked away from that train.

332
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:37,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I feel like it's a second chance.

333
00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:46,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And ifyou feel like
asking me out sometime...

334
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:48,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that'd be okay.

335
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Okay.

336
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:07,081  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Dunn.
- Go for Dunn.

337
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:11,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah, it'sJenkins. Look, wegot aguy
overatgate 17-C with a bogus ticket.

338
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:15,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sayshe knowsyou.
He won't tellme hisname.

339
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:17,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's he look like?

340
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:20,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why is it, do you think, that
ofall the professions in the world...

341
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:22,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
you chose protection?

342
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:26,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You are a very strange man.
- You could have been a tax accountant.

343
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:29,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You could have owned your own gym. You
could've opened a chain of restaurants.

344
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You could've done
one of 1 0,000 things.

345
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:36,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But in the end,
you chose to protect people.

346
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You made that decision,
and I fiînd that...

347
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:40,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
very, very interesting.

348
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,605  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now all I need is
your credit card number.

349
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:47,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That last part was a joke.

350
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:55,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You're a big sports fan, are you?
- It's starting to intrigue me.

351
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:59,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It gets heaviest
ten minutes before kickoff.

352
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,562  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Programme here.
Programme.

353
00:36:13,647 --> 00:36:15,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Programme.

354
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:20,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Programme. Programme here.

355
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:22,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Rich, why don't we pat down?
- Right.

356
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:24,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
-Just give me a minute.
- Is there a problem?

357
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:26,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to search you.

358
00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:30,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- It's nothing personal.
- The tall guy in the camouflagejacket.

359
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:34,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sometimes people carry weapons in here,
and they drink too much.

360
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:39,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ifthe team's not doing good,
bad things can happen.

361
00:36:39,327 --> 00:36:42,444  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We do pat-downs ofthe crowd
to discourage people from carrying.

362
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:46,321  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If he's carrying,
he'll step out of line.

363
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:00,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah, step right up here.

364
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:14,203  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Okay. I got you a seat up
in the yellow section.

365
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:18,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's in the nosebleeds,
but at least you won't get spit on.

366
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:21,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- All right.
- How'd you know that guy you bumped...

367
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:23,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
was carrying a weapon?

368
00:37:25,207 --> 00:37:27,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't know.

369
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:31,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Maybe it was that camouflage
armyjacket he was wearing.

370
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:34,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Those guys like to carry
hunting knives and stuff for show.

371
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:37,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You thought he was carrying a knife?

372
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:40,765  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I thought he was carrying
something, yeah.
- But not a knife.

373
00:37:44,247 --> 00:37:49,002  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I got a picture ofa silver gun
with a black grip...

374
00:37:49,087 --> 00:37:51,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
tucked in his pants.

375
00:37:51,327 --> 00:37:53,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know, like on TV.

376
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:57,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You have good instincts
for things like that?

377
00:37:57,807 --> 00:38:01,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Like what?
- Knowing when people
have done something wrong?

378
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:07,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Yeah.
- Have you ever tried to develop it?

379
00:38:09,327 --> 00:38:13,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I don't know what you're asking me.
- Your skill.

380
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:15,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look, I gotta be down on
the sidelines during the game.

381
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:17,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You can get to your seat right down--
- Characters in comics...

382
00:38:17,727 --> 00:38:20,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
are often attributed special powers--

383
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:24,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
invisibility, X-ray vision,
things ofthat sort.

384
00:38:24,567 --> 00:38:27,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Okay.

385
00:38:27,127 --> 00:38:31,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I don't wanna play this game any more.
- It's an exaggeration ofthe truth.

386
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:36,641  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Maybe it's based on something
as simple as instinct.

387
00:38:36,727 --> 00:38:39,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- But he might not have been
carrying anything.
- But he might have been carrying...

388
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:42,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in his pants.

389
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:44,886  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Dunn.
- I gotta go.

390
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:49,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah, I know.
I'll be right down.

391
00:38:49,447 --> 00:38:52,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- One last question.
- What?

392
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:54,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That car accident you were in.

393
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:56,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Was there anyone else involved?

394
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:02,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah.
My wife, Audrey.

395
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:04,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She was in the car with me.

396
00:39:06,287 --> 00:39:09,085  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Have a good life, Elijah.

397
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:12,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Next time, try to buy your tickets
at an authorized sales location.

398
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:16,366  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Dunn.
- I'm on my way.

399
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:22,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574

405
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:44,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hold up a second!

406
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:40,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I just want to askyou something.

407
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:49,727  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Dad! Hey, Dad!

408
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:58,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Dad!

409
00:42:08,887 --> 00:42:12,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joseph, do you know how mad
your mother would be if
she knew you were playing football?

410
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:15,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you gonna tell?

411
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:18,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You wanna play last ofthe downs?
We got a big guy like you.

412
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:22,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You could play on opposite sides.
He's Potter's cousin.

413
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:25,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's starting cornerback
at Temple University.

414
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:27,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's going pro in the draft.

415
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:30,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They say he can run the 40
in 4.3 seconds.

416
00:42:30,807 --> 00:42:32,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah, I've heard.

417
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:34,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You can beat him, Dad.

418
00:42:34,727 --> 00:42:37,082  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Let's beat him.
- I'm gonna go in.

419
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:39,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Just play one set ofdowns.
I told them you were great.

420
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:41,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Why'd you do that?
-Just one.

421
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,803  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm gonna go in.
I've got some things to do.

422
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:46,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What things?
- I'm gonna work out.

423
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I'll help you.
- No, l-l don't need--

424
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:51,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I can't play, guys!
I'm working out with my dad!

425
00:42:52,007 --> 00:42:54,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Go, go.
Here we go! Ready?

426
00:42:54,967 --> 00:42:58,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hut! You're doing good.
Right there! Catch!

427
00:42:58,127 --> 00:43:00,322  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'vegot to run

428
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:02,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To keep from hiding

429
00:43:02,967 --> 00:43:05,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Andl'm bound

430
00:43:05,287 --> 00:43:07,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To keep on riding

431
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:12,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Andl'vegot one more silverdollar

432
00:43:12,287 --> 00:43:14,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How much did you put on there?

433
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:26,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You put too much.
That's 250 pounds.

434
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:30,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How much can you lift?

435
00:43:30,287 --> 00:43:32,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's the most I ever lifted.

436
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:37,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That could've been dangerous,Joseph.

437
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why don't you go upstairs now
and let me fiînish up, okay?

438
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:42,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll take it off.
I'll help you right.

439
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:50,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You thinkyou could have
beaten up Bruce Lee?

440
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

441
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:54,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I mean, ifyou knew karate.

442
00:43:54,647 --> 00:43:56,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

443
00:44:00,447 --> 00:44:03,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, what if he wasn't allowed to kick,
and you were really mad at him?

444
00:44:03,527 --> 00:44:05,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No,Joseph.

445
00:44:45,087 --> 00:44:47,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How much did you take off?

446
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:51,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I lied.

447
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:56,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You added?

448
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:05,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How much is it?

449
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:09,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
270 pounds.

450
00:45:12,487 --> 00:45:14,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's put more.

451
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:18,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Okay.

452
00:45:22,927 --> 00:45:25,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why don't you move back a little
just to be safe, okay?

453
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
More?

454
00:46:09,727 --> 00:46:13,402  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You should never do anything like this.
You know that, right?

455
00:46:15,127 --> 00:46:17,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What do you do
ifsomething bad happens?

456
00:46:17,607 --> 00:46:19,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get Mom.

457
00:46:20,087 --> 00:46:21,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Right.

458
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:58,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How much did you put on that time?

459
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:03,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All of it.

460
00:47:05,567 --> 00:47:07,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What else can we use?

461
00:47:33,007 --> 00:47:34,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How much is it?

462
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:45,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How much is it, Dad?

463
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:50,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
About 350 pounds.

464
00:47:57,607 --> 00:47:59,484  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Fracture ofthe fiîfth metacarpal
ofthe right hand...

465
00:47:59,567 --> 00:48:02,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
as well as multiple fractures of
the sixth, seventh and eighth ribs.

466
00:48:02,887 --> 00:48:05,321  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The worst ofthe injury, however,
was sustained to the right leg...

467
00:48:05,407 --> 00:48:07,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
in the form ofa spiral fracture.

468
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:09,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There were 1 4 breaks.

469
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:12,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It simply shattered.

470
00:48:12,247 --> 00:48:14,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They call me Mr Glass.

471
00:48:14,807 --> 00:48:18,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Who does?
- Kids.

472
00:48:18,447 --> 00:48:20,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you all right, Mr Price?

473
00:48:20,527 --> 00:48:22,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Shall I continue?

474
00:48:23,727 --> 00:48:26,002  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Pins were placed throughout
the length ofthe leg.

475
00:48:26,087 --> 00:48:28,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The use ofa wheelchair will be needed
for a two-month period.

476
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:32,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The use ofcrutches will follow
for 1 2 to 1 4 months.

477
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:34,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hospital stay will range
from fiîve to eight days...

478
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:37,046  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
followed by nine to twelve months
of physical therapy.

479
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:39,721  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Prescribed medication for pain
management will take the usual forms...

480
00:48:39,807 --> 00:48:42,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
of morphine drip, percocet, darvocet.

481
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:55,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your, uh, 1 0:00 is here.

482
00:48:55,607 --> 00:48:57,643  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The hospital discharged him
this morning.

483
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:01,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thanks.

484
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:11,166  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Elijah, right?

485
00:49:11,245 --> 00:49:14,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're gonna prevent any substantial
atrophy ofyour good leg with this...

486
00:49:15,005 --> 00:49:17,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and it works your quadriceps.

487
00:49:18,245 --> 00:49:20,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How long have you been married?

488
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:25,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Twelve years.
- How'd you get together?

489
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm a little nervous being here.

490
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:33,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I ask too many questions
when I'm nervous.

491
00:49:35,285 --> 00:49:37,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A car accident.

492
00:49:37,285 --> 00:49:40,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh. And now you're gonna
have to tell me more.

493
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:47,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My husband was a star athlete
in college...

494
00:49:47,565 --> 00:49:49,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and we were in
an accident together.

495
00:49:51,085 --> 00:49:54,964  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Our car flipped on an icy road
and we were both injured, and he
couldn't play football any more.

496
00:49:55,045 --> 00:49:57,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And ifthat hadn't happened,
we probably wouldn't have been together.

497
00:49:57,805 --> 00:50:01,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How so?
- I think we should talk
about your rehab.

498
00:50:01,445 --> 00:50:03,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You don't have to answer
ifyou don't want to.

499
00:50:04,765 --> 00:50:08,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So, tell me more
about the quad machine.

500
00:50:09,405 --> 00:50:12,203  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It prevents atrophy by--

501
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I couldn't spend my life
with someone who played football.

502
00:50:16,085 --> 00:50:17,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's pretty much that simple.

503
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:22,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I mean, I don't hate the game. I admire
the amount ofskill it involves.

504
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And-And like everyone else,
I was in awe ofthe way he played it.

505
00:50:25,045 --> 00:50:29,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But football, in many ways,
is the opposite ofwhat I do.

506
00:50:30,325 --> 00:50:32,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're rewarded the more
you punish your opponent.

507
00:50:32,805 --> 00:50:36,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know, it's too much about violence,
and I don't want violence in my life.

508
00:50:37,365 --> 00:50:40,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's not a thing many people
can understand, but--

509
00:50:40,965 --> 00:50:43,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Anyway, fate stepped in
with that car accident...

510
00:50:44,005 --> 00:50:46,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and took football out ofthe equation.

511
00:50:46,245 --> 00:50:49,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And everyone lived happily ever after.

512
00:50:51,005 --> 00:50:52,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sort of.

513
00:50:52,645 --> 00:50:55,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What part of David's body was injured?

514
00:50:57,005 --> 00:50:59,724  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who said my husband's name was David?

515
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:09,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ladiesandgentlemen--

516
00:51:20,325 --> 00:51:22,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
In the first half--

517
00:51:50,205 --> 00:51:52,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A 737 crashes on takeoff--

518
00:51:52,725 --> 00:51:55,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
1 72 die, no survivors.

519
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:59,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A hotel fiîre downtown--
2 1 1 die, no survivors.

520
00:51:59,925 --> 00:52:03,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
An Eastrail train derails
7 1 /2 miles outside the city--

521
00:52:03,805 --> 00:52:05,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
1 31 die...

522
00:52:05,805 --> 00:52:07,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
one survivor.

523
00:52:07,885 --> 00:52:10,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He is unharmed.

524
00:52:10,165 --> 00:52:12,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've spoken with your husband
about his survival.

525
00:52:13,045 --> 00:52:15,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I suggested a rather
unbelievable possibility.

526
00:52:15,845 --> 00:52:18,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Since then, I've come to believe
that possibility...

527
00:52:18,965 --> 00:52:20,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
however unbelievable...

528
00:52:20,965 --> 00:52:23,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
is now more a probability.

529
00:52:23,405 --> 00:52:26,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And what was it you suggested?

530
00:52:26,245 --> 00:52:28,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn.

531
00:52:28,925 --> 00:52:32,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
People are starting to lose hope.
It's hard for many to believe...

532
00:52:32,445 --> 00:52:36,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
there are extraordinary things
inside themselves as well as others.

533
00:52:36,405 --> 00:52:39,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I hope you can keep an open mind.

534
00:53:19,685 --> 00:53:22,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Excuse me, sir?

535
00:53:22,245 --> 00:53:24,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can you step out of line, please?

536
00:53:28,525 --> 00:53:32,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We've been having some problems
with people selling drugs
here in the stadium.

537
00:53:32,405 --> 00:53:34,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Would you mind if I checkyour pockets?

538
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:38,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Raise your arms, please.

539
00:53:38,525 --> 00:53:40,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come on, raise them up.

540
00:53:40,525 --> 00:53:42,641  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I just got here, man.

541
00:53:52,805 --> 00:53:54,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can I put my hands down now?

542
00:54:00,285 --> 00:54:02,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can I go?

543
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:05,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah.

544
00:54:06,685 --> 00:54:08,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hope you fiînd them.

545
00:54:17,485 --> 00:54:21,603  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Yo, Dunn.
- Yeah.

546
00:54:21,685 --> 00:54:24,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ijust came into the office.
Yourkid washurt.

547
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:28,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Where is he?
- Someplay rehearsalatschool.

548
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:31,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He wantsyou to come down there.

549
00:54:45,005 --> 00:54:47,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Is that your dad?

550
00:54:50,485 --> 00:54:53,522  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I bet my dad could beat up your dad.

551
00:54:56,845 --> 00:54:59,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, he, uh, he insisted
we call only you...

552
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:01,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
though we had some trouble
tracking you down.

553
00:55:02,045 --> 00:55:04,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I mean, you're not on our list.

554
00:55:05,245 --> 00:55:06,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Audrey handles this type ofstuff.

555
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh. What type ofstuff?

556
00:55:10,845 --> 00:55:12,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joseph stuff.

557
00:55:15,725 --> 00:55:18,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do I need to put any smelly ointment
on him or anything?

558
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:20,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, no, it's more emotional damage.

559
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:23,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not, uh-- Not to serious, physically.

560
00:55:23,605 --> 00:55:26,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Nothing like when I sent you
to the hospital.

561
00:55:30,765 --> 00:55:32,881  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When was that?

562
00:55:32,965 --> 00:55:37,402  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My offiîce was on the other side
ofthe building back then.

563
00:55:39,765 --> 00:55:42,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You don't remember me, do you?

564
00:55:44,285 --> 00:55:48,164  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No, ma'am.
- I had red hair.

565
00:55:50,325 --> 00:55:54,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, you were a little younger
thanJoseph when it happened.

566
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:58,401  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Did you know that we
changed the rules ofconduct...

567
00:55:58,485 --> 00:56:01,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
around the pool because ofyou?

568
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The kids still tell about it...

569
00:56:05,485 --> 00:56:08,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Iike it was some sort of ghost story.

570
00:56:08,885 --> 00:56:13,003  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"Did you know there was a kid
nearly drowned in that pool?

571
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:17,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He lay on the bottom ofthe pool
for fiîve minutes.

572
00:56:17,565 --> 00:56:21,604  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And when they pulled him out,
he was dead."

573
00:56:26,045 --> 00:56:29,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We let them tell it.
It helps keep them safe.

574
00:56:33,365 --> 00:56:35,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You still phobic ofwater?

575
00:56:38,685 --> 00:56:40,641  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It was Potter and another guy.

576
00:56:41,925 --> 00:56:45,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They were messing with
this Chinese girl in the dressing room.

577
00:56:45,805 --> 00:56:49,002  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Y-You can't let bad things
happen to good people, right?

578
00:56:50,085 --> 00:56:53,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's your code, right?
That's the hero's code.

579
00:56:54,885 --> 00:56:56,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I tried to make them stop...

580
00:56:56,885 --> 00:57:00,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but they kept pushing me down,
and they wouldn't let me get back up.

581
00:57:03,485 --> 00:57:06,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I thought maybe 'cause you're my dad...

582
00:57:07,285 --> 00:57:09,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I thought I might be like you.

583
00:57:12,965 --> 00:57:14,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm not like you.

584
00:57:16,685 --> 00:57:19,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are like me.

585
00:57:19,845 --> 00:57:21,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We can both get hurt.

586
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:27,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I'm just an ordinary man.
- No, you're not.

587
00:57:27,365 --> 00:57:30,084  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why do you keep saying that?

588
00:57:37,485 --> 00:57:40,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Elijah Price came to visit me
at the centre today.

589
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:44,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Jesus.

590
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:47,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He didn't do anything. Hejust...

591
00:57:47,285 --> 00:57:49,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
told me his theory.

592
00:57:50,285 --> 00:57:52,845  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's sad when patients get like that.

593
00:57:52,925 --> 00:57:54,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They lose reality.

594
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:02,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joseph, what the hell are you doing?

595
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:04,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, my God.

596
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:07,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You don't believe. I'll show you.
You can't get hurt.

597
00:58:07,845 --> 00:58:10,643  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That gun's not loaded. He doesn't
know where I keep the bullets.

598
00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:13,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
In your Rookie ofthe Year trophy.

599
00:58:13,725 --> 00:58:16,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joseph, did you load the gun?

600
00:58:16,485 --> 00:58:20,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You won't get hurt.
- Elijah was wrong.

601
00:58:20,085 --> 00:58:22,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- When did he meet Elijah?
- He was with me when I met him.

602
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:24,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No one believes him.

603
00:58:24,565 --> 00:58:27,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joseph, listen to me.

604
00:58:27,485 --> 00:58:32,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sometimes when people get sick or hurt
for a long time, like Elijah...

605
00:58:32,485 --> 00:58:36,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
their mind gets hurt too, and they
start to think things that aren't true.

606
00:58:36,285 --> 00:58:39,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He told me what he thought
about your father. It isn't true.

607
00:58:40,005 --> 00:58:41,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll show you.

608
00:58:44,445 --> 00:58:48,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you remember the story about the--
about the boy that almost
drowned in the pool?

609
00:58:48,405 --> 00:58:50,965  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That was me they were talking about.
I almost died. That was me.

610
00:58:51,045 --> 00:58:53,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying, okay?
I just didn't remember it, that's all.

611
00:58:53,805 --> 00:58:55,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joseph, you know your father
was injured in college.

612
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know that.
You know all about that.

613
00:58:59,765 --> 00:59:02,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't do it.
He'll die,Joseph.

614
00:59:02,285 --> 00:59:06,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I'll just shoot him once.
-Joseph, listen to what your moth--

615
00:59:06,685 --> 00:59:08,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't be scared.

616
00:59:09,765 --> 00:59:11,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joseph...

617
00:59:11,765 --> 00:59:14,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
ifyou pull that trigger,
I'm going to leave.

618
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:17,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you understand?
I'm going to go to New York.

619
00:59:17,605 --> 00:59:20,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Y-Y-You're right.
Ifyou pull that trigger...

620
00:59:21,045 --> 00:59:24,162  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
that bullet isjust gonna bounce off me,
and I'm not going to be hurt.

621
00:59:24,245 --> 00:59:26,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But then I'm going to go upstairs
and I'm gonna pack...

622
00:59:26,565 --> 00:59:29,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and I'm going to leave for New York.

623
00:59:29,725 --> 00:59:34,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Why?
- Because I thought we werejust
starting to be friends for real.

624
00:59:34,525 --> 00:59:36,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And friends'll listen to each other.
They don't--

625
00:59:36,525 --> 00:59:40,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And-And they don't shoot each other,
uh, uh, do they, Audrey?

626
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:43,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
N-No shooting friends,Joseph.

627
00:59:43,285 --> 00:59:45,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joseph!

628
00:59:45,725 --> 00:59:48,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You are about to be in big trouble!

629
00:59:49,805 --> 00:59:51,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now, I am your father,
and I am telling you...

630
00:59:51,805 --> 00:59:54,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
to put that goddamn gun down
right now!

631
00:59:54,965 --> 00:59:57,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
One, two--

632
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:18,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I followed the guy
in the camouflagejacket.

633
01:00:20,005 --> 01:00:25,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He had a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in the back of his pants.

634
01:00:26,925 --> 01:00:30,042  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Were you really injured
in that car accident in college?

635
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:33,481  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
'Cause I believe you faked it.
I believe you took the opportunity...

636
01:00:33,565 --> 01:00:36,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
to end your football career,
no questions asked.

637
01:00:36,285 --> 01:00:39,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I thinkyou did it,
ofall things, for a woman.

638
01:00:39,965 --> 01:00:41,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I guess that makes sense.

639
01:00:41,965 --> 01:00:45,082  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Football's what, just ten years?

640
01:00:45,165 --> 01:00:49,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But love?
Hmm. Now, that's forever.

641
01:00:51,805 --> 01:00:54,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And that little bit ofsadness
in the mornings you spoke of?

642
01:00:54,965 --> 01:00:57,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think I know what that is.

643
01:00:57,205 --> 01:01:00,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Perhaps you're not doing
what you're supposed to be doing.

644
01:01:00,645 --> 01:01:02,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Most guns have a black
or silver handle.

645
01:01:02,645 --> 01:01:04,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I had a 50-50 shot
of getting the colour right.

646
01:01:04,645 --> 01:01:07,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- That's not what I witnessed.
- Stop.

647
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:10,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stop messing with my life, Elijah.

648
01:01:10,965 --> 01:01:14,401  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My son almost shot me last night because
he wanted to prove you were right.

649
01:01:14,485 --> 01:01:16,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I never said you couldn't be killed.

650
01:01:16,485 --> 01:01:18,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I never said that.
- My wife was right.

651
01:01:18,485 --> 01:01:23,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There have been three major disasters,
and you were the only one unharmed.

652
01:01:23,205 --> 01:01:25,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I have been sick.

653
01:01:27,245 --> 01:01:31,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When I was a kid, I spent a week in the
hospital getting better from pneumonia.

654
01:01:31,845 --> 01:01:35,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I almost drowned.
Two skinny little kids...

655
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,881  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
were fooling around in a pool dunking me
and I swallowed some water.

656
01:01:38,965 --> 01:01:41,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They didn't know it,
and it almost killed me.

657
01:01:42,045 --> 01:01:44,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Heroes don't get killed like that.

658
01:01:44,605 --> 01:01:46,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Normal people do, right?

659
01:01:48,285 --> 01:01:51,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't need to see you any more, okay?

660
01:01:52,605 --> 01:01:54,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please stay away from my family.

661
01:02:03,325 --> 01:02:06,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574

663
01:02:08,445 --> 01:02:10,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, man, it's 20 after.
It's time to choose.

664
01:02:10,645 --> 01:02:12,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I gotta head.

665

666

674

The baby-sitter's here.

675
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:53,002  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Should we cancel?
- I'm fiîne.

676
01:02:55,885 --> 01:02:58,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We can do this another time.

677
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:00,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't lie.

678
01:03:02,525 --> 01:03:05,085  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm fiîne. I just got mixed up.

679
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:14,685  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How about wejust go
for a couple drinks?

680
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:22,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Okay, look, man,
I'm-l'm just gonna wheel you out.

681
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:24,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All right? You can think about things
outside on the sidewalk.

682
01:03:24,845 --> 01:03:26,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I gotta get some chicken in me,
you know what I'm sayin'?

683
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:29,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've been tired, I've been tired

684
01:03:29,965 --> 01:03:34,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired

685
01:03:43,165 --> 01:03:46,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Itoldthe tale ofagirl
- Shit!

686
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She'sa little bit olderthan me

687
01:03:48,645 --> 01:03:51,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Strong legs, strong face
voice like milk

688
01:03:51,365 --> 01:03:53,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Breasts like a clusterofgrapes

689
01:03:53,365 --> 01:03:55,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ican't escape her ways

690
01:03:55,645 --> 01:03:57,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She raise me

691
01:04:01,685 --> 01:04:05,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Dude.
- Even ifyou have no one

692
01:04:05,605 --> 01:04:07,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Man, I don't care ifyou are in
a wheelchair. Ifyou do that again...

693
01:04:07,645 --> 01:04:10,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm calling 5-0.

694
01:04:10,165 --> 01:04:12,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And whileyou're at it, baby

695
01:04:12,245 --> 01:04:14,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Man.

696
01:04:19,485 --> 01:04:23,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You don't want to sleep
aftersetting my loins on fire

697
01:04:24,005 --> 01:04:27,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's it, crackerjack. You're gonna
be sitting your ass in jail now.

698
01:04:27,325 --> 01:04:31,841  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired

699
01:04:31,925 --> 01:04:35,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've been tired, I've been tired

700
01:04:44,645 --> 01:04:47,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've been tired, I've been tired

701
01:04:47,765 --> 01:04:50,802  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I've been tired, I've been tired
- How much for this one?

702
01:04:50,885 --> 01:04:52,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've been tired

703
01:04:53,725 --> 01:04:56,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Rust?
- Yeah.

704
01:04:57,045 --> 01:04:59,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
As a colour, not as rust.

705
01:04:59,365 --> 01:05:03,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know, like rust-coloured
paint or wood.

706
01:05:04,845 --> 01:05:07,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

707
01:05:08,085 --> 01:05:10,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mine's still brown.

708
01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:12,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Okay, my turn.

709
01:05:12,645 --> 01:05:14,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Favourite song?

710
01:05:14,845 --> 01:05:18,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"Soft and Wet" by the Artist
Formerly Known as Prince.

711
01:05:18,925 --> 01:05:21,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What?

712
01:05:21,245 --> 01:05:23,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're supposed to be honest.

713
01:05:23,965 --> 01:05:26,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"Soft And Wet."

714
01:05:26,365 --> 01:05:28,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's very interesting.

715
01:05:28,685 --> 01:05:30,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Okay, my turn.

716
01:05:32,245 --> 01:05:34,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When was the fiîrst time...

717
01:05:35,645 --> 01:05:38,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
the thought popped into your head
we might not make it?

718
01:05:40,005 --> 01:05:41,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's not the game.

719
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:44,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's the fiîrst date.
There aren't any rules.

720
01:05:48,925 --> 01:05:52,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Don't know for sure.
- Think carefully.

721
01:05:53,565 --> 01:05:55,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What about the game?

722
01:05:55,565 --> 01:05:57,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's over. I won.

723
01:05:59,405 --> 01:06:01,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look, maybe it wasn't
a specifiîc moment.

724
01:06:01,405 --> 01:06:05,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Maybe it was a time--
- I had a nightmare one night...

725
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:11,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and I didn't wake you up so you
could tell me that it was okay.

726
01:06:13,085 --> 01:06:15,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think that was the fiîrst time.

727
01:06:17,325 --> 01:06:19,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Does that count?

728
01:06:20,725 --> 01:06:22,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That counts.

729
01:06:26,205 --> 01:06:29,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you knowingly keep me
and Joseph at a distance?

730
01:06:37,325 --> 01:06:39,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes.

731
01:06:39,725 --> 01:06:41,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why?

732
01:06:43,725 --> 01:06:45,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't know.

733
01:06:49,965 --> 01:06:52,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I just don't feel right, Audrey.

734
01:06:53,805 --> 01:06:56,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Something's...

735
01:06:56,165 --> 01:06:58,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
just not right.

736
01:07:00,325 --> 01:07:03,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you resent us, David?

737
01:07:03,445 --> 01:07:05,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Resent the life you have?

738
01:07:07,685 --> 01:07:11,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I mean, there were a lot ofother things
you could've done after college.

739
01:07:11,245 --> 01:07:13,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
These were your choices.

740
01:07:18,005 --> 01:07:20,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know, even if it meant
we couldn't have been together...

741
01:07:20,285 --> 01:07:23,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I never would've wished
that injury on you.

742
01:07:23,685 --> 01:07:26,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What you could do physically...

743
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
was a gift.

744
01:07:28,365 --> 01:07:31,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I never would've wished it to go away.

745
01:07:33,165 --> 01:07:35,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know that, right?

746
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:41,844  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You had two calls afterJoseph
went to bed. One came through...

747
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:44,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
while I was on the other line,
but I wasn't talking too long.

748
01:07:44,205 --> 01:07:47,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There was an emergency with my sister.
She tried to do her own perm, and now
she looks like she stuck her head--

749
01:07:47,965 --> 01:07:50,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who called through?

750
01:07:50,085 --> 01:07:52,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Um, someone from New York...

751
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
uh, about a securityjob.

752
01:07:54,525 --> 01:07:57,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They want to hire you. I didn't know
you guys were moving to New York.

753
01:07:57,685 --> 01:07:59,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thanks for telling me.

754
01:08:00,085 --> 01:08:02,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We weren't all gonna move.

755
01:08:03,685 --> 01:08:05,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh.

756
01:08:07,445 --> 01:08:10,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I let the answering machine
pick up the other call.

757
01:08:14,605 --> 01:08:16,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Great.

758
01:08:27,565 --> 01:08:31,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look, let'sjust be honest here.
We'rejust at the beginning...

759
01:08:31,285 --> 01:08:34,163  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and I don't expect
you or I to change...

760
01:08:34,245 --> 01:08:36,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
the course ofwhere
our lives were headed...

761
01:08:36,685 --> 01:08:38,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
because ofone date.

762
01:08:38,965 --> 01:08:43,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And ifyou do go to New York,
we can develop this.

763
01:08:43,325 --> 01:08:46,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We'll just be forced to take it slow.

764
01:08:46,445 --> 01:08:50,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And in the end, I think
that's defiînitely better.

765
01:08:52,485 --> 01:08:54,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I mean, this is our second time around,
David. I didn't expect us...

766
01:08:54,765 --> 01:08:56,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
to get carried away.

767
01:08:59,125 --> 01:09:02,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But I guess "congratulations"
is the right thing to say.

768
01:09:26,605 --> 01:09:28,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
David, it's Eliijah.

769
01:09:28,845 --> 01:09:30,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It wasso obvious.

770
01:09:30,845 --> 01:09:33,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It was this one issue
that brought it backforme--

771
01:09:33,165 --> 01:09:35,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Century Comics 1 17.

772
01:09:35,165 --> 01:09:37,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's where thisgroup,
the Coalition ofEvil...

773
01:09:37,285 --> 01:09:39,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
triedto ascertain the weakness
ofeverysuperhero...

774
01:09:39,765 --> 01:09:43,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
because theyallhave one,
just likeyou.

775
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:47,004  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yourbones don't break.
Mine do. That's clear.

776
01:09:47,085 --> 01:09:50,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yourcells react to bacteria
and viruses differentlythan mine.

777
01:09:50,485 --> 01:09:54,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You don'tgetsick.
Ido. That'salso clear.

778
01:09:54,365 --> 01:09:59,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But forsome reason, you andl
react the exactsame wayto water.

779
01:09:59,525 --> 01:10:01,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Weswallowit too fast, we choke.

780
01:10:01,925 --> 01:10:04,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Wegetsome in ourlungs, we drown.

781
01:10:04,165 --> 01:10:09,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Howeverunrealit mayseem,
we are connected, you andl.

782
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:13,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're on thesame curve,
just on opposite ends.

783
01:10:13,685 --> 01:10:17,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thepoint ofallthis is we
nowknowsomething we didn 't.

784
01:10:17,645 --> 01:10:21,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You have a weakness-- water.

785
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:23,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's likeyourkryptonite.

786
01:10:24,045 --> 01:10:26,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You hearingme, David?

787
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Audrey?

788
01:13:09,645 --> 01:13:11,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Gotcha. Come on.

789
01:13:28,845 --> 01:13:31,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Audrey. Audrey.

790
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey!

791
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:45,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You'll be okay.

792
01:13:45,885 --> 01:13:49,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What-- What happened?

793
01:13:49,605 --> 01:13:53,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I thought I was--
I thought I was dead.

794
01:13:53,445 --> 01:13:55,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Me too.

795
01:13:59,645 --> 01:14:01,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Is she all right?

796
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:03,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think her leg's broken.

797
01:14:03,965 --> 01:14:06,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you hurt?

798
01:14:06,485 --> 01:14:08,601  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, man, are you hurt?

799
01:14:37,805 --> 01:14:39,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hello.

800
01:14:39,805 --> 01:14:42,444  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I wasn 't injuredin that caraccident.

801
01:14:42,525 --> 01:14:45,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
David.

802
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:47,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've neverbeen injured, Eliijah.

803
01:14:49,805 --> 01:14:52,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What am lsupposedto do?

804
01:14:57,725 --> 01:15:00,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Go to where people are.

805
01:15:00,565 --> 01:15:03,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You won't have to look very long.

806
01:15:05,005 --> 01:15:07,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's all right to be afraid, David...

807
01:15:07,925 --> 01:15:11,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
because this part won't be
like a comic book.

808
01:15:11,885 --> 01:15:16,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Real life doesn't fiît into little boxes
that were drawn for it.

809
01:15:53,325 --> 01:15:57,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's one in the fiîrst row.
It's-- It's the second one.

810
01:15:57,205 --> 01:15:59,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes. It's the second one over.

811
01:16:31,765 --> 01:16:33,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Go back to Africa!

812
01:16:49,485 --> 01:16:51,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, what's your name?

813
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:59,161  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I thinkyou drank too much.

814
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:44,881  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can I come in?

815
01:17:44,965 --> 01:17:47,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who are you?

816
01:17:47,485 --> 01:17:50,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I like your house.

817
01:17:50,245 --> 01:17:52,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can I come in?

818
01:17:52,245 --> 01:17:54,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What is this?

819
01:17:55,965 --> 01:17:59,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, you can't come in.

820
01:17:59,205 --> 01:18:01,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you sure?

821
01:18:01,645 --> 01:18:03,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What are-- What are you--

822
01:22:22,965 --> 01:22:24,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's okay.

823
01:22:34,805 --> 01:22:36,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's okay. It's okay.

824
01:29:03,885 --> 01:29:06,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I had a bad dream.

825
01:29:12,005 --> 01:29:14,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's over now.

826
01:29:40,925 --> 01:29:43,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't know.

827
01:29:43,725 --> 01:29:45,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I can't believe you'd think that.

828
01:29:45,805 --> 01:29:47,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm just asking you.

829
01:29:50,845 --> 01:29:52,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm making French toast.

830
01:30:07,765 --> 01:30:10,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've been thinking about Elijah Price.

831
01:30:11,485 --> 01:30:15,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If he shows up again, I think
we should call the police, okay?

832
01:30:19,045 --> 01:30:20,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Okay?

833
01:30:23,365 --> 01:30:25,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Okay.

834
01:31:30,605 --> 01:31:32,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You were right.

835
01:32:20,165 --> 01:32:24,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is one ofJohann Davis'
earliest drawings.

836
01:32:24,165 --> 01:32:26,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
See the villain's eyes?

837
01:32:26,525 --> 01:32:28,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They're larger than
the other characters'.

838
01:32:28,765 --> 01:32:34,044  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They insinuate a slightly skewed
perspective on how they see the world--

839
01:32:35,125 --> 01:32:37,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
just off normal.

840
01:32:37,405 --> 01:32:39,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He doesn't look scary.

841
01:32:39,725 --> 01:32:42,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mm-hmm. That's what I said to my son.

842
01:32:42,205 --> 01:32:44,765  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But he says there's always two kinds.

843
01:32:44,845 --> 01:32:49,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's the soldier villain
who fiîghts the hero with his hands...

844
01:32:49,165 --> 01:32:53,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and then there's the real threat--
the brilliant and evil archenemy...

845
01:32:53,365 --> 01:32:55,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
who fiîghts the hero with his mind.

846
01:32:55,845 --> 01:32:57,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you Elijah's mother?

847
01:32:57,845 --> 01:33:01,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.

848
01:33:01,525 --> 01:33:04,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Nice to meet you. I'm David Dunn.

849
01:33:04,285 --> 01:33:06,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's spoken ofyou.

850
01:33:06,285 --> 01:33:08,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Says you're becoming friends.

851
01:33:08,285 --> 01:33:10,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We are.

852
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:12,801  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Looks like he's doing good today.

853
01:33:13,885 --> 01:33:16,683  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm very proud of him.

854
01:33:16,765 --> 01:33:19,723  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's come through a lot in his life--

855
01:33:19,805 --> 01:33:23,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
a couple of bad spills
I thought had broken him.

856
01:33:23,285 --> 01:33:26,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mm-hmm. They were bad...

857
01:33:27,365 --> 01:33:29,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
but he made it.

858
01:33:29,885 --> 01:33:31,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, he did.

859
01:33:32,885 --> 01:33:35,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's kind ofa miracle.

860
01:33:37,085 --> 01:33:38,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, he is.

861
01:33:42,405 --> 01:33:44,965  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thankyou.

862
01:33:46,245 --> 01:33:49,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We'll work something out.
Always able to work something out.

863
01:34:13,885 --> 01:34:15,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It has begun.

864
01:34:18,805 --> 01:34:20,841  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Tell me something, David.

865
01:34:21,925 --> 01:34:26,282  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When you woke up this morning,
was it still there?

866
01:34:26,365 --> 01:34:29,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The sadness?

867
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:31,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

868
01:34:34,565 --> 01:34:37,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think this is where we shake hands.

869
01:34:55,725 --> 01:34:58,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Look!
- Did you see it?

870
01:35:07,645 --> 01:35:10,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I worked in that building 25 years.

871
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:12,161  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I know all its secrets.

872
01:35:13,565 --> 01:35:15,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Secrets?

873
01:35:16,845 --> 01:35:21,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Like ifthere ever was a fiîre
on floors one, two or three...

874
01:35:21,645 --> 01:35:25,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
everyone in that hotel
would be burned alive.

875
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:33,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Passengers aren't allowed in there.

876
01:36:14,885 --> 01:36:17,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you know what
the scariest thing is?

877
01:36:20,805 --> 01:36:23,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To not know your place
in this world...

878
01:36:24,045 --> 01:36:26,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
to not know why you're here.

879
01:36:27,725 --> 01:36:29,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's--

880
01:36:31,405 --> 01:36:33,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That'sjust an awful feeling.

881
01:36:35,045 --> 01:36:37,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What have you done?

882
01:36:38,405 --> 01:36:41,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I almost gave up hope.

883
01:36:41,405 --> 01:36:44,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There were so many times
I questioned myself.

884
01:36:44,565 --> 01:36:46,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You killed all those people.

885
01:36:48,245 --> 01:36:50,964  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But I found you.

886
01:36:51,045 --> 01:36:54,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So many sacrifiîces...

887
01:36:55,285 --> 01:36:57,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
just to fiînd you.

888
01:36:57,285 --> 01:36:59,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Jesus Christ!

889
01:37:08,685 --> 01:37:11,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now that we know who you are...

890
01:37:12,445 --> 01:37:15,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I know who I am.

891
01:37:18,485 --> 01:37:20,601  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm not a mistake.

892
01:37:22,045 --> 01:37:24,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It all makes sense.

893
01:37:24,205 --> 01:37:28,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
In a comic, you know how you can tell
who the arch-villain's going to be?

894
01:37:28,685 --> 01:37:31,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's the exact opposite ofthe hero.

895
01:37:32,005 --> 01:37:35,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And most times, they're friends,
like you and me.

896
01:37:35,685 --> 01:37:39,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I should've known way back when.
You know why, David?

897
01:37:39,445 --> 01:37:41,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Because ofthe kids.

898
01:37:50,885 --> 01:37:53,445  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They called me Mr Glass.

899
01:42:18,768 --> 00:00:00,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
