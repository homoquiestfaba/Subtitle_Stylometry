1
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,927
<i>First</i> Of all,

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,602
<i>I realize this is probably
not how you thought the story would start,</i>

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,922
<i>not with a big shiny moon</i>

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,004
<i>or a city that could look
stunning in spite of itself.</i>

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,086
<i>Or me.</i>

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,123
<i>But I wanted you to know
that before the horror began,</i>

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,647
<i>before it all came crashing down,</i>

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,929
<i>there was a time when capes
and cowls and fighting crime</i>

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,684
<i>really was exciting.</i>

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,642
<i>I'd been with Batman
for almost three years.</i>

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,486
<i>That night my father signaled
for him, so something was up.</i>

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,846
<i>I tend to stay out of these discussions.</i>

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,002
<i>I mean, why push my luck?</i>

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,249
- You there?
- Yeah.

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,205
We've got a robbery.

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,241
Bloody son of a...

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,125
You act like you've never been
in a police chase before.

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,845
- Take the next left.
- Here?

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,527
Here.

20
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,771
We've got to lose the truck.

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,048
Let's lose the cops instead, okay?

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,882
This is going to be a night to remember.

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,441
Fricking A!

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,890
Caution, falling debris.

25
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,090
Okay, we lose the truck.

26
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,601
You really want to turn
a robbery into a murder?

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,564
You see another way out of this?

28
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,048
I know you're in a bad spot.

29
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,360
But there's bad and then there's worse.

30
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,207
Like that.

31
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,606
Negotiating?

32
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,921
He wasn't going to hurt me.

33
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,286
Did he know that?

34
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,121
Sometimes, you have
to have a little faith.

35
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,806
What happened to the drivers?

36
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,291
They got away-

37
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,646
But the night's still young.

38
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,361
I'm going to need some alone time.

39
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,248
Oh, sure, yeah.

40
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,606
Maybe I'll see you...

41
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,287
Later.

42
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,321
It's a lot of photos.

43
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,569
My uncle's big on family,
even the ones he's hit.

44
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,170
His Holiness is expecting us.

45
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,490
Get the hell in here.

46
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,410
It's all over the news.

47
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,688
Every channel.

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,287
What can I tell you? Batgirl's hot.

49
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,682
Don't get smart.

50
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,403
<i>I lost four men yesterday.</i>

51
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,891
Four idiots.

52
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,884
They said they could
knock out the tracker on the armored car.

53
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,361
I don't think they could plug
a computer in their ass.

54
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,171
Do I care?

55
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,210
I'm out 100 grand,
thanks to your frigging fiasco.

56
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,731
And what do I get for it?

57
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,884
The Bat and his bitch
breathing down my neck.

58
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,600
<i>Bottom line, you're going to give me
my money back, nephew, every cent.</i>

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,040
Otherwise you're going to become
a very distant relative, very soon.

60
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,201
<i>Capisce?</i>

61
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,286
Okay, unc, whatever you say.

62
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,766
Darker men, huh?

63
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,200
Barbara, why didn't you tell me?

64
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,920
I have a cousin who's a defense attorney.

65
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,088
Ooh, Reese, not that dark.

66
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,649
He's single.

67
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,564
Well, that lightens him up
a bit, doesn't it?

68
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,926
Babs, girl,

69
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,242
I do not understand
why you're having fishing troubles

70
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,249
when we are in the middle of a lake.

71
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,368
<i>What do these guys have
to do to get your attention?</i>

72
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,326
Steal a book?

73
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,001
It just so happens
I'm involved with someone.

74
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,282
Sort of, kind of.

75
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,290
That serious, huh?

76
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,441
What are you doing?

77
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,001
My dad's department
has been setting up city cams.

78
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,605
I've been helping with the program.

79
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,764
It's amazing. You can view
half of Gotham from your computer.

80
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,805
Looks like a bad boy, just your type.

81
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,927
Jesus, Paris, a friggin' fortune
in the middle of some dump.

82
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,127
It's ridiculous.

83
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,009
It used to be a bank.

84
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,970
The same family's owned
this building since 1929.

85
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,043
- Which family?
- My uncle's.

86
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,245
You are bloody crazy.

87
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,447
You sound pissed.

88
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,325
- No, I sound freaked the "F" out.
- I'm not.

89
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,889
And that's freaking me, too.

90
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,328
My uncle's a dinosaur, Lonny.

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,563
By the time he finds out
what we've done, he'll be extinct.

92
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,529
No withdrawals today, boys.

93
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,011
Bloody hell, it's her!

94
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,884
Batgirl, I am impressed.

95
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,923
Where's your overbearing boyfriend?

96
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,366
He's not my boyfriend.

97
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,364
Then maybe I have a chance.

98
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,931
What are you doing?

99
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,570
I want to meet her.

100
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,205
(%GUNSHOT)

101
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,721
Awesome.

102
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,251
I don't want to have to hurt you.

103
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,971
Why should you be different
from all the other girls?

104
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,721
It's like a dance.

105
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,086
Yeah, right.

106
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,608
Too bad we can't sit this one out.

107
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,928
I don't waste my time with punk amateurs.

108
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,686
Oh, baby, I think you've misjudged me.

109
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,290
Smells like cherries, huh?

110
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,689
You've got maybe
10 seconds to bedtime, baby.

111
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,842
Can't end the night without a kiss.

112
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,722
You'll never make it to the door, Batgirl.

113
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,569
Smart girl.

114
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,407
She's taking a nap. Let's grab the money.

115
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,686
Thanks.

116
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,800
How long was I out?

117
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,567
A few minutes.

118
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,927
Apparently, I got there
right after they left.

119
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,164
You should've waited for me.

120
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,481
They were on their way out.

121
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,210
I had to do something.

122
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,121
His name is Paris, Paris Franz.

123
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,805
You're kidding?

124
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,166
I guess not.

125
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,685
Your father gave me his file.

126
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,202
He's a nasty combination
of narcissist and sociopath.

127
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,091
He'll have you smiling right up to
the moment he cuts your throat.

128
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,529
I haven't had to deal
with his type of crazy in a while.

129
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,845
I don't want you to, either.

130
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,765
What are you saying?

131
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,684
Don't go near him without me.

132
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,888
- Excuse me?
- No matter what.

133
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,849
We're not exactly attached at the hip.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,081
We are on this.

135
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,726
You want to work with me,
you do what I say.

136
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,805
And that's it?
You speak and the words are law?

137
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,281
Yes.

138
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,920
<i>REESE". Let me understand.</i>

139
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,281
<i>You're seeing a guy,
but not really dating.</i>

140
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,363
- Right.
- In a yoga class.

141
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,646
Basically.

142
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,410
He's, like, the instructor?

143
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,607
Right.

144
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,245
And he's making demands?

145
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,210
He's always been controlling,
usually I'm okay with it.

146
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,361
But there's no sex?

147
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,726
God, no!

148
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,803
<i>And you're into him because...</i>

149
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,051
Because of the yoga.

150
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,726
I like the yoga.

151
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,690
So, find another class.

152
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,925
There is no other class, Reese.
This is it.

153
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,081
And I'm good.

154
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,250
He won't say it,
but I'm the best damn student he ever had.

155
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,880
So, if he's going to start
making decisions based on emotions

156
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,530
of which he has zero,

157
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,728
then I think we've got a problem!

158
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,762
And they say the gay scene
is complicated. What?

159
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,405
Here you go, ladies,

160
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,927
added token of our appreciation.

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,207
Here's the mask
your buddy wanted me to wear.

162
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,647
Sorry,
we had to cut up the pillowcase.

163
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,445
Got it, thank you.

164
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,251
You know I've got real masks
back at the house,

165
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,521
just saying.

166
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,325
So, how long are we going to be here?

167
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,489
I thought you Brits liked the salt air.

168
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,769
I don't like all that money
sitting under a friggin' sink.

169
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,282
- Feed it to the fish.
- What?

170
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,808
I just got access
to every offshore account my uncle owns.

171
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,806
And she called me an amateur.

172
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,801
<i>Who is it?</i>

173
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,961
It's your uncle.

174
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,646
How do we get out?

175
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,529
You're looking at it.

176
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,162
<i>Batgirl, I'm afraid
I didn't get your number.</i>

177
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,722
<i>So I'm sending this video
to the police to give to you.</i>

178
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,810
<i>They've got to be good for something.</i>

179
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,685
<i>You may have heard
that I've come into some family money.</i>

180
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,291
<i>I told you I'm no punk.</i>

181
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,047
<i>In fact, I got you a gift.</i>

182
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,763
<i>Something special for my special girl.</i>

183
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,404
<i>Just go back to where we met. You'll see.</i>

184
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,125
- Cute.
- It's not cute. It's a trick.

185
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,408
I know, but it is a little flattering.

186
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,210
No, he doesn't know you.

187
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,890
He's objectified you.

188
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,290
When a criminal gets personal like that,
it's bad news.

189
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,401
You're off this one.

190
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,241
- What?
- I don't want you on this case.

191
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,241
At all? So he likes me, we can use that.

192
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,731
He's not afraid of you.

193
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,450
I want him nervous.

194
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,728
The place you met was
at that warehouse, right?

195
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,604
Yeah. Where are you going?

196
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,451
Your father and his men
are already canvassing the place.

197
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,931
I'll let you know what we find.

198
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,923
Hold on, we're not done.

199
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,447
No, wait. Wait!

200
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,801
<i>Hey!</i>

201
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,006
Is this the gift?

202
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,003
'Cause I thought I was
a little more special.

203
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,641
<i>You are, baby.</i>

204
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,127
<i>But the real gift's somewhere</i> else.

205
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,561
<i>Girls like scavenger hunts, don't they?</i>

206
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,644
Is this going to take long?

207
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,411
<i>Careful getting in.</i>

208
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,250
<i>I don't own this place yet.</i>

209
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,810
<i>You're getting hot, hotter.</i>

210
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,166
<i>Whoa, you might have to call
the fire department.</i>

211
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,443
- Where's the gift?
- Come on, look around.

212
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,210
<i>You're the girl detective.</i>

213
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,604
<i>For you, my love.</i>

214
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,325
Do you realize what you've done?

215
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,403
He was the biggest boss in Gotham.

216
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,570
He was an artifact.

217
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,371
He went out with phone booths
and the porkpie hat.

218
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,528
I'm the next evolution, baby.

219
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,407
Today, it's all about brains
and nerve and tech.

220
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,164
That's how I got his money

221
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,760
<i>and that's how I'm going to get you.</i>

222
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,002
<i>- Boss, you okay in there?</i>

223
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,080
- You might have to get in line.
- Break <i>it</i> down.

224
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,046
You let him play you.

225
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,528
He thinks he knows you, like there's
some kind of relationship going.

226
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,523
He led you like a lap dog.

227
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,563
Bull, I knew what I was doing.

228
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,609
I was on the hunt, same as you.

229
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,888
No, you were trying to prove something.

230
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,044
You let your ego cloud your judgment.
You should've listened to me.

231
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,646
- I thought we were partners.
- We are.

232
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,764
But we're not equals, not even close.

233
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,162
You sanctimonious, self-righteous...

234
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,402
You're not in it like I am, Barbara.

235
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,251
It's still a game for you,
it's still a thrill.

236
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,004
You haven't been taken to the edge yet.

237
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,560
The edge of what?

238
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,165
The abyss,

239
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,368
the place where you don't care anymore.

240
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,090
Where all hope dies.

241
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,001
We're done here. You're off the case.

242
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,725
No! This isn't over.

243
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,451
You can't dismiss me
with some metaphysical BS.

244
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,011
Why are you doing this?

245
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,844
- I told you.
- Uh-uh.

246
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,044
We've been up against worse threats
than Paris Franz.

247
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,329
This isn't about me, it's about us.

248
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,444
It's about you getting protective
and sitting in judgment.

249
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,211
I won't have it!

250
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,921
Then get out.

251
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,446
How dare you!

252
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,730
I'm in this because of you!
I did what you wanted.

253
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,006
I made it work!

254
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,286
Barbara Kathleen Gordon,
what the hell have you done?

255
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,968
So, you and yoga guy?

256
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,408
Yeah, a few nights ago.

257
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,126
Girl, you've been holding out. How was it?

258
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,242
- Not so good?
- No, it was fantastic...

259
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,044
Like fireworks.

260
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,201
Yeah?

261
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,567
Except he's been avoiding me.

262
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,643
At least, I think he is.

263
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,881
We haven't talked.

264
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,246
I've been to that dance.

265
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,963
Maybe it was too soon,
even after all this time.

266
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,964
Talk to him, Babs.
Some guys need a period of adjustment.

267
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,322
They get nervous about commitment.

268
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,686
He's only human, right?

269
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,561
<i>In local news,
the city is bracing for gang wars</i>

270
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,281
<i>following the murder of crime boss,
Carlos Francesco, Saturday.</i>

271
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,683
<i>At the same time, the manhunt
goes on for Parry Francesco,</i>

272
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,411
<i>aka Paris Franz, the murder suspect.</i>

273
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,170
<i>Said Detective Harvey Bullock,</i>

274
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,368
<i>"it's like he's fallen off
the face of the Earth..."</i>

275
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,005
From your lips, Harvey.

276
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,521
But I tried to be what you want.

277
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,080
You're not listening to me, Debbie.

278
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,568
So damn clingy.
I feel trapped, like I can't move.

279
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,291
I need space.

280
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,961
Hey, hey, hey!

281
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,562
There... Space.

282
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,203
So, what do you think?

283
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,451
Is it worth a shot?

284
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,801
I'm doing it, anyway.

285
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,881
Hey-

286
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,722
Hi, nothing on cable tonight, so I thought
I'd get out and get some exercise.

287
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,202
Tell me, how's Paris these days?

288
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,566
<i>He's on the move.</i>

289
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,764
We got a tip
he might be hiding out at the docks.

290
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,251
That's where I am right now.

291
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,043
That wouldn't be an invitation, would it?

292
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,201
<i>No.</i>

293
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,004
I was just kidding,

294
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,491
but I'm not that far away.

295
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,641
No.

296
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,451
<i>But what about after you get him?
What then?</i>

297
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,611
Are we back in business?

298
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,290
Oh, come on!

299
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,680
<i>We'll talk later.</i>

300
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,850
It was just sex for God's sake.

301
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,360
It doesn't have to mean anything.

302
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,169
It's not like we have to care,
I don't care.

303
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,449
You don't care.
We just go back like it was. That's all.

304
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,920
<i>Please.</i>

305
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,041
Later.

306
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,687
Bang on, mate!

307
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,600
Take the other side.

308
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,251
Alone at last.

309
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,886
Selfish, foul, piece of garbage!

310
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,684
You ruined everything!

311
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,688
Must be that time of the month.

312
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,160
<i>Thanks to Batman,
Franz was taken into police custody,</i>

313
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,527
<i>ending an intensive city-wide search.</i>

314
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,563
<i>This was the scene earlier today
as he was taken into arraignment.</i>

315
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,927
<i>Love you, Batgirl. Love you.</i>

316
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,681
Batgirl.

317
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,321
Close.

318
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,726
I thought I'd save you
the trouble of ending this.

319
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,523
There's some stuff you might want back.

320
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,285
Can't have smoke bombs
exploding in the apartment.

321
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,565
I'm sorry, it's just that...

322
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,769
I get it. It's one thing
to protect the city,

323
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,321
another when it
narrows down to one person.

324
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,125
Someone you really care about.

325
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,723
I'll find some way to fill my time.

326
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,970
It's just as well, you know.

327
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,046
I saw that abyss you spoke about,

328
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,204
very scary, but so tempting.

329
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,044
<i>I don't know how you resist it.</i>

330
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,930
I don't think it's humanly possible
after a while.

331
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,966
Be careful.

332
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,685
And that was <i>that.</i>

333
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,242
<i>Oh, I'd see him again,
but never as Batgirl.</i>

334
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,283
<i>I really was done
with that part of my life.</i>

335
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,600
<i>A week later, it wouldn't matter anyway.</i>

336
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,649
<i>A terrible storm was moving in</i>

337
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,848
<i>and we'd all be in for it by then.</i>

338
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,570
Hell of a night, huh?

339
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,246
What makes it different
from any other night in Gotham?

340
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,730
Nothing, nothing at all, I suppose.

341
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,007
Commissioner Gordon, uh,
he thought you might like to see this.

342
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,364
- That's an interesting choice of words.
- Come again?

343
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,528
Why would I "like" to see this?

344
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,801
Huh.

345
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,323
Well, I guess "need"
would have been better for you, right?

346
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,888
<i>Coroner came and gave things the eyeball.</i>

347
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,369
<i>Says these poor saps died
probably three years ago.</i>

348
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,567
Died?

349
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,691
Well, we won't know for sure if they was
murdered till after the autopsies.

350
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,331
They were murdered.

351
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,445
What do you make of this?

352
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,803
What do I make?

353
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,527
Well, three years ago
was that dentists' convention.

354
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,809
The one where a handful of conventioneers
never returned home,

355
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,167
just went missing.

356
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,891
Emptied out their bank accounts
and disappeared.

357
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,401
I think we're standing
in the mouth of that.

358
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,484
It's an interesting
choice of words, huh?

359
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,928
Tell Gordon
I'd like to talk to him.

360
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,611
Well, I would,
but tonight's his father-daughter night

361
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,841
and you know he doesn't...

362
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,126
Have to be there.

363
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,322
Tell Gordon I need to talk...

364
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,721
To him.

365
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,289
- Hello?
- Barbara, <i>it's</i> Dad.

366
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,965
Oh, hi, Dad, how's your day?

367
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,650
<i>Not over yet, unfortunately.</i>

368
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,736
<i>I'm sorry, honey,
but I won't be able to make it tonight.</i>

369
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,649
- Something's come up.
- Are you all right?

370
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,848
<i>I'm fine, there's nothing
for you to worry about.</i>

371
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,644
<i>A friend asked me for a favor.</i>

372
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,961
A friend?

373
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,600
<i>Yes, honey, that friend.</i>

374
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,402
You mind telling me what this is about?

375
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,326
Listen to me.

376
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,801
He's been in custody for two years.

377
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,809
If we can prove what we found today...

378
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,241
- He'll confess.
- He's insane.

379
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,562
It's a mistake to think
you know what he'll do.

380
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,008
I'm not here
because of what was found today.

381
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,363
I'm here because I need to be.

382
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,006
Hello, I want to talk.

383
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,568
I've been thinking lately
about you, you and me.

384
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,804
About how this is going to end.

385
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,042
About who will end up killing who.

386
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,047
Perhaps, you'll kill me,
perhaps I'll kill you,

387
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,162
perhaps sooner, perhaps later,
you know that, don't you?

388
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,769
I just, I need to know,

389
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,002
for when that time comes,

390
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,289
that I'd made a genuine attempt
to talk things over,

391
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,331
to try and avert the inevitable,
just once.

392
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,964
Listen to me, this is life and death,

393
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,889
mine or yours.

394
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,125
Our relationship, it's fatal.
I don't want your murder on my...

395
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,961
Hey, wait a minute.
I've got rights.

396
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,925
You ain't allowed to touch me!

397
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,365
Where is he?

398
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,124
Do you realize what you've set free?

399
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,762
What it's capable of?
Do you have any idea?

400
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,241
Where is he?

401
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,051
- Dear God, open that door!
- Get off <i>of</i> me!

402
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,680
What do you think you're doing?

403
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,604
You know the laws
about mistreating inmates.

404
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,808
If you harm one hair on his head...

405
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,245
Now, you stinking little stain!

406
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,483
I'm going to ask you politely,
one last time.

407
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,846
Where is he?

408
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,850
Ah, there you are.

409
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,762
<i>So, had enough time
to look over the property?</i>

410
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,690
It's what you're looking for?

411
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,208
Well, it's garish, ugly
and smells like piss.

412
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,160
Can't quite make out
whether it's bums or rats, but it's piss.

413
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,369
I'm a connoisseur
when it comes to eau de toilette.

414
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,010
As for the rides,

415
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,166
any innocent little child
getting on one could be maimed or worse.

416
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,209
So you don't like it?

417
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,290
Don't like it?

418
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,006
I'm crazy for it!

419
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,208
Okay, okay, that's great.

420
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,728
So the price, with what you've
mentioned, we can negotiate.

421
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,886
No need to, sure your price is steep,
but as I look around,

422
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,084
all I can see is I'll be making a killing.

423
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,927
And money? Not a problem.

424
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,006
Not anymore.

425
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,728
How'd it go? Did they like your act?

426
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,684
Well, they, uh...

427
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,649
They said they might call me.

428
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,728
I got nervous and blew a punch line.

429
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,761
Oh.

430
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,606
What do you mean, "Oh"?

431
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,882
I didn't mean anything.

432
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,011
Yes, you did,
the way you said "oh" like that.

433
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,850
Jesus, all I said was...

434
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,161
You said, "Oh."

435
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,856
As in, "Oh, so you didn't get the job?"

436
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,325
As in, "Oh, I should've known?"

437
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,767
As in, "Oh, so how are we going
to feed our baby?"

438
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,207
You think I'm not worried about that?

439
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,807
You think it's all a big joke to me?

440
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,401
I have to go up on stage

441
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,006
and nobody laughs.

442
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,889
And you think I don't care.

443
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,691
You think, you think...

444
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,883
Oh, God! Oh, God! I'm sorry!

445
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,808
I don't mean to take this out on you.

446
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,610
You're suffering enough,

447
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,649
being married to a loser.

448
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,364
- Honey, that's not...
- Yes, it is true.

449
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,689
I can't support you.

450
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,087
Oh, Jeannie.

451
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,051
Shh. It'll be okay.

452
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,567
The baby won't be here
for another three months.

453
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,291
Mrs. Berkis will let us slide
on the rent a little longer,

454
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,090
she feels sorry for me.

455
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,330
She hates me.

456
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,929
She comes out in the hallway to scowl
at me every time I take the stairs.

457
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,604
That smell like cat litter and old people.

458
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,042
I've just got to get you out of here
before the baby comes.

459
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,044
All I need is enough money
to get us set up in a decent neighborhood.

460
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,247
For crying out loud,

461
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,250
there are girls on the street
who earn that in a weekend

462
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,080
without having to tell a single joke

463
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,850
or blow a punch line.

464
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,447
Come here and stop worrying about us.

465
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,206
I love you, job or no job.

466
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,846
You're good in the sack
and you make me laugh.

467
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,296
<i>CARNY OWNER". Let me tell you something.</i>

468
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,368
You ain't going to regret
buying this place.

469
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,164
It ain't as bad as it looks.

470
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,443
I hope you're wrong about that.

471
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,929
Come on, a little spit and polish,

472
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,128
you'll have yourself
one hell of a carnival.

473
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,130
Oh, you are so right,

474
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,965
and thanks to your smooth salesmanship

475
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,125
and your silver tongue,
I'm completely sold.

476
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,645
Let's shake on it.

477
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,882
Sure, sure, it's my privilege.

478
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,611
Yes, yes, it is.

479
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,486
Who are they?

480
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,484
Spit and Polish, my attorneys.

481
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,644
They persuaded your partner
to sign over the deed about an hour ago.

482
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,928
The property's already mine.

483
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,524
I can see that you're happy about that.

484
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,125
Now, I must dash.

485
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,124
There's equipment to rent,
plus workers to hire,

486
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,124
and of course,
I need to secure my main attraction.

487
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,408
Uh, do feel free to stick around.

488
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,721
Your refreshments, Master Bruce.

489
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,607
Well, then, sir,

490
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,809
do you need my further assistance
or should I just go away?

491
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,365
That'll be fine.

492
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,126
Trying to figure out
what he intends to do.

493
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,248
It's almost impossible.

494
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,370
Excuse me if I find that comforting, sir.

495
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,846
I don't know him, Alfred.

496
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,330
<i>All these years and I don't know who he is
any more than he knows who I am.</i>

497
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,250
Are you sure of that?

498
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,641
What do you mean?

499
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,167
I mean don't underestimate him.

500
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,601
I don't and neither should he
underestimate me.

501
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,727
You can't save everyone, sir.

502
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,286
He drives me.

503
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,001
<i>How can two people hate so much
without knowing each other?</i>

504
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,647
I hate this. Whenever we jail him, I pray,
"Please, God, just keep him there."

505
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,285
And then when he escapes, it's,

506
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,920
"Please don't let him
do something too awful this time."

507
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,081
I hate it.

508
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,642
Dad, just once, could you leave
your work at the office and relax?

509
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,610
I made you some cocoa.

510
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,605
Thanks, but tonight
I could use something a little stiffer.

511
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,321
You know, I found that
Catwoman scrapbook you couldn't.

512
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,084
It was behind the wardrobe.

513
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,331
You really ought to let me work
out a filing system for you,

514
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,329
something like we use at the library.

515
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,571
Mmm-hmm.

516
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,641
Oh, look.

517
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,406
You've got paste squidging out,
don't get it on your pants.

518
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,961
Barbara, I swear,
you're fussier than your mother was.

519
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,244
That must be Colleen. She's early.

520
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,561
We're going to work out.

521
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,416
You'll have to entertain her
while I get ready.

522
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,649
Look at this one.
First time they met.

523
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,644
He was just robbing banks then. Remember?

524
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,929
What I remember is you describing
his white face and green hair.

525
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,242
I was just a kid,
scared the hell out of me.

526
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,805
I thought you'd be interested.

527
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,203
Yeah, well, I had some
really interesting nightmares.

528
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,401
Barbara!

529
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,446
<i>I wouldn't worry yet,
if I were you.</i>

530
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,841
It's just a psychological manifestation,

531
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,843
common among librarians.

532
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,367
<i>She thinks she's a coffee table edition,</i>

533
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,444
though I can't say much
for this volume's condition.

534
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,688
I mean there's a hole in the jacket

535
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,810
and the spine appears to be damaged.

536
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,169
You scum, I'll...

537
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,641
Will you?

538
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,849
Refreshing to hear, not by the book.

539
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,449
Speaking of which, this one won't be
walking off the shelf anytime soon.

540
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,207
In fact, the idea
of her walking anywhere seems remote.

541
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,160
But then, that's always
a problem with softbacks.

542
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,526
Oh, God,

543
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,889
literary discussions
can get so dry, can't they?

544
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,250
Finish the Commissioner, take him where he
needs to be and please, do be careful.

545
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,563
After all, he is topping the bill.

546
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,125
It really is a shame you'll miss
your father's debut, Ms. Gordon.

547
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,726
Sadly, our venue wasn't built

548
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,723
for the disabled in mind.

549
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,601
Why are you doing this?

550
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,569
To prove a point.

551
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,885
Here's to crime.

552
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,045
You see, I have a reason, a good one.

553
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,164
I have to prove myself...

554
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,802
As a husband and a father.

555
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,371
I mean, well, this isn't the sort of thing
I'd agree to do normally,

556
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,363
without an important reason.

557
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,761
Of course.

558
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,931
Did I ever tell you
I started out as a lab assistant?

559
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,366
Of course, I did, right?

560
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,848
<i>A good job, a real good job,
but my heart wasn't in it.</i>

561
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,240
So, I quit to be a comedian,
to make people laugh

562
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,482
because when they laugh, they feel good.

563
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,041
The thing is... They didn't.

564
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,480
Now I'm not feeling good.

565
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,041
That's why I'm here, for one big score!

566
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,248
Hey, can you try and be cool?

567
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,281
Sorry, I usually don't drink at lunchtime.

568
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,681
You're not lying when you say
we'll get away with it?

569
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,644
Nobody will know I was involved?

570
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,286
Not to worry, friend.
We'll take care of you.

571
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,201
We need your help getting into that
chemical plant you used to work in

572
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,362
and into the playing card company
next door.

573
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,688
It's your expertise we appreciate.

574
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,640
And to absolutely guarantee
ain't nobody connects you to the robbery,

575
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,084
you'll be wearing this.

576
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,723
Wait a minute,

577
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,803
I've seen that before in the papers.

578
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,808
That's the Red Hood's mask.

579
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,769
He raided that ice company last month.

580
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,649
Smarten up, wise guy.

581
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,370
There ain't no Red Hood.

582
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,047
Just a bunch of guys
like yourself and a mask.

583
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,771
Right, the most valued member of the crew,

584
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,440
he gets to wear it, no questions asked.

585
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,045
'Cause he needs the...

586
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,282
"He can't afford to be
connected to the job

587
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,250
"so he deserves additional anonymity."

588
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,526
Merits it.

589
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,122
Sure. That makes sense, right? That's you.

590
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,850
But there aren't any eye slits.

591
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,331
How am I supposed to see?

592
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,522
Well, therein lies the beauty.

593
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,684
Two-way mirrors,
just like the cops use, huh?

594
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,481
I don't know, I don't know.

595
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,489
That chemical plant...

596
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,530
I quit 'cause it creeped me out.

597
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,844
So grim and ugly,
it was getting under my skin.

598
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,128
But you know it
like the back of your hand.

599
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,406
Right.

600
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,130
But this ain't about you, though.

601
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,524
No. No, of course not.

602
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,285
Just this once,

603
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,124
then I can lead a proper life.

604
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,441
Exactly.

605
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,211
Can't make a nest
without breaking a few eggs.

606
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,883
That's funny.

607
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,202
No, it's cliche.

608
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,485
So, 11:00, Friday night,

609
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,401
friend?

610
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,563
Starting Saturday morning, I'll be rich.

611
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,929
Just trying to imagine that,
my life, completely changed.

612
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,563
Nothing will be the same...

613
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,730
Not ever again.

614
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,203
She'll never walk again.

615
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,966
I'm sorry.

616
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,685
Some woman found Ms. Gordon,
name of Colleen Miles.

617
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,682
She found the, uh, victim
in a state of undress.

618
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,480
Undress?

619
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,924
They didn't tell you?

620
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,411
Pretty sick, ain't it?

621
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,490
Leave us alone for a moment.

622
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,123
Barbara, I don't know if you can hear me.

623
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,241
Batman?

624
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,001
Batman.

625
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,242
He took Dad, he...

626
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,611
Oh, God! I remember.

627
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,247
Barbara, take it easy. It's okay.

628
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,004
No, no, it's not okay.

629
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,448
<i>He's taking it to the limit this time.</i>

630
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,887
You didn't see his eyes.

631
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,845
He said he wanted to prove a point.

632
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,168
Said Dad was top of the bill.

633
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,130
What's he going to do?
What's he going to do to my father?

634
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,562
Huh? What?

635
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,611
- Wait!
- Up!

636
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,642
Stop!

637
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,801
Up!

638
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,041
<i>GORDON". No, no!</i>

639
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,845
Don't, please.

640
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,570
Why are you doing this?

641
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,050
Where are you taking me?

642
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,361
- Down!
- What?

643
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,010
Down!

644
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,009
Please, tell me what I'm doing here.

645
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,650
Somebody!

646
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,926
<i>JOKER". Doing?</i>

647
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,926
You're doing what any sane man in your
appalling circumstances would do.

648
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,085
You're going mad.

649
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,362
I remember.

650
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,727
<i>I</i> wouldn't do that-

651
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,281
Remembering's dangerous.

652
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,001
I find the past such
a worrying, anxious place.

653
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,767
Yes, memory is so treacherous.

654
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,642
One moment you're lost in a carnival
of delight, childhood aromas,

655
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,882
<i>the flashing neon of puberty,</i>

656
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,089
all that sentimental candyfloss.

657
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,569
The next, it takes you
somewhere you don't want to be.

658
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,802
Somewhere dark and cold,

659
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,289
filled with damp, ambiguous-shaped things
you'd rather forget.

660
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,401
<i>Memories can be vile,
repulsive little brutes.</i>

661
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,450
Like children, no?

662
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,400
Barbara.

663
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,008
But can we live without them?

664
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,561
Memories are what our reason is based on.

665
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,644
If we deny them, we deny reason itself.

666
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,610
Although, what's wrong with that, really?

667
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,969
It's not like we're contractually
tied down to rationality.

668
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,370
There is no sanity clause.

669
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,931
So when you find yourself

670
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,447
locked onto an unpleasant
train of thought,

671
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,241
headed for places in your past
where the screaming is unavoidable...

672
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:24,167
Remember this, there's always madness.

673
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,641
You can just step outside,

674
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,765
<i>close the door on all
those dreadful things that happened.</i>

675
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,641
You can lock them away forever.

676
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,049
So, everything's
settled for tonight?

677
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,565
We can count on you?

678
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,442
Uh... Well, of course.

679
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,409
It'd be crazy to back out now.

680
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,930
I mean, the worst part,
lying to Jeannie, that's done.

681
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,284
She thinks I have a club engagement.

682
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,847
No reason she shouldn't
keep right on thinking that.

683
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,408
Now, about tonight,
wear a suit and a bow tie.

684
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,530
It's kind of the trademark
with this Red Hood business.

685
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,126
It's what Jeannie
will expect me to wear to the night club.

686
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,611
Ah! It's perfect.

687
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,891
Excuse me, sir?

688
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,520
Could we speak to you outside
for a moment?

689
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,801
Me? But why? I haven't, I mean, uh...

690
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,730
It'll only take a moment, sir.

691
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,608
Something you want to tell us, friend?

692
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,088
There was an accident this morning...

693
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,324
Testing the baby bottle heater.

694
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,125
An electrical short and my wife died.

695
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,529
Gee, that's terrible. We're really sorry.

696
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,930
The cops said it was
a million-to-one shot accident.

697
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,443
Said I should probably have another drink
before I went to the hospital.

698
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,761
And you should.

699
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,521
Rough break, man,
probably want to be alone, right?

700
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,801
That's cool.

701
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,604
We'll see you back here tonight.

702
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,281
Tonight?

703
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,046
I can't.

704
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,288
There's no reason anymore.

705
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,886
Jeannie's dead.

706
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,964
Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry about your wife,

707
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,930
but what's happening tonight,
it's no little thing.

708
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,646
And we can't ensure that
anybody backing out remains healthy.

709
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,883
- Uh, but...
- No buts and no exceptions.

710
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,964
Look, tomorrow you bury
your old lady in luxury.

711
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,083
Tonight, you're with us.

712
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,084
Get the picture?

713
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,929
I'm going to count to 10.

714
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,004
One, nine...

715
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,368
I swear to God, man, he ain't been around.

716
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,244
Swear to me!

717
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,369
You! I swear to you.

718
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,808
When he escapes, it ain't long till he
comes around, recruiting, you know?

719
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,122
But not this time. Nobody's seen him.

720
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,921
Yeah?

721
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,889
Step away from the door.

722
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,606
Oh, shit.

723
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,321
You done?

724
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,323
<i>- Yeah, I heard he got out again.
- You</i> heard?

725
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,086
Read.

726
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,490
Calm down, I have no idea where he is

727
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,847
or what in the hell
he's got planned, trust me.

728
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,490
I can't trust you.

729
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,444
No, but believe me.

730
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,450
If I knew anything, I'd tell you, honest.

731
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,051
People in my, uh...

732
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,531
Let's call it "line of work."

733
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,881
Criminals.

734
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,725
Yeah, we may be scared of you.

735
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,810
We're terrified of him.

736
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,647
Order in the court! Order in the court!

737
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,290
I'll have ham on rye.

738
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,084
It doesn't have to be good
to be a classic.

739
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,247
So, Commissioner, I need your help.

740
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,890
Is that why I'm here?

741
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,883
That's why you're here right now,

742
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,487
like right now, as in this moment.

743
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,405
Do me a favor and live in it, okay?

744
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,847
Anyway, me and my colleagues,
we couldn't come up with

745
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,321
one sound mind and body between us.

746
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,960
So, we're counting on yours.

747
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,323
What should be done with someone
who has no regard for the law?

748
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,801
- Yeah!
- He's right.

749
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,566
Someone who treats people like meat!

750
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,641
A man who has no problem
brutalizing his fellow man to get his way.

751
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,007
- Now, now.
- What would you do to a man

752
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,891
who breaks the laws
you are sworn to uphold?

753
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,169
A monster who ignores
everything you stand for!

754
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,961
Come on, is it that bad?

755
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,170
Yes, it is, and if it were up to me...

756
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,640
Right now, it is.

757
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,924
I'd throw the book at him.

758
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,241
Throw the book!

759
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,683
Throw the book!
Throw the book! Throw the book!

760
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,046
What are you waiting for?
Throw it! Throw it!

761
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,087
<i>Throw it! Throw it!</i>

762
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,526
Throw the book!

763
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,530
Right on target.

764
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,045
Truth is, Commissioner,

765
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,727
the man on trial here,
you consider your friend.

766
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,962
Nope, which is funny.

767
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,167
Funny?

768
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,926
Yeah, he usually comes
around here, right away.

769
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,525
Like before it's even on the news,

770
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,842
he broke out of the nuthouse again,
he's had a roll.

771
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,010
You'd think the most important
thing for him is to...

772
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,686
What?

773
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,409
Have a good time.

774
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,001
So, why do you think
he hasn't been to visit?

775
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,401
I don't know.

776
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,449
Maybe, he found himself another girl.

777
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,489
Hey, somebody wants you.

778
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,560
<i>Uh-uh-uh. No fair hiding.</i>

779
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,050
<i>Ugh. Well, I'd see why.</i>

780
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,567
<i>You don't look so good.</i>

781
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,162
<i>Well, I don't blame you, not when that
bowl of cherries some call life,</i>

782
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,170
<i>turned out to be the pits of hell.</i>

783
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,451
<i>Perhaps, a song might
bring a smile to your face.</i>

784
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,726
<i>When the world is full of care</i>

785
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,486
<i>And every headline screams despair</i>

786
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:08,090
<i>When all is rape,
starvation, war and life is vile</i>

787
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,810
<i>Then there's a certain thing I do</i>

788
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,804
<i>Which I shall pass along to you</i>

789
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,330
<i>That's always guaranteed to make me smile</i>

790
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,609
<i>Yes!</i>

791
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,242
<i>I go loony</i>

792
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,284
<i>As a light bulb-battered bug</i>

793
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,364
<i>(Simply 100")'</i>

794
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,126
<i>Sometimes foam and chew the rug</i>

795
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,727
<i>Mister, life is swell in a padded cell</i>

796
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,690
<i>It'll chase those blues away</i>

797
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,525
<i>You can trade your gloom for a rubber room</i>

798
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,081
<i>And injections twice a day</i>

799
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,404
<i>Just go loony like an acid casualty</i>

800
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,928
<i>Or a Moonie or a preacher on TV</i>

801
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:02,120
<i>When the human race wears an anxious face</i>

802
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,769
<i>When the bomb hangs overhead</i>

803
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,605
<i>When your kid turns blue</i>

804
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,411
<i>It won't worry you</i>

805
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,325
<i>You can smile and nod instead</i>

806
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,370
<i>When you're loony</i>

807
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,251
<i>Then you just don't give a fig</i>

808
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,688
<i>Man's so puny</i>

809
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,161
<i>And the universe so big</i>

810
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,890
Barbara? No!

811
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,684
<i>If you hurt inside, get certified</i>

812
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,611
<i>And if life should treat you bad</i>

813
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,211
Barbara! Barbara!

814
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,967
<i>Don't get even, get mad</i>

815
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,361
Barbara!

816
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,886
Yes!

817
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,121
Ah, here they are now.

818
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,281
Holy Christ! That must be
the best ghost train in the business.

819
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,768
I mean, when they went in,
the fellow in the middle

820
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,247
didn't look a day over 17.

821
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,566
Well, that's what
a dose of reality will do to you.

822
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,241
It's why I never touch the stuff.

823
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,763
I find it waters down the hallucinations.

824
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,046
So, Commissioner, how's things?

825
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,923
Commissioner? Hello? Anybody home?

826
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,203
Oh. This wasn't supposed to
turn out boring.

827
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,842
Oh, put him away in his cage.

828
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,764
We're about to open for business.

829
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,283
Let's hope our main
attraction gets livelier.

830
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,444
Give him time to reflect upon life

831
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,764
and all its random uncontrollability.

832
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,081
<i>Hey, quit your
daydreaming, friend.</i>

833
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,366
<i>It's showtime.</i>

834
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,003
I was just remembering.

835
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,691
I used to walk along here
to work each morning.

836
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,649
Ah, that's good, real good.

837
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,484
That's just what we need you to do.

838
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,563
Just guide us through
this stinking factory

839
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,882
so we can get to the joint next door.

840
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,169
And stay far away from us
while we do the dirty work.

841
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,121
It's like we're practically giving you
money by cutting you in on this.

842
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,486
Right now?

843
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,165
Will I be able to breathe?

844
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,651
Not if you smoke.

845
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,850
That's a good one.

846
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,686
Maybe, I should be looking into your line
of work instead of you looking into mine.

847
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,770
You got a funny shaped head.

848
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,930
Maybe I should've been a clown
instead of a comedian.

849
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,322
There. You can see, friend?

850
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,127
<i>Yeah, but everything's red,</i>

851
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,251
stuffy too and it smells.

852
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,851
Ooh, my voice sounds echo-y.

853
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,606
Then shut up and get to work.

854
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,882
Okay, we go through here
past the filter tanks

855
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,089
and then Monarch Playing Cards
is just beyond the partition.

856
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,047
<i>You know this place looks
even worse in red.</i>

857
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,122
- It looks like...
- Hey, you! Freeze!

858
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,680
Come on, come on, get 'em up!

859
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,416
Murph, get some men over to the rear bays.

860
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,408
We're being robbed by the Red Hood Mob.

861
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,121
You asshole!
You said there was no security.

862
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,169
They must have altered things
since I left.

863
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,721
It's so loud.

864
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,929
For God's sake, run!
This is all screwed up, run!

865
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,401
Man, which way?

866
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,244
I can't see where I'm going.

867
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,289
You useless son of a bitch.

868
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,570
I'm not the guy you want.

869
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,007
It's him! He's our ringleader.

870
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,605
He's the Red Hood.

871
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,571
He's pulling a gun!

872
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,764
No, no, no, no, no!

873
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,481
Stop!

874
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,410
No more shooting.

875
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,923
I'll take care of this my way.

876
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,929
It's that human bat guy.

877
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,447
Dear God,
what did I do to deserve this?

878
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,125
<i>So, Red Hood,</i>

879
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,770
we meet again.

880
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:25,442
Stay away from me,
don't come any closer, you monster!

881
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,762
Uh, uh...

882
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,926
it burns!

883
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,964
I'm itching all over. What's...

884
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,727
<i>JOKER ON PA". Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

885
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,042
<i>although there doesn't
seem to</i> be <i>either</i> here.

886
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,680
<i>How about children of all ages?</i>

887
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,125
<i>You must have received your free ticket.
Oh, I'm so glad.</i>

888
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,643
Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages,

889
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,883
I give you the average man.

890
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,724
Impressive, eh?

891
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,450
Ooh!

892
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,721
Jim.

893
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,809
Jim, are you still...

894
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,846
Oh, God. Oh, God.

895
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,127
It's okay, let it come.

896
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,927
He showed me pictures of my daughter.
Have you seen her?

897
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,251
Yes, she's alive.

898
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,526
And?

899
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,444
The police are right behind me.

900
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,761
I'll stay with you, until...

901
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,287
No, I'll survive.

902
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,567
Go after him. I want him brought in.

903
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,722
And I want it done by the book.

904
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,164
By the book!

905
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,924
You have to!

906
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,529
We have to show him our way works.

907
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,882
<i>JOKER". Let me ask you something.</i>

908
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:01,489
<i>What does it matter if you send me back to
the asylum if it doesn't matter to me?</i>

909
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,290
I've proved my point.

910
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,209
Gordon's been driven mad.

911
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:12,122
<i>I've demonstrated there's no difference
between me and everyone else.</i>

912
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,041
<i>All it takes is one bad day.</i>

913
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,561
<i>That's how far the world
is from where I am,</i>

914
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,802
just one bad day.

915
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,484
<i>You had a bad day once, am I right?</i>

916
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,927
<i>Oh, I know I am.</i>

917
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,161
<i>I can tell.</i>

918
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:31,164
<i>You had a bad day and everything changed.</i>

919
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,643
<i>Dressing up like a flying rat
doesn't hide it, it screams it.</i>

920
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,366
<i>You had a bad day
and it drove you as crazy</i>

921
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,683
<i>as everybody else,
only you won't admit it.</i>

922
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,056
<i>GROANS}
- You have to keep pretending</i>

923
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,206
<i>that life makes sense,</i>

924
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,806
<i>that there's some point
to all this struggling.</i>

925
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,088
<i>You make me want to puke.</i>

926
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,442
Shh.

927
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,321
<i>I mean, what is it with you?</i>

928
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,131
<i>What made you what you are?</i>

929
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,240
<i>Girlfriend killed by the mob, maybe?</i>

930
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,323
<i>Brother carved up by some mugger?</i>

931
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,244
<i>Something like that, I know.</i>

932
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,643
<i>Because something like that
happened to me.</i>

933
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,485
<i>Sometimes, I remember it one way,
sometimes another.</i>

934
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,883
<i>If I'm going to have a past,</i>

935
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,885
<i>I prefer it to be multiple choice.</i>

936
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,045
<i>My point</i> is...

937
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,451
I went crazy.

938
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,240
And I'm smart enough to admit it.

939
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,529
Why Can't you?

940
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:48,525
By clinging to reality, you're denying
the reality of the situation.

941
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,400
I mean, do you ever think
about how many times

942
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,849
we've come close to World War III over
a flock of geese on a computer screen?

943
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,484
Silly goose, it's all a joke,

944
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:07,686
everything anybody's ever valued
or struggled for, it's monstrous.

945
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,684
Why can't you see the funny side?

946
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,969
Why aren't you laughing?

947
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,529
Because I've heard it before,

948
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,446
and it wasn't funny the first time.

949
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,044
I spoke with Commissioner Gordon
before I came in here.

950
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,647
He told me he wanted
this done by the book.

951
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,411
You know what that means?

952
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:43,246
It means that despite all your sick,
cruel, vicious little games,

953
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,528
he's as sane as he ever was.

954
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,564
So, ordinary people don't crack.

955
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,811
Maybe it's just you.

956
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,451
- No!

957
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,844
God damn it.

958
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,286
Well, what are you waiting for?

959
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,728
Kick the hell out of me
and get your standing ovation.

960
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,726
Come on!

961
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,368
No, not this time.

962
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,571
I don't want to hurt you.

963
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,685
I don't want either of us
to end up killing the other.

964
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,604
But we're running out of alternatives.

965
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,283
Perhaps it all hinges on tonight.

966
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:51,325
I don't know what it was
that bent your life out of shape,

967
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,051
but maybe I've been there, too.

968
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,164
Maybe we could work together.

969
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,084
I could rehabilitate you.

970
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,802
You don't need to be alone.

971
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,962
We don't have to kill each other.

972
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,164
Let me help you.

973
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,806
I'm sorry, but no.

974
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,082
No, it's far too late for that.

975
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,841
You know, it's funny.

976
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,289
This reminds me of a joke.

977
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,162
See, there were two guys
locked in a lunatic asylum

978
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,483
and one night, one night they decided
they didn't like that anymore.

979
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,165
They decided to escape.

980
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,856
So, they made it up to the roof and there,

981
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,247
just across this narrow gap,
they see rooftops,

982
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,529
stretching across town,
stretching to freedom.

983
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,326
Now, the first guy,
he jumps right across, no problem.

984
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:58,127
But his friend, no way,
he's afraid of falling.

985
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,248
So, the first guy, he has an idea.

986
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,330
He says,
"Hey, I got this flashlight with me.

987
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,528
"I'll shine it across the gap
between the buildings

988
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,411
"and you can walk across
the beam and join me."

989
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,131
But the second guy says,
"What do you think I am, crazy?

990
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,489
"You'll just turn it off
when I'm halfway across."

991
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,083
Excuse me.

992
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,126
Hmm.

993
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,724
Yeah, Dad, I just got back
from the lacrosse game.

994
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,687
Going to practice
some Wallball this weekend.

995
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,531
Getting pretty good.

996
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,167
Maybe another night, Dad,
I got plans tonight.

997
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,127
I can't help it
if your daughter's so popular.

998
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,125
I'll talk to you, later.

999
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,931
Right then, back to work.

1000
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,287
