  now it's Carlos's

who are unlike any other, the   
  only team of journalists      

604

that - they're father and son.

     minutes into it, I was     

608
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,812

   whole, it was like           

609
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:44,847
   the thing where your whole   
         body overheats,        

610
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,617
   and I started to feel like   
   asthmatic, which, probably   

611

 'cause I smoke too much, but it
     was just way too much.

  and after everything          

619
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,811
    we'd experienced here, it   
         was going to be

        here I was, with        

624
00:45:27,692 --> 00:45:35,298

    war zone, we reconnected.   

625
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,735

    as afather,                 

628
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:48,678
   I was relieved that Carlos   
        was headed home,        

629
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,781
