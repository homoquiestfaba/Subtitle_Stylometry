      what may have caused

155
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,829
            (laughs)

156
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:36,347
     (speaking in Spanish)

157
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,637
          -(growling)
          -(screaming)

158
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,645
       (Jesus screaming)

159
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:28,199
           (screams)

160

161
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,223
           (screams)

162
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,498
         (Jesus groans)

163
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,677
     (speaking in Spanish)

164
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,193
          (TV static)

165
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,529
          Yes, indeed.

166
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,600
      Zombies didn't stand
     a chance against him.

167
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,271
     May he be with us now
      in our darkest hour.

168
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,940
          -Right, Bob?
  -Bob:<i> Amen to that, brother.</i>

169
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,409
   Yes, Bob. Are you afraid?

170
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,444
  <i> Fucking freaking out man!</i>

171
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,113
        Good Bob, good.

172
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:28,486
       Keep rolling, Bob.
   At all cost, keep rolling.

173
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,822
    Mother fucking zombies.

174
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,559
     Ladies and gentlemen,
       stay tuned to KPRS

175
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,095
  for minute by minute reports
          and updates

176
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:40,197
       on how to survive
        in Zombieworld.

177
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:44,268
    And now, a public safety
         announcement.

178
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,504
     Announcer:<i> Have people</i>
 <i> around you began to change?</i>

179
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:49,273
    <i> Do they seem strange?</i>
   <i> Produce strange sounds?</i>

180
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,075
       <i> Oh, and want to</i>
       <i> eat your brain?</i>

181
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,477
   <i> Welcome to Zombieworld.</i>

182
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,947
        <i> How to survive</i>
     <i> a zombie apocalypse.</i>

183
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,316
           (whispers)
   <i> This can save your life.</i>

184
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,753
        (brakes screech)

185
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,192
   <i> The most important thing</i>
       <i> is not to panic.</i>

186
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,496
  <i> You are gonna have to kill</i>
        <i> some zombies.</i>

187
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,332
     <i> So, let's get to it.</i>

188
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,867
          <i> Thoroughly</i>
     <i> study the situation.</i>

189
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,170
    <i> Then, arm yourself.</i>

190
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,575
 <i> The zombies are pretty slow</i>
  <i> and unintelligent beings.</i>

191
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:27,611
 <i> But for some strange reason,</i>
        <i> in many cases,</i>

192
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:29,547
  <i> they catch their victims.</i>

193
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,949
<i> So be extremely careful.</i>

194
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,419
   <i> How to identify zombies,</i>
           <i> you ask?</i>

195
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,388
           <i> Usually,</i>
  <i> they are stumbling around</i>

196
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,090
   <i> holding a piece of limb.</i>

197
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,192
    <i> They are missing parts</i>
        <i> of their head,</i>

198
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:44,462
    <i> have sunken eyes, and</i>
 <i> produce a sound like this...</i>

199
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,364
        (groaning sound)

200
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,499
      <i> You can kill them</i>
  <i> by destroying their brain</i>

201
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:50,401
      <i> or blowing a hole</i>
         in their head.

202
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:53,738
      <i> If you use a gun,</i>
    <i> it is better to wait</i>

203
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,040
<i>until they get a little closer,</i>
      <i> to make sure that</i>

204
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,641
   <i> you will hit the target.</i>

205
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,643
   <i> But don't get too close.</i>

206
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,715
   <i> Shoot them in the head!</i>

207
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:09,620
       <i> And, as always,</i>
   <i> watch your surroundings,</i>

208
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,590
    <i> because zombies travel</i>
          <i> in packs.</i>

209
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,425
           (gunfire)

210
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,399
      <i> If you notice that</i>
        <i> zombies emerge</i>

211
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,900
   <i> from several directions</i>

212
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,870
    <i> the safest thing to do</i>
   <i> is to find a safe place</i>

213
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:27,671
    to assess the situation.

214
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,583
       <i> After assessing</i>
        <i> their number,</i>

215
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,253
    <i> quickly and thoroughly</i>
    <i> eliminate the threat.</i>

216
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:45,856
           (gunshot)

217
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,359
     <i> And one more thing:</i>

218
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,328
        <i> this requires</i>
        <i> serious music.</i>

219
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:59,437
 <i> If the city is overrun with</i>
           <i> zombies,</i>

220
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,972
    <i> there's a good chance</i>
     <i> that the government</i>

221
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:04,108
 <i> will order the sterilization</i>
        <i> of that city.</i>

222
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:14,051
       <i> See what I mean?</i>

223
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:18,589
<i>Good evening, I'm Marvin Gloatt</i>
      <i> and this is KPRS.</i>

224
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,624
       <i> The only station</i>
     <i> you will ever need.</i>

225
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,194
 <i> The only station you've got.</i>

226
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:28,299
  We are reporting on day nine
   of the zombie apocalypse.

227
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,867
       And we won't stop.

228
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,603
    Ladies and gentlemen,
    we are receiving reports

229
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,505
  that the freeways are jammed

230
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,273
     with people trying to
          leave town.

231
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:39,543
         This is a bad,
     I repeat, a bad idea.

232
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:42,513
        As I've already
      exclusively reported

233
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:44,482
    in my exclusive reports,
      this appears to be a

234
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:47,351
        global epidemic,
       and not contained

235
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,653
  only to a few cities in the
   United States of America.

236
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,991
  Please, remain indoors until
  the situation is contained.

237
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:56,627
     Please keep doors and
        windows bolted

238
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:58,762
  until instructed otherwise.

239
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:00,764
     -KPRS will continue--
    <i> -</i> Bob:<i> Oh, my God, no!</i>

240
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,733
 <i> -Marvin, he got in. Marvin!</i>
           -Damn it!

241
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,702
  <i> I want to stay here. He is</i>
   <i> here, I got him. No, no!</i>

242
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:08,105

        <i> Oh no, Marvin!</i>

    <i> Marvin, are you okay?</i>

248
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,051
           I got it.

249
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,521
  <i> Marvin! Oh my God, Marvin!</i>

250
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,122
       Keep rolling, Bob!

251
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,957
          <i> -Rolling.</i>
     -Don't leave me, Bob.

252
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,292
 <i> I'm with you until the end,</i>
           <i> brother.</i>

253
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:29,760
     I've got an axe, Bob.

254
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,330
    I've got a very big axe!

255
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:34,598
    <i> You got them, Marvin!</i>

256
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,137
  We take you now to Ireland,

257
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,172
      where zombie attacks
       are being reported

258
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,375
     on that Emerald Isle.

259
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,243
           (growling)

260
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,430
            (pants)

261
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,465
             Steve?

262
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:44,635
    I'm back from shopping.

263
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,471
 You won't believe the trouble.

264
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:51,809
              Oh.

265
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,946
  Craig from down the road...
           he's dead.

266
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:59,316
     So, I guess that's it.
We're the last two alive.

267
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,453
    They left the door open.

268
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:07,825
  Jesus, Steve, what happened?

269
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,860
       Well, obviously...

270
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:14,164
     Oh Christ, believe me,
   I don't want to be alone.

271
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,101
      I'm alone aren't I?

272
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:18,402
      There are no zombies
          in the flat.

273
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:19,637
        -(Steve murmurs)
           -Oh great!

274
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:23,140
         I'm all alone.

275
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:28,812
         I'm all alone.

276
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,683
     It's like last summer
 when you all went to Majorca,

277
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:34,385
    and I couldn't afford to
     so I had to stay home.

278
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,922
     I had all these things
            planned.

279
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:40,791
  Things I wanted to tell you.

280
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,326
      I was going to start
         with all the--

281
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:43,761
       all the bad stuff,
  just get it out of the way,

282
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:44,895
      get it off my chest.

283
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:51,201
      There was a time...

284
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,871
        ...atUniversity,
     just before we met...

285
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,875
  Do you remember when we met?

286
00:27:57,877 --> 00:27:59,209
            Standing
      in the dinner queue,

287
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,911
        we were the only
   two English people there.

288
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,781
      And then we ended up
 going to that meet and greet,

289
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:06,283
 only to find it was a bunch of
       God squaders. Huh!

290
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:07,951
     Me, you and a bunch of
          Christians.

291
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:10,320
 Hey, I'd love to see the look
    on their faces now, eh,

292
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,889
   what with all the zombies.

293
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:13,123
             I know
    they are always going on

294
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,858
     about the apocalypse,

295
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,894
but that's when God let all the
   good ones into the heaven

296
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:18,429
     and sent the bad ones
         down to hell.

297
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,765
 Maybe the whole world is bad.

298
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:23,967
          If you take
    the Ten Commandments

299
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,970
    as like the literal Word
      of God then, yeah...

300
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,306
   ...the whole world is bad.

301
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:32,109
    Maybe the bible bashers
      were right, I mean,

302
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,378
     you have broken a few.

303
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:36,313
           So have I.

304
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:37,815
        (exhales)

305
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,619
      It was on a Sunday,
      so that's one down.

306
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,956
I probably said, "Jesus Christ",
     while I was doing it.

307
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,559
  I don't remember worshipping
          a false god,

308
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,260
        but I can't say
      I definitely didn't.

309
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,396
  What classes as a false god
      these days, anyway?

310
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,997
 I mean I worship "the pussy".

311
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,666
  You know what I mean, but...

312
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:59,737
Oh, yes. Yes, "the pussy".

313
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:00,938
 But yes, it is not like it is
    a false god or anything,

314
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,842
       it is just like...
       well, "the pussy".

315
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,844
    So, its not a false god,

316
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,178
        it is just like
      an alternative one.

317
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:09,980
        (creaking)

318
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,015
 That will be the undead again.

319
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:15,085
    Hey, they'll not get in,
        don't you worry.

320
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,020
            (laughs)

321
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,756
          (door opens)

322
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:20,090
      Oh shit, I have left
    the door open. One sec.

323
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:27,931
             Idiot!

324
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:31,602
      Hey, this reminds me
         of that time,

325
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,103
      remember that party,

326
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:34,638
      when I put dog shit
      on the door handle?

327
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,373
      Ooh, that was funny.

328
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,108
       Not for the people
       with shitty hands.

329
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:40,410
         Or dysentery.

330
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,678
      But man, I laughed.

331
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,047
 I remember, everyone thinking
    I was really rude,

332
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,883
  for not shaking their hands,
        but I knew best.

333
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,885
    Ho ho, man, did I know.

334
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,722
   Anyway, that's when I told
       Dave about your...

335
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,291
  ...your thing. what was it?
          That secret?

336
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,460
      I remember it being
    really important to you,

337
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:57,895
     but I don't know why.

338
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,730
  Maybe that's why I told him.

339
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,965
i know you never liked Dave.

340
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,400
         -(spluttering)
       -But I was wasted,

341
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,736
      and I was on a high
  from the dog shit gag, so...

342
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,207
           (coughing)

343
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,045
         (spluttering)

344
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:17,981
           I guess...

345
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:20,884
  ...the band is not going to
         take off now.

346
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:24,822
  As soon as the zombies came,

347
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:26,023
           I knew...
     I knew it wouldn't...

348
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,859
        Well, as long as
  you were there, I thought...

349
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,830
 I thought I'd have an audience
           at least.

350
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,935
       I know you thought
 I was talentless, little kid,

351
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:39,870
       but you listened.

352
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,105
      You even didn't mind
         when I played

353
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:44,374
 on your first date with Katie.
          She is dead.

354
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:46,710
      I used to fancy her.

355
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,379
       I spied on you two
        having sex once.

356
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,582
  Oh... she had awesome tits.

357
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:55,052
        (sighs) I wish,
     I had filmed that now.

358
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,119
     It would have given me
       something to watch

359
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,588
     during the apocalypse.

360
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,891
      I never had anyone.

361
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,896
     Tried to find a girl,
  but I always scared them off

362
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:07,297
    because I was too keen.

363
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:12,402
      All I wanted was...
    was someone to like me,

364
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:13,937
         to notice me.

365
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,774
      Who will laugh at my
       stupid jokes now?

366
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:25,549
       I guess I've been
    a bit of a shit friend.

367
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,719
       Maybe I should've
        apologized early

368
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:29,920
   when you could understand.

369
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,559
   Where is my rounder's bat?

370
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:37,928
   It better not be your room
         again, you...

371
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,730
        Oh, it's there.

372
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,940
     I can't do this alone.
     I want my friend back.

373
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:52,576
   I need someone to tell me
           to grow up

374
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:53,911
     and stop being a dick.

375
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,612
       Someone to show me
      how all this works.

376
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:57,748
            Yeah...

377
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,751
      I know I annoyed you
        sometimes, mate

378
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:02,619
         and sometimes
        you annoyed me.

379
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,688
    You were always going on
   about how good your job is

380
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,456
  and how much better in life
     you do than me, but...

381
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,126
      ...I didn't mind...
 I didn't mind, mate because...

382
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,030
          What's this?

383
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:15,565
      What's this? A note?

384
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,338
       "Chris"... For me?

385
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:29,279
          "Dear Chris,
    this is my suicide note.

386
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,983
       I'd rather become
       one of the undead

387
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:35,052
      than spend the rest
      of my life with you

388
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:38,555
    and your stupid guitar.
          I hate you.

389
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,657
     And hope the zombie me
           eats you.

390
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,292
            Steve."

391
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,196
          (screaming)

392
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,837
         It looks like
    you're not only the one

393
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,006
     who does best in life
      after all, you dick!

394
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:57,407
             (thud)

395
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:58,475
          (TV static)

396
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,013
         This just in.

397
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,649
     Ladies and gentlemen,
  we are receiving a live feed

398
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,651
        from a Quickstop
    on Broadway and Carter.

399
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,519
     That location is only
          three blocks

400
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,388
       from the station.
           I repeat,

401
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,524
      this is a live feed
        from a Quickstop

402
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:18,161
       only three blocks
 from this reporter's location.

403
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:21,765
    Police officer:<i> Unicorn.</i>
        <i> Whiskey. Kilo.</i>

404
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,033
             (beep)

405
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,241
       (car door closes)

406
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:38,115
     Police officer: Ma'am?

407
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,051
          -(knocking)
            -Ma'am?

408
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:44,054
  Ma'am, roll down the window.

409
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:46,823
  Woman: (sobbing) Please help
      my husband, please.

410
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,392
             -What?
 -Please! I need an ambulance!

411
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:50,227
        -What happened?
          -Oh, my God!

412
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,195
        Holy shit, okay.
     Tell me what happened?

413
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,064
          -Calm down.
 -They just started biting him.

414
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:57,167
     They who? Who bit him?

415
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:58,802
        How many people?

416
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:00,871
            -Please.
          -Oh, my God.

417
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,072
           (sobbing)

418
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:03,373
           Holy shit!

419
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,842
  Bravo 232, I need immediate
       medical attention

420
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,411
        at my location.
     I got a mid-thirties,

421
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:09,312
      severe lacerations,

422
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,048
     and a large amount of
          blood loss.

423
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,083
      Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

424
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:16,053
        -Woman: No! No!
      -Ma'am, okay. Okay.

425
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,220
   Everything is going to be
             okay.

426
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,488
          -Calm down!
              -No!

427
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,058
         Ma'am, relax.
     Relax. Breath. Breath.

428
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,060
       (hysteric sobbing)

429
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,861
     The medicals on route,
     you got to calm down.

430
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:26,229
            -Please.
        -Just calm down.

431
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,398
            -Please.
       -Ma'am, calm down.

432
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:30,100
   Everything is going to be
okay. All right? What the fuck!

433
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,069
             -Stop!
        -(screaming) No!

434
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:34,404
          -Stop! Stop!
          -Oh, my God!

435
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,474
       (muffled screams)

436
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:39,676
           (gunshot)

437
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:42,746
      (breathing heavily)
         Oh shit. Fuck.

438
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:44,815
             Ma'am?

439
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:48,518
     We've got shots fired.
       Shots fired, 232.

440
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,520
      I need medical now.
      Ma'am stay with me.

441
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,122
     Stay with me. Stay...

442
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:53,523
   Police officer over radio:
 <i> All units respond to... 185,</i>

443
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,025
<i> Sinclair station, code three.</i>

444
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,427
       (heavy breathing)

445
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:01,965
       Ma'am? Calm down,
  stay with me. Stay with me.

446
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,101
  Stay with me. Stay with me.
         Stay with me.

447
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:06,103
    Medical, I need you now.

448
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,774
      Stay with me, ma'am.
         Stay with me.

449
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:13,110

00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,888
    where citizens have been
instructed to remain indoors...

618
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:56,325
     ...and to use caution
 should they come into contact

619
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:57,893
        with the undead.

01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:13,114

788
01:08:06,116 --> 01:08:09,084
       Perhaps it's best
    if I just stay out here.

789
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:11,519
        Don't be silly.

790
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:14,689
    Our old postman used to
   always come in for a soda.

791
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:15,957
      Aren't you thirsty?

792
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:21,029
Well, it sure is awful hot out.

793
01:08:36,313 --> 01:08:38,146
     I'm not that thirsty.

794
01:08:50,393 --> 01:08:53,061
       Expecting guests?

795
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:56,731
            Guests?

796
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:59,100
   That would be a blessing.

797
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:01,169
  Every day for the last year,

798
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:04,305
    she's been making me set
           these out.

799
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:08,576
   She just can't accept that
         they are gone.

800
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:11,880
          So, you are
     not expecting guests?

801
01:09:12,616 --> 01:09:15,517
           A year ago

802
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:17,819
          on a day...
     just like this one...

803
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:24,325
        Her husband and
  his younger brother were...

804
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:26,161
      working at the mine.

805
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:28,229
 Just like they did every day.

806
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,168
  They were deep underground,

807
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,837
        working the lead
       on a new tunnel...

808
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,205
   when something went wrong.

809
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:46,948
        One of the men,
    his hands wet with sweat

810
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:50,018
     dropped his pick axe.

811
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,720
        When it landed,
    the steel from the blade

812
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:54,189
hit the tiniest piece of flint,

813
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:57,058
      hidden under a rock.

814
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,661
    The spark from the flint
      hit a bit of hay...

815
01:09:59,663 --> 01:10:03,231
   thrown down to absorb oil
     from a broken lantern.

816
01:10:03,233 --> 01:10:07,535
    It quickly caught ablaze
         and burned...

817
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,205
   in a straight line towards
   a nearby box of dynamite.

818
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:16,110
         It took weeks
        to dig them out.

819
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:23,551
     And when their twisted

820
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:26,588
      and lifeless bodies
      were finally found,

821
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,690
   they were so badly mangled

822
01:10:28,692 --> 01:10:30,358
      that my uncle could
       only be recognized

823
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,093
      by his wedding ring.

824
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,265
           Sometimes,
     when I see the drinks

825
01:10:37,267 --> 01:10:40,568
   sitting there, I forget...

826
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,638
      I expect to see them
          walking up,

827
01:10:45,342 --> 01:10:48,710
        hear them laugh,

828
01:10:48,712 --> 01:10:51,679
    have them tease me about
         my duck feet.

829
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:59,254
        Oh, I'm so sorry
   to have kept you waiting.

830
01:10:59,256 --> 01:11:01,923
  I needed to freshen up a bit

831
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,392
       before my husband
          comes home.

832
01:11:04,394 --> 01:11:07,428
    He and his brother work
  the early shift at the mine.

833
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:12,100
       Are you to be our
    new postman, Mister...?

834
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:15,136
            Nuddle.
    Frank Nuddle, yes ma'am.

835
01:11:15,138 --> 01:11:19,440
    If I could just get your
     signature right here.

836
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:22,310
          Oh I see...

837
01:11:22,312 --> 01:11:25,413
       this is addressed
         to my husband.

838
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:30,652
      His name is Ashley.
    Often causes confusion.

839
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:34,188
 If you could just wait a bit,
    he will be home shortly.

840
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:40,495
             Yes...

841
01:11:40,497 --> 01:11:42,764
          yes, indeed.

842
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:46,267
           You know,
    I think it would be okay

843
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:49,470
      if you sign for him
being as you're married and all.

844
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,306
 If I could get your signature
          right here,

845
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:53,508
      I will be on my way.

846
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:56,511
 I still have a few more houses
           to visit.

847
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:59,847
          -(laughing)
     -(dog barking outside)

848
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:02,417
      Oh, here he is now.

          (screaming)

850
01:12:50,233 --> 01:12:52,400
         Hi sweetheart.

851
01:12:52,402 --> 01:12:54,369
    Who was that odd fellow?

852
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:56,237
   That was our new postman.

853
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,473
          I don't know
       what got into him.

854
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:00,575
          One minute,
he was asking me for a signature

855
01:13:00,577 --> 01:13:03,411
      and the next he ran
   screaming from the house.

856
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,446
              Hmm.

857
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:09,917
     (dog barking outside)

858
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:14,589
 I... I suppose it was the dog.

859
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:18,059
      He said he has had a
      horror of them ever

860
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:21,763
 since the Battle of the Bulge

861
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:23,398
     trapped in the middle
          of the night

862
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,867
        in the Ardennes,
      10 feet up the tree.

863
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:28,403
   Surrounded by the pack of
       vicious beasts...

864
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:30,204
     sure that any moment,
      their barking would

865
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:32,840
      bring the Nazis and
 that moment would be his last.

866
01:13:35,178 --> 01:13:37,445
     Enough to make anyone
       lose their nerve.
