1
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,360
human beings closest encounter before death

2
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,400
I lie in the Coffin

3
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,600
whilst rites are being performed

4
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,280
but I am not dead

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,400
this is a Thai custom

6
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,560
to bluff the god of death

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,560
to dispel bad fortunes

8
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,920
difficult for lots of people to believe

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,760
but I believe

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,080
and not only me alone

11
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,440
today,in a thai province,thousands gather for a strange ceremony

12
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,800
to lie in a coffin to rid one of bad fortunes

13
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,280
bullshit

14
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,640
After the coffin ceremony

15
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,840
I can feel the bad luck

16
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,320
leaving mine body

17
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,360
when I leave the coffin

18
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,680
I feel that life has a new meaning

19
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,080
My daughter was in coma

20
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:49,520
I wrote her name on paper and prayed in the coffin with it

21
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,560
She woke after a week even doctors call it a miracle

22
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
my mother had stomach cancer

23
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,520
we tried all types of cure to no avail

24
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,400
that is why I brought her here

25
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,240
she will become better after it

26
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,320
tens of thousands attend it over the 3 days

27
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:23,400
making it the world's biggest live burial and Guiness record

28
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,820
when are you coming back to Hong Kong

29
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,240
everybody is in a panic about it

30
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,240
cannot have a wedding without a bride

31
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,360
Mariko

32
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,280
Mariko

33
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,560
close your eyes and now open it

34
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,440
you don't like it

35
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,800
why do you draw it with those piercing eyes

36
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,920
very penetrating

37
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,040
this is the beauty of it

38
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,320
1.2.3.4. contact

39
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,880
no pulse

40
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,000
no blood pressure

41
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,960
contact

42
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,440
his pulse is back

43
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,240
below 98

44
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,160
how long did his heart stopped

45
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,160
6 minutes 42 seconds

46
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,240
not possible

47
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,840
you sure?

48
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,040
affirmative

49
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,640
what happened?

50
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,440
why am I here?

51
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,880
You became sick during the ceremony

52
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,800
no heartbeat when to the hospital

53
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,400
but you seem alright now

54
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,000
the burial ceremony

55
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,400
stay calm

56
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,600
don't get up now

57
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,640
he thinks you regreted, are you?

58
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,720
the wedding ceremony is next week

59
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,680
are you feeling better now....yes

60
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,400
you look like you're half dead

61
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,400
how do you know I am here

62
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,920
looks like an emergency

63
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,720
we will always contact your best friend

64
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,880
you must have checked my phone contacts

65
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,760
dont be too cleaver when you are sick

66
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,720
how do you feel

67
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,320
I am okay

68
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,280
what did the doctor say

69
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,680
very series depression disorder

70
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:11,840
resulting in serious illusions and mental disorder

71
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,800
the last part, I added in

72
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,920
I never knew you belief in coffin ceremony

73
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,520
it is because of Nariko

74
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,200
I did what I had to do

75
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,320
after all, nothing to lose

76
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,600
think of yourself, don't do it again

77
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,080
unless......

78
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,800
there are pretty attendants ..

79
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,400
I get the attendants to get you something to eat

80
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,120
and give me a jab as well

81
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,760
Mike

82
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,840
your dinner's been heated up

83
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,200
are you okay?

84
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,840
Sue, come and help me

85
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,800
do I look like a bridegroom?

86
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,160
even your tie is not properly done

87
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,920
that's why you marry me

88
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,960

89
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,800

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,560
why do you agree to marry me

91
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,440

92
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,960
come on, give me a good reason

93
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
cause your dad is very rich

94
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,040
not a good reason

95
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,240
cause you're good in bed

96
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,160
even worse reason

97
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,160
cause you need somebody to take care of

98
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,040

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,880

found me card in your purse

102
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,760
why you never mentioned to me your coming to Thailand

103
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,320
sorry, it was a last minute decision

104
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,240
I understand you very well

105
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,680

You are very lucky

111
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,840
we were worried you would have broken bones

112
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,360
piercing your vital organs

113
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,360
I have seen all the x-rays

114
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,640

115
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,040
some external cuts, nothing to worry

116
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,920
anyway,it doesn't matter

117
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,360

118
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,160

119
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,840

135
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560

188
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,040

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,880
Mariko

196
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,800
Is she well?

197
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,080
still not stable

198
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,720
I need to spent time by her side

199
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,920
chris, we come empty to this world

200
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,840
and we will leave empty

201
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,480
It is the same woman

202
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,480
what?

203
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,280
the woman I saw

204
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,560
Is the same as what Nariko saw

205
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,360
impossible

206
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,240
I don't know

207
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,080
do you know who she is

208
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,480
maybe the coffin you laid in was her's

209
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,800
not possible

210
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,320
the coffins were new

211
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,280
you sure they use new ones

212
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,840
Ah Chan, thank you for meeting with us

213
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,360
It is my pleasure

214
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,360
I'm sorry to hear about your fiance's death

215
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,040
thank you

216
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:28,800
Unusual happenings with their coffin ceremony

217
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,000
I am not an expert

218
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,200
Every one have his curiousity

219
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,600
why did he die

220
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,120
this was taken less than 1 hour before his drowning

221
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,400
we went for excursion after our graduation

222
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,880
we raced to see who could reach the shore first

223
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,880
trying to impress the girls

224
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,080
he was chasing after me

225
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,560
suddenly he disappeared

226
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,640
at Joe's funeral ceremony

227
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,680
only his mother did not shed a tear

228
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,080
after his cremation

229
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,320
she told us the real reason

230
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:47,240
I cause the death of my son

231
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,520
I had stomach cancer

232
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,800
but I never mentioned to anyone

233
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,600
I don't want him to worry

234
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:53,840
the doctor said it was terminal

235
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:59,240
 it was terminal and I don't have long to live

236
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:05,320
later,someone told me about the coffin ceremony

237
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,720
I don't belief in these things

238
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,440
but then I thought, why not?

239
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,920
that is when I went to the ceremony

240
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,000
when death is right in front of you

241
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,080
you try to evade it

242
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,320
after the coffin ceremony

243
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,720
I did not feel any difference

244
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,720
but the doctor told me

245
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,600
my stomach cancer is gone

246
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,640
how do you explain

247
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,760
this and Joe's death

248
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,800
is there a relationship to it?

249
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,960
because on the day of Joe's death

250
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,800
the doctor told me this news

251
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,000
that my cancer is gone

252
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
do you know?

253
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,760
you cannot escape retribution and bad luck

254
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,960
you can only pass it on to your loved ones

255
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,000
auntie, are you better?

256
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,560
did you see it?

257
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,120
see what?

258
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,600
just a while ago..

259
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,920
honey!

260
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,880
honey!

261
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,360
my honey!

262
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,360
give me child back to me!

263
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,880
give my child back to me!

264
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,200
are you alright?

265
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:49,080
any connection to what is happening now?

266
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,480
I have collected a lot of information

267
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,320
recording what has really happened

268
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,600
Surachai....43 years old

269
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,200
colon cancer, went to the coffin ceremony

270
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,280
on 17 July 2004

271
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,000
was cured 1 week later

272
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,280
would have died if nothing miraculous occured

273
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,200
Suhontha,67 years old

274
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,560
went to coffin ceremony 27 April 2001

275
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,520
few days later, heart problem improved

276
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,280
but at the same time, grand daughter seriously injured

277
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,280
anybody encountered supernatural happening?

278
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,240
only one!

279
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,880
happened 5 years ago

280
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,280
but I cannot reveal too much about this case

281
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,800
unless someone has experienced it before

282
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,880
why did you go into forbidden area?

283
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,040
I saw a woman entering the area

284
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,760
No woman in the temple

285
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,040
only female ghost!

286
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,960
why do you look so pale?

287
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,880
nothing

288
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,480
how long have you been a grave caretaker

289
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,880
even before you were born!

290
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,320
taking care of the dead

291
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,400
makes me treasure my life

292
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,440
how many bodies have you cremated?

293
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,880
3248 including the one inside

294
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,400
did you cremated a woman and child recently?

295
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,280
I have booked tomorrow's ticket for you

296
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,680
thank you

297
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,120
remember our school days?

298
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,720
I dried your hair

299
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,520
sleep in the same room

300
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,360
eat instant noodles together

301
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,440
wear the same clothes

302
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,680
play truant together

303
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,680
fall for the same guy

304
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,320
sorry, talked too much

305
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,400
never mind

306
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,480
what I meant was

307
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,560
my dad died of liver cancer

308
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,160
I don't want to die the same way

309
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,040
I eat proper meals

310
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,040
took care of my health

311
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,000
I exercise everyday

312
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,200
follow the rules of good health

313
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,520
you are very well now

314
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,280
right but not Jack

315
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,120
Jack is dead

316
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,440
he died because of me

317
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,800
don't say that

318
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,680
I was thinking when I lie inside the coffin

319
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,080
why is it not Jack

320
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,880
he smokes everyday

321
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,960
why is it not Jack

322
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,760
it is not fair

323
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,680
I am sorry to hiim

324
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,920
its okay now

325
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,720
its okay now

326
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,040
let it be

327
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,080
I go to Hong Kong with you 

328
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,240
thank you

329
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,320
I enjoy it

330
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,080
I will go and change

331
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,280
you take whatever you want from the cupboard

332
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,480
what do you want from me?

333
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,680
what do you really want?

334
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,920
what do you want me to do?

335
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,440
I want to go and see Ah Chan again

336
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,840
please

337
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,240
Chris!

338
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,800
I cremated alot of bodies

339
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,800
never met with anything unusual

340
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,640
none we could not burn

341
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,200
if there is a preparation problem

342
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,880
like the burial door that is stuck

343
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,360
or the burner could not lit

344
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,640
or the coffin keep shifting

345
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,880
then we bury them here

346
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,720
they should be waiting for you

347
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,200
Chris?

348
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:38,760
Chris?

349
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,120
Chris?

350
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,120
No!!! Chris?

351
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,440
Chris?

352
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:54,760
Chris?

353
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,120
Chris?

354
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,120
Chris?

355
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,840
No!

356
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,240
Mariko?

357
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,080
Mariko!

358
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,680
Mariko?

359
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,480
 okay 

360
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,760
okay

361
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,160
what should I do now?

362
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,640
You lie in the coffin once more

363
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,640
death is not death, it is actually life

364
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,440
death before dying 

365
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,520
sawaadee khrap

366
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,640
how are you, Chris?

367
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,960
I am well

368
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,200
This is Nan

369
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,280
Sawaadee Khar

370
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,280
She is Sue

371
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,320
Ah Chan told me about your problems

372
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,320
my condolences

373
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,520
Chris, why is this happening?

374
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,880
Life keeps revolving nonstop

375
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,640
but was broken by us

376
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,400
how to resolve it

377
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,400
I haven't done anything

378
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,840
the night I found May's body

379
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,680
Mariko fell into coma

380
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,280
she's been in coma since 

381
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,240
she died 5 years ago

382
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,360
sorry, I did not know about it

383
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
it's all right

384
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,520
both my parents died when I was young

385
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,960
thinking of my loved ones leaving me

386
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,640
makes me feel more terrible than being dead myself

387
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,480
apologies

388
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,960
I could not help you much

389
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,960
you have been a great help

390
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,840
I am sorry, May

391
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,880
If I had known I will harm the both of you

392
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,800
I would not have joined the coffin ceremony

393
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,920
It's not Mariko's fault

394
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,160
he could have been a good man

395
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,120
when I got home

396
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,040
the house was on fire

397
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,200
I wanted to save him

398
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,680
but I failed to do so

399
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,600
you left me because of him?

400
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,000
If he is your child

401
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,840
I would have stayed behind

402
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,000
I am sorry

403
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,400
Chris....

404
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,000
I missed you

405
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,760
the same with me

406
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,600
I have to leave

407
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,880
will we meet again?

408
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:33,040
My cancer has returned

409
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,840
After the second coffin ceremony, my cancer returned

410
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,080
and I did not see Jack again

411
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,440
I have been under therapy for some time now

412
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,880
it has been unbearable

413
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,880
but life keeps revolving

414
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,200
I will not try to stop it again

415
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,680
Do I look like your bridegroom?

416
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:18,160
