1
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:37,089
- Mother.
- Good morning, darling.

2
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:40,764
I have a feeling you're trying
to tell me something.

3
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,038
Those were in you-know-who's
briefcase.

4
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:46,881
- So?
- Well, don't you care...

5
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,040
...if he carries pictures
of other women?

6
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:52,042
Mother, in the advertising business,
other women are merely...

7
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:54,882
...tools of the trade.
- Oh, blind faith...

8
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:57,563
...is unbecoming to you, Samantha.

9
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:00,801
Don't you understand?
I trust Darrin.

10
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:05,248
You wouldn't turn a child lose
in a candy store, would you?

11
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:07,718
Darrin is not a child.

12
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:09,442
Well, he's only human.

13
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:13,443
Isn't that the excuse they always make
for themselves, "I'm only human"?

14
00:01:13,889 --> 00:01:16,198
They know their limitations
better than we do.

15
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:19,600
Well, I don't think of Darrin
as being merely human.

16
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,365
I think of him as being a cut above
the ordinary mortal man.

17
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:28,081
How can a witch of mine be so naive?

18
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:29,921
Mother, will you please go away.

19
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:33,479
Very well, very well, I'm leaving.
But remember, Samantha...

20
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:38,848
...no mortal pulls the wool over
a witch's eyes while I'm around.

21
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:31,966
What are these doing here?
Thought I left them in my briefcase.

22
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:34,802
You better eat your breakfast.
You'll be late.

23
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,560
I've been looking at girls for weeks.

24
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:43,448
Yes, I suppose that could get tiring
after a while.

25
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:45,281
You're not kidding.

26
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:47,286
Which one do you like best?

27
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:50,646
- For what?
- Miss Jasmine, the perfume account.

28
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:53,403
Oh, yes. Of course.

29
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:54,922
Well, let's see, now.

30
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,163
This one has lovely eyes.

31
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,889
And this one has a beautiful mouth.

32
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,563
This one has a great figure.

33
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:05,886
Gee, I don't know.

34
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:08,199
Why don't you cut out
the best piece of each...

35
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:10,758
...and paste them together
like I used to do.

36
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:13,081
With paper dolls.

37
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:16,043
Look, I'm serious, Sam.

38
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,326
The campaign starts tomorrow,
and we haven't picked a Miss Jasmine.

39
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:23,880
Incidentally, we have to forget about
having lunch together today.

40
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:26,517
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, all right.

41
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:30,159
As long as you promise to have lunch
alone today and not enjoy it.

42
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,728
I'll do better than that.

43
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:34,687
I'll have lunch with Larry Tate
and really be miserable.

44
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,966
Better get going.

45
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:45,642
You better get going.

46
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:50,644
Okay. But remember,
you threw me out.

47
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:56,400
- So, what do you think?
- Marvellous. Incredible.

48
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,039
Some of the most gorgeous creatures
I ever laid eyes on, but...

49
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,599
...I still haven't seen that
je ne sais quoi...

50
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:06,567
...that ethereal quality we need
in a Miss Jasmine.

51
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:09,163
Courage, old friend. Don't lose faith,
we'll find her.

52
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,603
I know that.

53
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,408
I was just thinking about
going home to Louise tonight.

54
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:17,164
I don't know, after a week of looking at
these, it seems pointless somehow.

55
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,605
- Now, Larry, you've got a lovely wife.
- I suppose so.

56
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,283
If you'll excuse me, Darrin,
I'm going out to try...

57
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:25,246
...and wipe out the memory
of all this.

58
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:28,048
I never could stand too much
of a good thing.

59
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:45,448
- Yes?
- I hoped you'd say that.

60
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:48,760
- I beg your pardon?
- Aren't you looking for a Miss Jasmine?

61
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:52,041
I was. I mean, we are.

62
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:57,203
- Won't you sit down, Miss...?
- Janine Fleur. Thank you.

63
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:59,640
Have you done much modelling,
Miss Fleur?

64
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:02,039
I'm sure I could be
everything you want...

65
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:05,480
...in a Miss Jasmine, that is.

66
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:09,884
You might. Yes, you just might.

67
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:17,684
Hello, Larry? Can you come in here
for a minute?

68
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:19,328
Good.

69
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:31,845
- Is something wrong?
- Wrong? No.

70
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,398
You may solve a very big problem
for me, Miss Fleur.

71
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:37,720
- Janine.
- Well?

72
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:42,566
Well...

73
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:50,007
Well.

74
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:53,047
I'm thinking exactly
what you're thinking, Larry.

75
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,962
I won't say anything if you won't.

76
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:06,243
You've been very quiet tonight.
You have a bad day at the office?

77
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:08,805
Oh, it wasn't a bad day.

78
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,721
It wasn't a good day.

79
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:12,720
As a matter of fact,
it wasn't a bad day.

80
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,926
Well, don't commit yourself.
Anything new on Miss Jasmine?

81
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:19,688
- We found one.
- You did?

82
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,084
Oh, that's marvellous.
What's she look like?

83
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:25,564
- Attractive.
- Attractive?

84
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:28,038
You said you needed
something gorgeous.

85
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:30,359
Well, she's sort of gorgeous.

86
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:33,327
- She's blond, I'll bet.
- No, not really.

87
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:36,806
Well, what's she look like?

88
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,321
Tall, straight nose, experienced.

89
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:44,318
Well, that could be Abraham Lincoln.

90
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:45,683
I said she was pretty.

91
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,528
You said she was attractive.
There's a difference.

92
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:51,249
- What's her name?
- Janine Fleur.

93
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:54,082
Oh, sounds like perfume.

94
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:56,763
- Does she look like she sounds?
- You could say that.

95
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:58,760
I haven't seen her.
What do you say?

96
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:00,521
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

97
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:02,964
She sounds like perfume,
she looks like perfume...

98
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:05,438
...she even smells like perfume.
- You smelled her?

99
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:07,042
No, of course not.

100
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,440
Not deliberately. She's exactly what
Larry and I have been looking for.

101
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:13,004
Well, that's wonderful.

102
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,559
Now, how would you like to go to the
movies, eat popcorn and smooch?

103
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:18,965
I would love to...

104
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,482
...but I've got to work on some
exploitation ideas.

105
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:28,518
He's very evasive.

106
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:30,042
That shows interest.

107
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:33,207
He is only interested in that woman
because of business.

108
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:36,038
You'd better make it your business.

109
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:39,243
Did you notice that he kissed you
on your forehead?

110
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:42,919
The next thing you know,
he'll be patting your hand.

111
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:03,119
"Notes on Jasmine campaign:

112
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:09,166
Janine Fleur, measurements
37-23-37."

113
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:18,007
"Adjectives to be used in copy
describing her:

114
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:21,479
Provocative, dazzling, ethereal.

115
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:29,848
Personally supervise photographs
for campaign.

116
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:36,609
Get headshots featuring
her large, soft, dark eyes.

117
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:40,967
Get night shots at beach. Moonlight.

118
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:45,566
Janine holding perfume bottle
in her long, slender fingers.

119
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:49,119
Should be irresistible in a bikini."

120
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:58,838
- What happened?
- You were having a nightmare.

121
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:02,647
- Didn't seem like one.
- I say it was.

122
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,164
I know a nightmare when I see one.

123
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:07,638
Go back to sleep, dear.

124
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:42,404
- Well?
- I'd like to change her position a bit.

125
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:44,321
Figures.

126
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:47,845
Here, Janine, why don't you try your
hand here, stroking the bear's nose.

127
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:49,727
Thank you.

128
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,488
There you go.

129
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:55,163
You keep moving her around,
we'll be here all day.

130
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,399
I think we've got it now.

131
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:00,402
Hold it.

132
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,803
- Thank you. Is that lunch?
- Go ahead.

133
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:05,283
Lunch, Janine.

134
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:08,680
Oh, wonderful idea. I'm starving.
Where shall we go?

135
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:11,922
We? I'm afraid I can't.
I'm meeting my wife.

136
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:18,804
Well, I wouldn't ask you
or interfere, except that it's...

137
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:21,085
- Well, never mind.
- Well, what is it?

138
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:26,040
Well, it's probably foolish, but I think
you'd better get another Miss Jasmine.

139
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:28,360
Another Miss Jasmine? What for?

140
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,038
Now, hold it. I think we
better talk about this.

141
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:34,006
- But your lunch.
- I'll cancel it.

142
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:37,047
- Please don't do that because of me.
- My wife will understand.

143
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:40,565
She knows that at the moment the most
important thing is Jasmine Perfume.

144
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:44,483
- Go and change, and I'll give her a call.
- All right, I'll hurry.

145
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:52,521
Hello? Oh, hi, darling.
I was just leaving.

146
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:54,762
What?

147
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:58,002
Oh, no, no. I understand.

148
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:00,769
Yes, well, you go ahead.
I'll see you tonight.

149
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:03,484
Well, well, well.

150
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:06,288
All dressed up
and nowhere to go.

151
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:09,327
- I am going to have lunch with Darrin.
- Really?

152
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:11,320
One of these days
when he's not too busy.

153
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:13,878
- Oh, I understand, dear.
- No, you don't.

154
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,961
You think my husband is taking
another woman to lunch.

155
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:19,165
- I haven't said a word.
- Well, it's business.

156
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,718
Oh, yes, of course.

157
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,598
Well, I was going to suggest that
perhaps we could have lunch together.

158
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,760
Oh, certainly. You know
where Darrin is...

159
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:31,319
...so you're gonna bring me face to face
with him to prove your point.

160
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:32,922
- I never suggested it.
- I won't.

161
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:34,920
- Very well.
- I'll tell you what I'll do.

162
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:37,444
- What?
- I am going to take you there...

163
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:40,999
...and bring you face to face
with Darrin to prove my point.

164
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,402
Wait for me, Samantha.

165
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:10,003
Oh, isn't this delightful.
We must have a waiter. Waiter.

166
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:11,841
Menu.

167
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:13,962
Thank you.

168
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:21,365
- Mother, are you sure he's here?
- Quite sure.

169
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,403
Oh, they have Coquille St. Jacques.

170
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:28,719
They make it marvellously here.

171
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,368
Mother.

172
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:32,521
I don't believe it.

173
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:35,285
I'm sure I will.

174
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:37,246
Where is he?

175
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:46,803
I know this is upsetting
for you, darling...

176
00:12:46,969 --> 00:12:49,358
...but I'm not in the least surprised.

177
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:52,521
But, Mother, why?
I thought he was happy with me.

178
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,407
It's the spirit of conquest.

179
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:58,608
It's a disease of mortal men.
Like chickenpox.

180
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,444
Just a moment.

181
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:08,921
- That girl...
- I know how you feel, Samantha...

182
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,842
...but I do think we ought to leave
before they see us.

183
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:24,288
Now, Samantha! You're not going
to create a scene!

184
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:43,165
All right. Come off it, Sara.

185
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:45,889
Dignity, Samantha, dignity.

186
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:50,608
Well, hello, Samantha.
My, it has been a long time, hasn't it.

187
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,528
Sara Baker. I should've known.

188
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:56,408
She's one of us, Mother,
although I hate to admit it.

189
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,845
Just what do you think you're doing
with my husband?

190
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,323
Your husband?

191
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,600
Now, I heard you'd done
something foolish...

192
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:08,603
...but I never thought for a moment...
- You haven't answered my question.

193
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:11,078
Well, that must be obvious.
I'm Miss Jasmine.

194
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:17,078
Well, now, I must say I've had enormous
respect for Darrin's taste up until now.

195
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:19,963
Now, just a moment, blithe spirit.

196
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:23,360
Watch your tone, my girl,
you're speaking to my daughter.

197
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,602
Oh, really? Well, now, look
who's suddenly so concerned.

198
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:30,478
- What does that mean?
- Pay no attention to her.

199
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:35,359
You seem terribly solicitous for
someone so anxious for me to test...

200
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,281
...your mate's mettle.

201
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:39,843
Mother!

202
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:43,126
If there's one thing I cannot abide,
it's a stool pigeon.

203
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:46,884
What did you think you'd prove
by siccing this broom rider on Darrin?

204
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:51,604
Easy, Samantha.
Be careful what you say.

205
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:53,760
Well, you haven't proved a thing.

206
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:56,443
Even Sir Galahad
wouldn't be safe with her.

207
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:57,883
That's better.

208
00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:01,086
Now that this masquerade is over,
I trust it won't be necessary...

209
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:02,921
...to ask you again.

210
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:05,239
Stay away from Darrin, Sara.

211
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:07,363
Is that clear?

212
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:11,525
Well, she certainly is sensitive,
isn't she?

213
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:14,249
Pity, I was just starting
to enjoy myself.

214
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:17,765
I appreciate your efforts
on my behalf, Sara Baker...

215
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:20,079
...but now you'll do
as my daughter asked.

216
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:24,248
You know how difficult it is for me to
leave something unfinished, Endora.

217
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:26,321
Force yourself.

218
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:31,608
All of us at McMann & Tate
are behind you 100 percent...

219
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:34,158
...to make you the best
Miss Jasmine there ever was.

220
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:36,923
- I want you to believe that.
- I do believe you, Darrin...

221
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:39,125
...and I won't think about
leaving again.

222
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:42,281
You wouldn't want me to start
something I couldn't finish?

223
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:45,680
Of course not. I want...

224
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:49,448
Where did all the time go?
We haven't even had our lunch.

225
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:50,883
We'd better get back.

226
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:54,121
- We'll talk about this some other time.
- Oh, yes, indeed.

227
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,688
Some other time.

228
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:57,968
Waiter.

229
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:04,122
Hello?

230
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:07,122
Oh, hello, darling. How are you?

231
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:09,128
You're not?

232
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:11,566
Yes, dear.

233
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:13,123
Business.

234
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:14,642
Miss Jasmine.

235
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,277
Oh, I understand.

236
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,800
No, I'm fine.

237
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:21,807
Yes, sweetheart.

238
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:23,721
See you later.

239
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:30,687
- She won't give up, eh?
- That home-wrecking harpy.

240
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:32,840
Professional pride, I suppose.

241
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:36,445
She's not gonna get away with it.
I'm gonna tell Darrin that she's a witch.

242
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:40,238
I wouldn't try to convince him
he's susceptible to witches, Samantha.

243
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:43,242
I never used one single spell
on Darrin.

244
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,082
You may have a difficult time
convincing him of that.

245
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:49,083
Mother, what am I going to do?

246
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:51,479
You have no choice.

247
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:56,959
I guess not. I suppose every woman
has to face this at one time or another.

248
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:00,360
Darrin will just have to be on his own
with no help from anyone.

249
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:04,158
- Yes, but, darling...
- And so will I.

250
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,480
- All finished?
- Almost.

251
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:16,765
How are things coming
with Miss Jasmine?

252
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:18,840
I think we're getting
some good layouts.

253
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:21,443
Fine. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

254
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:24,207
Where you going?

255
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,127
- Home.
- Do you have to?

256
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:30,359
- Yes.
- Louise is waiting for you, I suppose.

257
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:34,523
Well, is it urgent that you go home
right at this minute?

258
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:37,278
Not if you have somewhere else
for me to go.

259
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:39,326
- I do have.
- Where?

260
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:40,922
Janine Fleur's apartment.

261
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,520
- Really?
- With me.

262
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:48,799
- Why?
- I've got business to take care of...

263
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:52,928
...with Janine, and I'd rather not
do it alone.

264
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:55,923
I brought Larry along to approve
some of these changes...

265
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:58,000
...you asked me to come over
and make.

266
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:01,127
Yes, of course. May I fix you
both a drink?

267
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,007
- Yes, thank you.
- No, thank you.

268
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,443
Just a little one.

269
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:06,567
Well, fine.

270
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:12,360
Larry, these television spots
need a little...

271
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:14,767
Larry.

272
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:19,239
Oh, yes. They certainly do
need a little. Yes.

273
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:24,363
- I was going to say "fixing."
- I'm not arguing with you.

274
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:27,321
There you are.

275
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:29,844
Well, here's to your
very good health, Miss Fleur.

276
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,920
- Of course.
- Thank you.

277
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:37,480
- Are they all right?
- Mine's wonderful.

278
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,209
I think I'll lay down and take a nap.

279
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:44,158
Meantime, I'll take care of Janine.

280
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:48,240
Isn't it getting crowded in here?

281
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:51,685
Sara, I'm going to lay it
right on the line with you.

282
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:55,637
I love my husband, and I also have
a great deal of faith in him.

283
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:59,040
Oh, is that why you're here?
Looking after him?

284
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:01,006
He can take care of himself...

285
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:03,603
...as long as you don't pull
anything fancy.

286
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,521
I don't know what you're
talking about.

287
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:07,839
Oh, of course not.

288
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:13,603
He was suddenly bitten
by a tsetse fly.

289
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:21,407
Samoan lotus leaf. Now, at least
let him act of his own free will.

290
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:23,525
I thought you had
more pride than that.

291
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:26,920
Believe me, Samantha,
I have no need of help.

292
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:29,478
If I'm going to lose Darrin
to something like you...

293
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:31,367
...it's better that I find out now.

294
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:35,803
Remember what I said.
His own free will.

295
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:39,598
And go over the papers right away.
Is that all right with you, Larry?

296
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,802
- Oh, sure.
- Why don't we sit over here.

297
00:19:43,969 --> 00:19:47,962
- The light's a bit better.
- Oh, fine. Come on over, Larry.

298
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:49,767
All right.

299
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:03,157
Yes, here we are.
Now, in this first set-up...

300
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:08,438
- Why don't you go on home, Larry.
- I'd be glad to.

301
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,964
Two's company
and three's a crowd.

302
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:20,726
- Where you going, Larry?
- Home, I think.

303
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:22,117
Well, what for?

304
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,042
I don't know, but I don't think
it was my idea.

305
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:28,765
- Well, wait for me, will you?
- Sure.

306
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:31,601
I think I need another drink.

307
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:39,244
All right, now, I think
the dialogue that...

308
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:42,048
...probably gives you the most
trouble is on page three.

309
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:46,122
- You're absolutely right.
- It seems to me, if you said:

310
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:50,077
"Jasmine introduces a new sensation"
rather than "a new essence"...

311
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,844
...that might make it easier.
Wouldn't you say so, Larry?

312
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:55,681
Larry?

313
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:00,639
That's the strangest thing
I've ever seen. He keeps going to...

314
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:04,484
- Kiss you.
- What did you say?

315
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:08,284
I said, I wanna kiss you
more than anything else in the world.

316
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:10,883
Go ahead.

317
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:14,122
What in...?

318
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:17,768
That wasn't funny, Samantha.

319
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:20,079
Well, I warned you.

320
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:28,684
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd just
as soon keep my husband alive.

321
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:31,443
Get out of here, or I'Il...

322
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:33,725
You'll what?

323
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:38,842
You know what I'm capable of doing.

324
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:41,204
I'd say we were pretty
evenly matched.

325
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:43,837
Sort of reduces this to
the human level, doesn't it?

326
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:45,840
How would you like
a poke in the nose?

327
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:50,207
- I'm not a brawler.
- I didn't think so.

328
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:52,485
Pardon the intrusion.

329
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:03,399
- What did you do that for?
- I'm sorry, Darrin.

330
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:05,925
It slipped.

331
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:08,440
Never mind, I probably had it coming.

332
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:10,804
- What happened to you?
- Nothing, where were you?

333
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:12,800
I think I took another nap.

334
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:16,484
- I feel great.
- I'll see you tomorrow, Janine.

335
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:18,605
But, Darrin, we have things
to talk about.

336
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:22,478
I don't mind breaking dinner dates with
my wife for something important...

337
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:25,721
...but there's nothing here
that can't be fixed down at the office.

338
00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:27,686
- Are you coming, Larry?
- You run along.

339
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:30,727
You're absolutely right. Samantha
must be concerned about you.

340
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:33,040
Suit yourself. All right.

341
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:40,244
Well, now, Miss Fleur, suppose
we talk about your problems.

342
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:43,363
Now what?

343
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:46,561
I realise that this is none
of my business, Sara...

344
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:50,642
...but Louise Tate happens to be
a very dear friend.

345
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:55,722
Some other time.
My wife is waiting for me too.

346
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:59,043
Oh, yes, if you can't stay,
I understand.

347
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:02,363
Then I wish you'd explain it to me.

348
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:16,081
Come in.

349
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:19,248
- Hello, darling.
- Hi, sweetheart.

350
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:23,004
This time I didn't take any chances.
I didn't phone, I just came right down.

351
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,637
I've got it written on my calendar
in big red letters:

352
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:28,607
- "Lunch, my wife, urgent."
- Good.

353
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:33,082
- Oh, is that Miss Jasmine?
- Yep, that's her.

354
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:35,001
Let's go, dear.

355
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:30,480
