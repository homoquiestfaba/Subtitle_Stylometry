Does Okja eat and poop well?

185
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,375
[Mija]
Yes, and she has a super high metabolism.

186
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,208
[Mundo]
Right. That's what the readings say.

187
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:02,583
[Jennifer in English] Fuck me!

188
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,875
[all panting and whimpering]

189
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,042
[panting] I'm here!

190
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:18,542
All right!

191
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,500
I'm fucking here, God damn it!

192
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,333
[in Korean] He... he's that guy!
From TV, right?

193
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,417
He is.

194
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:35,375
What was it? <i>Animal Magic!</i>

195
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,125
He's the "very healthy" guy!

196
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:43,792
[in English] All the other super pigs were
on flat land, accessible by car.

197
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,208
Japan's one was five minutes
from the airport.

198
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:52,917
And you... I notice that you had to leave
the fucking mountaintop super pig

199
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,333
till the end, because you knew
that the climb would rile me.

200
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:58,792
Well, guess what? I'm riled.

201
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,417
[in Korean] Wow.
He looks exactly like he does on TV.

202
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,292
[in English] Oh, that's great.

203
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,083
[retching]

204
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,833
Can somebody...

205
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,750
Can somebody at least
bring me some water?

206
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:19,042
Seeing as I'm about to be filmed
for fucking television!

207
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,851
And not sparkling water. I don't want
to belch my way through the broadcast.

208
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:22,917
Get him some water.

209
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,375
I don't think they have
sparkling water here.

210
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,708
[in Korean] Excuse me, sir.

211
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:30,833
If you don't mind,
Dr. Johnny's a bit thirsty.

212
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:32,500
Thank you.

213
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,083
[in English] Here's your water.

214
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,333
[in Korean] Wait, that’s Soju...

215
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:41,375
Hey, that’s mine...

216
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:45,875
[bottle clatters]

217
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,583
[gasps]

218
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,208
Hey, Okja.

219
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:57,167
It's okay. Come on out.

220
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,917
That's it... Very good.

221
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,167
[Johnny gasps]

222
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,625
Well, fucking film me, Jennifer!

223
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,458
You can't fake these emotions.

224
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:27,583
[Jennifer] Oh! Uh, film him. Um...

225
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,375
Get him his uniform. Quick.

226
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,667
- Oh!
- [speaks indistinctly in Korean]

227
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,625
- [man exclaims]
- [Mija] They're filming!

228
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,684
[Jennifer in English]
Pick up his bag. Come on. Uh...

229
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,833
Oh, that's it. Is your... Mundo?

230
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:42,417
Mundo, get out of the shot, please.
Thank you very much. That's it.

231
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,250
And, uh, his hat. Get his hat.
Looking good, Dr. Johnny.

232
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,726
That's it. Everything's gonna be okay.

233
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,042
Mundo, get out of the shot.
Thank you very much.

234
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,417
And... roll.

235
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:56,417
Ten years ago, 26 local farmers
from 26 far-flung countries

236
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,250
were each given a super piglet.
This year, I traveled to each...

237
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,292
- [in Korean] What's he saying?
- Dunno.

238
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:05,750
One of those 26 farms to decide who
will be invited to The Best Super Pig Fest

239
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:11,000
in New York City,
where it will be unveiled to the world.

240
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:14,292
You've done an incredible job.

241
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,833
Thank you.

242
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:17,083
Pan to the old man!

243
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:20,708
- [Jennifer] Oh! Pan to Johnny.
- [Choi] Johnny, Johnny!

244
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:23,583
Ever since she was little,
I've always been fascinated with Okja

245
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,958
and her monthly health reports and data.

246
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:28,417
I've only known her through numbers
and graphs and pictures,

247
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,917
but seeing her here today,

248
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,375
and studying her
with my own eyes and hands,

249
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,542
she amazes me even more.

250
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,708
This is it. The moment of mutual trust

251
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:42,625
between Mirando's very own Dr. Johnny
and the esteemed local farmer.

252
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,875
- [sloshing]
- [Okja grunting]

253
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,417
She's truly exceptional.

254
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:56,000
How did you do it?
What were your methods?

255
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,458
[translating in Korean]

256
00:23:58,542 --> 00:23:59,667
[Hee Bong] Hmm.

257
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,000
[speaking Korean]

258
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,684
[Choi in English]
He just let her run around.

259
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,417
"He just let her run around."
How beguiling!

260
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,542
Show the sash to the camera, Jennifer,
and go!

261
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,542
- Ready for the festival in New York City?
- New York?

262
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,833
[snorts]

263
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:20,917
- Mm.
- [gasps]

264
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:24,958
Very healthy.

265
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:28,833
One more sash, please.

266
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,042
A special sash for a special little lady,

267
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:42,667
who I'm sure helped raise this super pig
in her own special little way.

268
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:46,417
And cut.
Get some cutaways of the pig!

269
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,042
[Choi speaking Korean]

270
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:53,500
Here. Autograph, please.

271
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,458
Oh, I guess I'm still hip in Korea.
[chuckles]

272
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,958
The kids at home don't really
appreciate me anymore.

273
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:01,208
But here... [laughing]

274
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,083
I'm sorry if I was a little grumpy
when I first came to the farm.

275
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:07,750
But, you know, being
a television presenter can be stressful.

276
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,708
I always have to be "on"...

277
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,542
now that I'm the face
of the Mirando Corporation.

278
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,333
Whoever thought that would happen?
[laughs]

279
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:25,750
[in Korean] Mija.
Let's go visit your mom and dad.

280
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,708
Now? I want to watch this.

281
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:31,583
They'll be doing this all day.

282
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:35,792
Your mom and dad appeared
in my dream last night

283
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,250
and said they missed you.

284
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,583
Come on.

285
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,625
[in English] Thank you.

286
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:49,333
[in Korean] Come quick.

287
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:51,833
It won't take long.

288
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,292
[all exclaiming]

289
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,750
[Okja squealing]

290
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:11,500
Who do you miss more?

291
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,583
Mom or dad?

292
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,583
I can't remember...

293
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,250
their faces.

294
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,583
It's been so many years.

295
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:32,792
Just the two of us in the mountains.

296
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,500
Not two. Three.

297
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:36,708
Huh?

298
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,583
Oh, sure. Three.

299
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:41,833
[laughing]

300
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:44,000
The three of us.

301
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:49,250
Okja, too.

302
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,458
[continues laughing]

303
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,833
Ta-da!

304
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:57,042
Our little fatty!

305
00:26:58,667 --> 00:26:59,667
What's that?

306
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:01,708
This is...

307
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:03,583
a gold pig.

308
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,333
100% real gold.

309
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,917
In the old days,

310
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,708
the elders would give a gold pig
to their daughters as a wedding gift.

311
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:21,833
Mija, it's yours now.

312
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:23,583
Take it.

313
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:26,958
Why all of a sudden?

314
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:34,750
[sighs]

315
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,875
Well, you're not getting married now...

316
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,417
but... Okja is going far away...

317
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:57,250
so you can keep this gold pig instead.

318
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,625
What?

319
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:05,458
The pig competition's nearly over.

320
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:10,042
So they're taking all the pigs back
to the company.

321
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,208
But Okja's ours.

322
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:14,375
We bought her from them.

323
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:17,208
You sent them the money!

324
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,625
Actually...

325
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,792
they wouldn't let me buy Okja.

326
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:27,000
So I bought you this gold pig instead.

327
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:31,292
- [shouts] What are you talking about?!
- Huh?

328
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,667
[chuckling]

329
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:36,625
Hey, did you hear that?

330
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,750
Your daughter raises her voice at me now.

331
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,250
[laughing]

332
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,750
Mija.

333
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:55,042
They say Okja was selected
as the best pig.

334
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:58,542
They have plans for her in America.

335
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,917
America?

336
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,375
She'll spend the night
at the Mirando building in Seoul.

337
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:10,917
And tomorrow,
she'll be on a plane to America.

338
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
[laughing]

339
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:17,375
She's a celebrity now!

340
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,542
[continues laughing]

341
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:22,958
Mija.

342
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:26,292
To be honest...

343
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,667
you're nearly a grown woman now.

344
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:36,542
I don't like you playing
with that pig all day.

345
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:41,500
You should go to town, meet a boy and...

346
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,125
- [clatters]
- [Hee Bong exclaims]

347
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:55,958
[panting]

348
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,750
[chickens clucking]

349
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,167
[panting]

350
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,583
Okja...

351
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,875
Hmm!

352
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:42,500
[Mija sniffles]

353
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:07,250
You must be hungry.

354
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:12,250
I made your favorite, chicken stew.
[chuckles]

355
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,458
Go wash up so we can eat.

356
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:17,250
I put in this and that.

357
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:22,417
Everything that's good for you.
[chuckles]

358
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:27,833
Where are you going?

359
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:29,792
Seoul.

360

Okja, I'll see you in New York.

709
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:12,208
[Mija] Huh?

710
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:13,417
Till we meet again.

711
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:20,708
[in Korean] Mija! Try learning English.
It opens new doors!

712
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:22,333
[Mija] Hey, wait! Mister!

713
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,542
[brakes screeching]

714
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:33,684
[officer in Korean] Hey, you!

715
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:35,125
Grab him!

716
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,125
He jumped! How did he do that?

717
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:41,625
Hey, kid. It's dangerous.

718
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:43,500
Get out of there.

719
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:48,250
- Hey, kid. Hey, come out!
- [both shouting]

720
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:06,292
- Are you kidding me?
- It's supposed to hold.

721
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:08,042
You're a fucking joke-show, mate.

722
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:11,375
- Fucking awesome, epic plan, man.
- It's a Ziploc.

723
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:13,750
- Fucking Ziploc, my ass.
- It was supposed to hold.

724
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:14,833
Seriously?

725
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:17,792
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

726
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:22,750
[Okja groans wearily]

727
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,375
[news anchor in English]
<i>Last night in South Korea,</i>

728
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:35,917
<i>Mirando employees were securing
their super pig when a young girl</i>

729
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
<i>suddenly stepped in
and tried to stop them.</i>

730
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:40,458
<i>These extraordinary events began
earlier in the day</i>

731
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:45,542
<i>with a highly-organized pignapping attempt
made by the Animal Liberation Front.</i>

732
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:49,375
I wouldn't worry too much, Luce.
The ALF technically failed.

733
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:51,138
They weren't even able
to take the product.

734
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:55,000
Yeah, it's a kerfuffle over nothing.
We shouldn't make a big deal out of it.

735
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:58,208
It actually means our security here
in the US is so airtight,

736
00:59:58,292 --> 01:00:00,250
they wouldn't even think
about breaking in.

737
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:01,976
Which is why they went all the way
to Korea.

738
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,875
<i>The ALF hasn't been in the headlines
for a number of years,</i>

739
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:08,583
<i>but they're back in the spotlight
after today's chaotic events.</i>

740
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:11,750
Well, the good news is that the pig
is on its way to New York now.

741
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:15,583
Right. And the Best Super Pig Fest
will continue as planned. [chuckles]

742
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:19,375
<i>Significant damage to Mirando's
stock price seems inevitable.</i>

743
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:22,083
<i>Yeah. Mirando is completely fucked.</i>

744
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:25,125
<i>Mirando.
That's your current employer, correct?</i>

745
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:27,583
<i>Yup. But I don't care.</i>

746
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:30,875
<i>They fucked, not me. They fucked up.</i>

747
01:00:31,542 --> 01:00:32,958
[news theme music playing]

748
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,250
[Lucy] I know what they're calling me,
those ALF fuckers.

749
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:41,750
They're calling me a psychopath.

750
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:45,667
You're not a psychopath.

751
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:48,167
They're the psychopaths.
Right, Ms. Mirando?

752
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:50,542
They're narcissists.

753
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,083
[Lucy] Do narcissists wear balaclavas?

754
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:59,000
[scoffs] Crazy radicals have been
calling us psychopaths since the '60s.

755
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:00,750
"You're a psychopath.

756
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:04,667
Your sister was a psychopath.
Your father was a psychopath."

757
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:08,750
Well, Daddy was a psychopath, Frank.
I mean, that's hardly an unfair slur.

758
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,833
"What did you do in the war, Daddy?"

759
01:01:13,417 --> 01:01:16,417
"I manufactured the napalm
that made everybody's skin fall off."

760
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,500
[chuckles]

761
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,625
And this is a man
who called his child an idiot loser.

762
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:27,417
Well, in fairness to your father,
when he called you an idiot loser,

763
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,420
you had just signed up
for a course in California

764
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:31,750
called "Unleash Your Calling."

765
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:34,875
At a highly-respected institute
for the advancement of human potential

766
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,917
where many a forward-looking CEO go.

767
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:40,083
And you know what I was doing
while I was at the institute?

768
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:45,042
I was visualizing new
and better ways of doing business.

769
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:48,125
While my sister was CEO...
What was the name of that lake?

770
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,417
Moose Lake.

771
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,333
Moose Lake. While my sister was CEO,

772
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,792
dumping so much toxic waste
into Moose Lake that it exploded...

773
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:58,708
The only lake ever to explode.
Well done, Nancy.

774
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:05,583
I was visualizing ways of turning the most
hated agrochemical company in the world

775
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:09,625
into the most likable
miracle pig-rearing company.

776
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:11,708
And it's working! It's working!

777
01:02:11,792 --> 01:02:15,125
It was working until last night.

778
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,000
Until six hours ago.

779
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:23,375
The synthesis of old Mirando
and new Mirando was impeccable.

780
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:28,000
I took nature and science,

781
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:30,667
and I synthesized.

782
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:33,083
And everyone loved it.

783
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,292
You remember what the <i>New York Times</i>
said about our super pigs?

784
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:39,208
"Intriguing," right?

785
01:02:39,292 --> 01:02:42,917
<i>Slate: </i>"Lucy Mirando is pulling off
the impossible.

786
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,500
She is making us fall in love
with a creature

787
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:47,500
that we are already looking forward
to eating."

788
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:51,250
I mean, these are journalists
who never write about pigs.

789
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:54,667
They never write about pigs!
They wrote about our pigs.

790
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:56,917
Ten years in planning!

791
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,667
On the cusp of a product launch
that will feed millions!

792
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,292
And what happens?

793
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:05,625
We get tangled up in this terrorism thing,

794
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:08,917
and somehow we end up being
the ones who look bad.

795
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,625
[chuckles] We don't look too bad.

796
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:15,125
- We don't? Open that thing!
- Yup.

797
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:19,292
No, rewind. Rewind.

798
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:22,458
Rewind!

799
01:03:23,292 --> 01:03:24,292
Okay, play.

800
01:03:25,292 --> 01:03:27,768
[male anchor] <i>The girl was later revealed</i>
<i>to be the granddaughter</i>

801
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:30,750
<i>of a local farmer selected
by Mirando CEO...</i>

802
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:32,125
[Lucy] Pause, there.

803
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:34,000
That's it.

804
01:03:34,917 --> 01:03:36,042
That's the image.

805
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,625
That is the image
that is gonna destroy us.

806
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,625
Who are those morons?

807
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:44,250
Find out and fire them.

808
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:47,125
Sure.

809
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:50,000
Abusing that adorable girl.

810
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:53,667
And in the uniforms
that I personally designed myself.

811
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:57,208
And shoving her best friend onto a truck.

812
01:03:58,083 --> 01:03:59,417
[breathes shakily]

813
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,000
That's gonna kill us.

814
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,875
Right there. That's it.

815
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:11,875
That image. We're dead.

816
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,458
[machine whirring]

817
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:49,292
[sniffing]

818
01:04:50,417 --> 01:04:53,000
Lucy, may I ask you a question?

819
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:58,000
The girl. You're thinking of bringing her
to New York, aren't you?

820
01:04:58,917 --> 01:05:00,417
I was about to say that!

821
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,500
Yes, of course.

822
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:05,042
You'll invite her
to The Best Super Pig Festival and...

823
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:07,208
A moving reunion!

824
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:11,250
The best super pig and the adorable
farmer girl forced apart

825
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:13,625
and somehow brought together on our stage.

826
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:14,958
Brilliant, Lucy.

827
01:05:15,042 --> 01:05:18,292
An emotional reunion,
and then they leave the stage together.

828
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:20,583
Hand in hand. Hand in trotter.

829
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,667
She can be the new face
of the Mirando Corporation.

830
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:26,333
She can be the embodiment
of the Mirando ideal.

831
01:05:26,417 --> 01:05:28,792
She's young, she's pretty, she's female.

832
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:32,000
She's eco-friendly and she's global!
She's a godsend!

833
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:34,333
- Are you writing this down?
- [knock on door]

834
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:35,417
Hey!

835
01:05:39,042 --> 01:05:41,542
She's not the face
of the Mirando Corporation. I am.

836
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:45,667
You don't even know
if she can do anything but cry.

837
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:48,375
Whereas I am loved...

838
01:05:50,542 --> 01:05:52,042
all over the world.

839
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,792
Could you sit down and shut
the fucking squeaking and whining?

840
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,417
You know...

841
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:10,583
you are forcing me... [chuckles]

842
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:12,583
I'm forcing you to do what?

843
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,833
To examine my options.

844
01:06:18,917 --> 01:06:21,000
[Lucy] Oh, really? Okay.

845
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:23,000
Go ahead. Examine them.

846
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:26,625
Are you examining them now?
Have you finished examining them?

847
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,667
Sit. You're a deadbeat.

848
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:32,875
Your ratings are shit. Epic fail.

849
01:06:33,875 --> 01:06:36,167
Jennifer, get her a first class ticket.

850
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,333
Get her a passport. She probably
hasn't got a passport. Get her a visa.

851
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:41,708
We'll pay for all the damage
the super pig did in Korea.

852
01:06:41,792 --> 01:06:42,958
Get an attorney on that.

853
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:46,667
Don't force an image on her,
like Benetton did with those Asian models.

854
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:49,542
Oh, no. I have a much better idea.

855
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,042
[speaking indistinctly]

856
01:06:56,542 --> 01:06:59,292
Okay, we got it all figured out.
We got a strategy. We got a plan.

857
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:01,083
We're gonna think of it like a love story.

858
01:07:01,167 --> 01:07:03,917
<i>That's what we're gonna do.
Hand those bits of paper out quickly.</i>

859
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,160
<i>We got a little girl
running around the city all alone.</i>

860
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:07,917
<i>We've got a big, big giant pig.</i>

861
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,958
<i>We gotta bring them back together
because they miss each other.</i>

862
01:07:11,042 --> 01:07:12,143
<i>Now they go to New York City.</i>

863
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:14,333
Look at her, so sweet. Cute.
Totally gorgeous.

864
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:15,917
Totally sexy. Hot, tiny, perfect.

865
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:20,958
[in Korean] At this rate,
she'll be doing Mirando commercials.

866
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:23,417
- It's very likely!
- Thank you!

867
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,958
- Mija!
- Mija.

868
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:27,208
Everything is worked out!
Don't worry about a thing.

869
01:07:27,292 --> 01:07:29,458
Let's take a photo
for our company Twitter.

870
01:07:29,542 --> 01:07:30,625
Hold this.

871
01:07:31,208 --> 01:07:32,250
[exclaims]

872
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:35,458
Get Okja on the phone now!

873
01:07:35,542 --> 01:07:36,917
I want to know how she's doing.

874
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,542
On the phone? With a pig?

875
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:41,101
[Jennifer] And we gotta tell this
to everybody in New York City!

876
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:44,208
On Instagram, on YouTube, on Tumblr,

I'll put some distance

917
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:25,833
We have to test
how far the signal reaches.

[Blond] It's all good.

- Come on.
- [Jay] Are we recording?

941
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:12,875
Yeah.

[squealing loudly]

946
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:38,917
We should never have sent her there.

947
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,667
Can you turn it off, please?

948
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,250
No.

949
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:47,125
No, we need to record this.
We need to show this.

950
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,625
At least turn the volume down.

951
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,708
- We knowingly sent her to that hellhole.
- [Blond] No, we didn't.

952
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:56,875
We didn't know
they were gonna do this to her.

953

We didn't know they were gonna
put her through this mating.

954
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:00,792
We suspected!

955
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:03,750
Come on, we all suspected.

956
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:06,667

01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,708
I know it's painful.

959
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:19,750
But we can't be weak.

960
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:20,833
That's right.

961
01:13:21,667 --> 01:13:24,500
This is why we need to stay focused.

962
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:26,417
This is why we need
to stick to the mission.

963
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:30,167
The little girl trusted us with Okja.
We have to respect her bravery.

964
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:31,958
She never agreed to send Okja.

965
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,958
[Blond] What'd you just say?

966
01:13:35,917 --> 01:13:37,083
[sighs deeply]

967
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:40,250
She was in our truck.

968
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:43,667
She said... [speaking Korean]

969
01:13:44,042 --> 01:13:46,667
[in English] "I wanna take Okja back
to the mountains."

970
01:13:48,542 --> 01:13:49,583
I lied.

971
01:13:52,917 --> 01:13:54,833
- [Red] God.
- Why did you lie?

972
01:13:56,042 --> 01:13:58,917
I don't know.
In that moment, it's just... I couldn't...

973
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:02,125
I couldn't stop the mission.

974
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:06,042
You know, this is...
this is the coolest mission ever.

975
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:08,333
- I have all this stuff and...
- Hey, K... K.

976
01:14:08,708 --> 01:14:09,708
[shushing]

977
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,875
It's okay.

978
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:14,333
[Silver yells]

979
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:17,625
I hold you dear to my heart,

980
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:20,167
but you have dishonored
the 40-year history

981
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:23,708
and meaningful legacy
of the Animal Liberation Front.

982
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:28,417
You have betrayed the great minds
and brave fighters that have preceded you.

983
01:14:29,792 --> 01:14:31,125
Never mistranslate.

984
01:14:31,542 --> 01:14:32,750

985
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:35,458
Translation is sacred.

986
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:39,750
From this moment on...

987
01:14:41,167 --> 01:14:45,042
you are no longer a member of the ALF.
You are permanently banned.

988
01:14:47,042 --> 01:14:48,042
Get out.

989
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:50,583
However...

990
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,917
since it is vital that we continue
with our mission...

991
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:58,458
we will return your equipment to you
after its completion.

992
01:14:58,542 --> 01:15:02,000
Consider this your final contribution
to the ALF.

993
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:13,583
[K] Ah, shit.

994
01:15:13,917 --> 01:15:15,500
[exhales] Oh, my God.

995
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:20,417
You want some?

01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:24,875
[groans weakly]

997
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:30,375
It'll make you feel better.

999
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:52,250
This is an unspeakable place.

I know. I know.

[continues crying]

1002
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,917
There are worse rooms out there.

I'm not supposed to harm you in here.

1004
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,125
Well, at least not visibly.

1005
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:17,292

to make his own decisions.

This is nothing, really.

It's used on beef. I mean, live cows.

Don't worry. You won't die.

We're just gonna take some of your meat.

1033

And of course, I'm not gonna eat any.

1034

01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:32,000
<i>Very healthy! Come and try!</i>

1052
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:33,309
Pink streamers, pink fireworks.

1053
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:34,976
Lucy's gonna be happy.
I'm gonna get my bonus.

1054
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,708
I'm gonna be...
What the hell is this?

1055
01:19:36,792 --> 01:19:39,625
That's Lucy's autograph.
"Designed by Lucy Mirando."

1056
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:42,125
Oh! She can't get enough of herself,
can she?

1057
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:45,333
Hey! Oh, how's everyone doing?

1058
01:19:45,417 --> 01:19:47,917
Still with this thing.
It looks super tacky.

1059
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,080
[in Korean] Don't touch it!

1060
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:50,226
[in English] Don't touch it.

1061
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,375
[in Korean]
Okay, okay. The fanny pack is fine.

1062
01:19:53,042 --> 01:19:54,976
[in English]
I think she understands some English.

1063
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,542
So we should be careful what we say.

1064
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:59,042
Yes, yes, everything is fine.

1065
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:01,000
But you have to wear this.

1066
01:20:01,083 --> 01:20:05,500
Oh, it's a special edition,
custom-made, just for you.

1067
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:08,625
Look. The CEO even autographed it.

1068
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:10,083
Boop! Totally rad, right?

1069
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:11,667
Wow. Hmm? [giggles]

1070
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:12,958
Now, let's put it on.

1071
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,375
[in Korean] Not until I see Okja.

1072
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:19,417
Mija... Oh!
Think about how dramatic it will be.

1073
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,417
Okja...
Okja doesn't even know you're here.

1074
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:26,000
If you show up on stage
without telling her,

1075
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:28,042
it'll be such a great surprise.

1076
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:30,083
You know? Surprise?

1077
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:31,625
[in Korean] I don't care about that.

1078
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:34,500
I want to see Okja first.
Or I won't cooperate.

1079
01:20:35,292 --> 01:20:37,042
- Mija...
- [translator] She said no.

1080
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:40,625
Mija. Mija, I don't think
you understand this situation.

1081
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:42,458
[translator speaking Korean]

1082
01:20:42,542 --> 01:20:45,417
No, no, no.
We are the ones who have Okja. Okay?

1083
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,792
We are doing you a favor.
Do you get it now?

1084
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:49,292
[translator speaking Korean]

1085
01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:52,375
Yep, yep, yep.
You want to go back home with Okja, right?

1086
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:54,625
Then do as you're told.

1087
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:58,375
Otherwise,
this is what will happen to Okja.

1088
01:20:58,458 --> 01:21:00,792
[translator speaking Korean]

1089
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:01,875
Put it on.

1090
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:05,500
The turnout's looking good,
don't you think?

1091
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:08,303
- [woman] Lucy must be thrilled.
- [Jennifer] Yeah. Tell me about it.

1092
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:09,583
All eyes on her.

1093
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:11,307
[woman]
Thinks it's her own fashion show.

1094
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:19,375
[Jay] Mija.

1095
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,417
[shushing] It's me.

1096
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:24,708
Jay.

1097
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,542
[Jennifer laughing] Oh, shut up!

1098
01:21:42,292 --> 01:21:43,542
[sniffles]

1099
01:22:17,375 --> 01:22:19,417
[people cheering in distance]

1100
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,667
- [festive music playing]
- [people cheering]

1101
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,708
[announcer speaking indistinctly]

1102
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:01,833
[all cheering]

1103
01:23:39,542 --> 01:23:42,042
Oh, man, this is so good, man.
You gotta try this.

1104
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:43,458
It's actually really good.

1105
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:48,542
- [knock on door]
- [door opens]

1106
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:51,625
Good day, all. Thank you very much.

1107
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:54,875
These are for you.

1108
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:56,583
Oh! Thanks, Frank.

1109
01:23:58,292 --> 01:24:01,000
Ten years.
An extraordinary accomplishment.

1110
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:04,833
Ten years, finally coming to fruition.
[chuckles]

1111
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:08,792
You have to try one of these.
They're completely delicious.

1112
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Delicious.

1113
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:21,667
Beautiful.

1114
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:23,583
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

1115
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:24,917
Mmm.

1116
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,250
Mmm.

1117
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:37,625
Such a shame we had to tell
all those little white lies.

1118
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:45,375
It's not our fault that the consumers
are so paranoid about GM foods.

1119
01:24:52,167 --> 01:24:53,917
These are really beautiful.

1120
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,542
[sniffing] Oh!

1121
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:58,417
Your taste is as impeccable as always.

1122
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,625
- Oh.
- [Lucy chuckles]

1123
01:25:00,292 --> 01:25:02,500
Well, the flowers aren't actually from me.

1124
01:25:02,583 --> 01:25:03,583
Oh?

1125
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,375
- Are they from Nancy?
- Yes.

1126
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,708
Nancy's here. Not in London.

1127
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:12,333
She's here? In New York?

1128
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:14,708
Fuck Nancy.

1129
01:25:15,417 --> 01:25:17,875
- She's been here a while.
- I told you to keep her away!

1130
01:25:17,958 --> 01:25:19,583
She frightens people!

1131
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:21,708
You frighten people, too, Lucy.

1132
01:25:24,042 --> 01:25:27,375
Yeah, but she really frightens people.
She reminds them of Daddy.

1133
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:38,833
This is mine. This is my project.

1134
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,000
She just wants to support you
on your special day.

1135
01:25:43,625 --> 01:25:44,792
Is she watching me?

1136
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:47,667
[all cheering]

1137
01:25:49,417 --> 01:25:50,708
[Johnny cackling]

1138
01:25:50,792 --> 01:25:52,958
Johnny's in the house!
Johnny's in the house!

1139
01:25:53,542 --> 01:25:55,333
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

1140
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,667
- Yes!
- [woman] We love you, Johnny!

1141
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:03,375
Yeah!

1142
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:05,875
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

1143
01:26:06,667 --> 01:26:08,250
[man] Johnny!

1144
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:14,667
Dr. Johnny's...

1145
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:17,000
[all] Magical Animals!

1146
01:26:17,083 --> 01:26:18,333
[laughing]

1147
01:26:18,417 --> 01:26:22,542
Everybody knows
Dr. Johnny can't stand anything boring!

1148
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:24,292
[all] No!

1149
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:28,375
- Have I ever given you a boring show?
- [all] No!

1150
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:32,167
- [Red grunts]
- [Johnny] Who's ready?

1151
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,625
[crowd cheering]

1152
01:26:40,292 --> 01:26:45,750
Ten years ago,
26 farmers from lands far away

1153
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:49,042
were each given a magical super piglet.

1154
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:53,458
This year, I met these wonderful people,

1155
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:57,083
to decide which super piglet
would have the honor of being invited

1156
01:26:57,167 --> 01:26:59,167
to this prestigious occasion.

1157
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,250
Are you ready to meet
the winner of this contest?

1158
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:06,375
[all] Yeah!

1159
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:10,000
The best super pig
on the face of the Earth?

1160
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:11,667
[all] Yeah!

1161
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:17,250
- Are you ready?
- [loud cheering]

1162
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:20,000
Well, I'm afraid you're gonna
have to meet somebody else first.

1163
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:21,875
[chuckling]
Isn't that the way it always is?

1164
01:27:21,958 --> 01:27:23,809
Before you meet the talent,
you gotta meet the suits.

1165
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:24,913
- [cackles]
- [crowd laughs]

1166
01:27:24,958 --> 01:27:26,833
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

1167
01:27:28,958 --> 01:27:31,417
She is an amazing little lady...

1168
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:37,375
and she happens to be the brain
behind this entire super pig project!

1169
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:42,458
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

1170
01:27:42,542 --> 01:27:45,208
for the one, the only,

1171
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:48,250
Lucy Mirando!

1172
01:27:48,333 --> 01:27:50,375
- [crowd cheering]
- [upbeat music plays]

1173
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:02,792
[chuckling] "Lucy Mirando!"

1174
01:28:04,792 --> 01:28:05,792
Fucking idiot.

1175
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:08,208
You look amazing!

1176
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:12,958
Oh, Johnny.

1177
01:28:13,042 --> 01:28:17,083
You're skating on thin ice.
Watch out you don't fall in and drown.

1178
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,375
Don't worry.
I'm not here to put you to sleep

1179
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:22,500
with some corporate speech
like my boring sister might have.

1180
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:23,625
[crowd laughing]

1181
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:25,000
[man 1] Yeah, there it is!

1182
01:28:25,083 --> 01:28:26,833
[man 2] Go on, Lucy!

1183
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,167
[woman] Lucy, we love you!

1184
01:28:30,417 --> 01:28:35,583
No. I'm here to introduce you
to a real superstar.

1185
01:28:36,292 --> 01:28:40,667
Maybe you've already seen her on YouTube,
enjoying her little shopping spree

1186
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:43,583
in that underground mall in Seoul!

1187
01:28:43,667 --> 01:28:47,708
So let's all welcome
an extraordinary little girl.

1188
01:28:47,792 --> 01:28:51,542
A local farmer
who raised her beloved super pig

1189
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:54,625
in wild and beautiful nature.

1190
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:59,208
The fearless pig rider
from across the globe!

1191
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:00,500
Please welcome...

1192
01:29:01,458 --> 01:29:02,458
Mija!

1193
01:29:02,542 --> 01:29:03,875
[crowd cheering loudly]

1194
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:17,333
And here she is! Our ultimate super pig!

1195
01:29:17,417 --> 01:29:18,875
Okja!

1196
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:21,250
- [crowd cheering loudly]
- [fanfare music playing]

1197
01:30:15,292 --> 01:30:16,625
[Okja groans softly]

1198
01:30:17,917 --> 01:30:19,250
[crowd gasping]

1199
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:21,958
[squeals loudly]

1200
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,792
[Mija] Okja! Okja!

1201
01:30:25,083 --> 01:30:26,375
[people gasping]

1202
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:29,792
[man] Hey, get her off the stage!

1203
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
[Mija] Okja!

1204
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:37,333
[squeals]

1205
01:30:38,417 --> 01:30:40,083
Come on. Now!

1206
01:30:40,167 --> 01:30:42,292
Good. Here's Johnny!

1207
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:45,042
- [alarm blaring]
- [people screaming]

1208
01:30:45,125 --> 01:30:46,125
[squealing weakly]

1209
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:47,375
[gasps]

1210
01:30:48,167 --> 01:30:49,625
[Jay] Mija!

1211
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:52,875
Don't look back.

1212
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:54,292
[people screaming]

1213
01:30:57,458 --> 01:30:58,667
Just look at me.

1214
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:03,083
- Turn it off! Turn it... Kill the screen!
- [crowd gasping]

1215
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:05,833
[stammering] <i>I'm an animal lover.</i>

1216
01:31:07,833 --> 01:31:08,833
Stop it!

1217
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:14,458
Go!

1218
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:17,167
[explodes]

1219
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:21,625
[crowd chanting] Save that pig!
Save that pig! Save that pig!

1220
01:31:21,708 --> 01:31:24,417
[Lucy] No! No, no, no! No! No!

1221
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:31,750
I promise... No, I pledge,
to learn everything I can,

1222
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:33,875
everything from this situation...

For more details and shocking proof

1225
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:43,500
of Mirando's crimes
against humanity and animals,

1226
01:31:43,583 --> 01:31:47,000
go to YouTube and search
"Mirando is fucked."

1227
01:31:47,083 --> 01:31:49,667
That's right, folks. Go to YouTube now

1228
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:55,250
and search "Mirando is F-U-C-K-E-D."

1229
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:56,958
Fucked!

1230

[crowd shouting in distance]

1231
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,667
I don't think we have a choice, Nancy.

1232
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:13,208
You have to go out there.

1233
01:32:14,833 --> 01:32:16,083
[Nancy] You don't say.

1234
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:21,083
What a clusterfuck.

1235
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:24,375
Let's get private security in there.

1236
01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:26,792
Black Chalk.

1237
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:29,125
We're on good terms
with the NYPD, correct?

1238
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:30,500
[Frank] <i>Hundred percent.</i>

1239
01:32:30,583 --> 01:32:32,000
<i>We have an arrangement.</i>

1243
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:39,500
[Jay] Okja! No!

[crowd gasps]

1245

[siren wailing]

1246
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:54,625

- Blond! Let's move!
- [Blond] Go, go, go!

1254

Come here, come here.

1255
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:01,458
Red, let's go.

1256
01:34:01,542 --> 01:34:02,542
Move!

1257
01:34:05,042 --> 01:34:06,976

- [Blond] Up to the right!

1258
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,542
[Jay] More Black Chalk! Hurry!

[beeping]

1268
01:35:59,083 --> 01:36:03,625
Well, good luck
with clearing up my mess, twinny.

1269
01:36:06,292 --> 01:36:09,833
Well, for a while back then,
you forgot you were such a loser.

1270
01:36:24,042 --> 01:36:26,958
I mean, Daddy was a terrible man.

1271
01:36:28,292 --> 01:36:29,625
He was a real horror.

1272
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:35,042
But, by God, did he know about business.

1273
01:36:37,833 --> 01:36:39,042
[sighs]

1274
01:36:41,333 --> 01:36:43,917
Don't worry about your apology speech,
twinny.

1275
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,250
I'll pretend to be you
in front of the press.

1276
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:48,792
- [siren chirps]
- Ah! The police.

1277
01:36:49,458 --> 01:36:52,138
You'll understand that I will be
instructing our corporate attorneys

1278
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:54,333
not to assist you in any way.

1279
01:36:54,417 --> 01:36:55,417
Frank.

1280
01:36:58,292 --> 01:37:01,875
- Zero delay on the distribution plan.
- Of course.

1281
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:05,000
Scrap Lucy's precious
promotional marketing crap.

1282
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:08,875
- Tell everyone ASAP.
- Definitely.

1283
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:11,417
We already have FDA approval, correct?

1284
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:15,333
Yes, we do. But I'm not sure
how the customers will react after today.

1285
01:37:15,417 --> 01:37:17,042
If it's cheap, they'll eat it.

1286
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:19,792
I guarantee early sales will be strong.

1287
01:37:20,375 --> 01:37:22,792
Shut down the lab as already discussed.

1288
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:25,417
We'll visit the production facility
later tonight.

1289
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,583
Get all the execs there,
even the ones on vacation.

1290
01:37:27,667 --> 01:37:29,125
Put all the pigs into production.

1291
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:31,333
[Frank] Even the best super pig?

1292
01:37:31,417 --> 01:37:33,458
[Nancy] Every last one of them.

1293
01:37:44,167 --> 01:37:47,125
- You okay?
- K... [laughs weakly]

1294
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:48,458
What are you doing?

1295
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:56,375
Okja...

1296
01:37:57,458 --> 01:37:58,667
We need to hurry.

1297
01:37:59,625 --> 01:38:00,833
[groaning]

1298
01:38:04,417 --> 01:38:06,417
Look, I'm just saying that
if I call you one time,

1299
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,768
I like for you to pick up the first time,
know what I mean?

1300
01:38:08,792 --> 01:38:11,958
Like, I have a friend here
who's incredibly sick.

1301
01:38:13,917 --> 01:38:16,375
Are you even certified?
Do you know what you're doing?

1302
01:38:17,542 --> 01:38:19,917
The guy's bleeding out!
Do you know what you're doing?

1303
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,667
[woman speaks angrily in Korean]

1304
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:40,917
Mija, are you okay?

1305
01:38:44,583 --> 01:38:46,500
[speaking Korean]

1306
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:50,250
She wants to know where we're going.

1307
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:55,958
We're going to Okja.

1308
01:38:56,667 --> 01:38:57,667
[Mija] Okja?

1309
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:03,708
Yes, but you should know
the situation is not good.

1310
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:06,458
[in Korean] What is it?

1311
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:09,833
I didn't... There is no other way.

1312
01:39:14,167 --> 01:39:16,333
[sighs]
I wish you didn't have to see this.

1313
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:18,375
Just tell me where she is!

1314
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,958
We are going to need your help. Mija...

1315
01:39:32,375 --> 01:39:33,625
- [electricity sizzles]
- Ah!

1316
01:39:38,292 --> 01:39:40,167
[super pigs squealing]

1317
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:48,542
[softly] Okja.

1318
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:49,792
Wait! Mija!

1319
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:52,708
[electricity crackling]

1320
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:56,417
Okja!

- [Jay] Okja!

1327
01:40:10,292 --> 01:40:11,500
- [K] Okja!
- [Mija] Okja!

1328
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:14,792
Emergency, emergency.
We have intruders in section A-24!

1329
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:15,875
[K] Come on.

1330
01:40:16,625 --> 01:40:17,667
- I'm so sorry.
- [choking]

1331
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:21,250
[K] This is nonlethal.
This is a nonlethal choke hold, okay?

1332
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:24,750
All right, you're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine. Okay?

1333
01:40:25,292 --> 01:40:28,833
Six minutes, 45 seconds
before Black Chalk arrive!

1334
01:40:30,208 --> 01:40:31,833
This is our last chance.

1335
01:40:32,375 --> 01:40:33,375
[squealing loudly]

1336
01:40:41,042 --> 01:40:43,458

Okja!

[Okja squeals]

1356
01:43:23,792 --> 01:43:26,059
- [Nancy] This what caused the alarm?
- [Frank] I believe so.

1357
01:43:26,083 --> 01:43:29,208
I'm flummoxed that security is so lax
as to allow a bunch of hooligans

1358
01:43:29,292 --> 01:43:31,208
to delay the production line,
even for a second.

1359
01:43:31,292 --> 01:43:34,750
It won't happen again. Please note
that Black Chalk was here exactly on time.

1360
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:37,833
- [K] No, guys, guys, this is...
- [Jay] Please, don't touch her!

1361
01:43:37,917 --> 01:43:40,667
- Sir! Sir, put the gun down. It's okay.
- [K] Stop! Less violence!

1362
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:41,917
No! No violence!

1363
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,500
Isn't this Lucy's beloved
fearless pig rider?

1364
01:43:45,583 --> 01:43:49,875
She is. And that's our best super pig.

1365
01:43:49,958 --> 01:43:51,292
Well, what's the hiccup?

1366
01:43:52,208 --> 01:43:53,708
Why is it still alive?

1367
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:56,042
[in English] Why you want to kill Okja?

1368
01:43:56,792 --> 01:43:58,958
Well, we can only sell the dead ones.

1369
01:44:00,625 --> 01:44:03,917
I wanna go home with Okja.

1370
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,583
No, it's my property.

1371
01:44:06,667 --> 01:44:10,042
- You're a fucking psychopath.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

1372
01:44:10,125 --> 01:44:13,208
Fuck off! We're extremely proud
of our achievements.

1373
01:44:13,292 --> 01:44:15,167
We're very hardworking businesspeople.

1374
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:18,208
We do deals,
and these are the deals we do.

1375
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:22,083
This is the tenderloin
for the sophisticated restaurants.

1376
01:44:22,167 --> 01:44:25,375
The Mexicans love the feet.
I know. Go figure!

1377
01:44:25,458 --> 01:44:30,792
We all love the face and the anus,
as American as apple pie! Hot dogs.

1378
01:44:30,875 --> 01:44:34,458
It's all edible.
All edible, except the squeal.

[squeals loudly]

1380
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:39,958
- So you're the other Mirando.
- And you are?

1381
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:43,583
- Let Mija and Okja go.
- [Nancy] Why?

1382
01:44:44,792 --> 01:44:46,625
You already have a shitload of money.

1383
01:44:47,208 --> 01:44:49,625
- Please.
- This is business.

1384
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:53,625
Hey, Nancy!
I hold all creatures dear to my heart,

1385
01:44:53,708 --> 01:44:56,250
but you are crying out to be an exception.

1386
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:58,083
Mija!

[Mija in Korean] No, wait!

1391
01:45:18,583 --> 01:45:21,708
[in English] I want to buy Okja... alive.
