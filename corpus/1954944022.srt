00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:30,231
Fight!

3
00:00:41,924 --> 00:00:45,424
Uh, I’mma tell you that you not my competition
I’mma always win, throw me in and I’m going in

4
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:47,524
I ain’t running, I’mma come until you leave
I'm 'bout to get it,talk about it

5
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:49,324
‘cause I really live it
On them nights on a mission,

6
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:51,624
no fear, no hope in my vision
Don’t need no intervention,

7
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:54,224
you ain’t down to rider
And even if you was I come out, point ‘em out,

8
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:58,584
they all gon’ be missing
Wonder why I’m still here act a fool if you met me

9
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:00,584
You try to be brave
and step up with you crew it’s too scary

10
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:02,771
Plus I’m too legendary,
It’s what we go hard for

11
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:04,876
I’m rocking your block,
you on top you get knocked off

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,900
I’m taking your place yeah,
I'll make it my property

13
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:09,129
May be a game to you, probably,
that’s a way of life for me

14
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:12,489
And so it’s only right for me,
annihilate ‘em if they in my way or sight

15
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:15,889
Keep 'em up off of me,
a weakness in you only make an appetite

16
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:17,989
Anytime I get into it I be looking at them,
looking pitiful

17
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:20,389
And their condition it be critical,
nothing less than original

18
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:21,689
Cross me once that's the end of you

19
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:22,589
WHO'S NEXT?

20
00:01:22,589 --> 00:01:26,189

21
00:01:27,089 --> 00:01:27,889
