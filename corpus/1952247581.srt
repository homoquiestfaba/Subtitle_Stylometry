1
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:29,226
- One minute, people.

2
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:31,429
- I still have to do touch-ups
on Sylvia.

3
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,499
- What are you telling me for?

4
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,100
Where the hell is Sylvia?

5
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:52,316
- Hi, Iowa.
How now, brown cow.

6
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:53,551
- Hey, Dale?

7
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:54,952
- Yeah, yeah.
How's it going, Josh?

8
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:56,119
- It's okay.
It's okay.

9
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,388
Look, Dale,
Sylvia seems to be M.I.A.

10
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:00,424
- Well,
that's not very professional.

11
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:01,492
- No, no, it's not.

12
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:03,360
- Damn unprofessional,
if you ask me.

13
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:04,428
- And I agree.

14
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:05,563
Any idea where she may be?

15
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:07,865
- Now, how would I know that,
Josh, hmm?

16
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:12,269
I'm not my weather girl's
keeper, right?

17
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,705
Right?

18
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:32,490
- Yeah, it's just that
we're on in about 25 seconds,

19
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:33,757
And I know
you and she are close.

20
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:35,926
So if you have any idea
where she may be...

21
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:41,431
- Josh, my personal life
is my business.

22
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:44,167
Are we clear on that?

23
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:47,237
Are we?

24
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:49,607
- Sure.

25
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:50,641
Mary!

26
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:52,877
- I'm going now.

27
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:58,716
Ms. Miller?

28
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:01,752
Um, Ms. Miller,
everybody's waiting,

29
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:05,322
And we're on in 20 seconds.

30
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:06,790
She's not answering.

31
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,926
I don't really--

32
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:11,128
I got her.

33
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,176
- Jesus Christ, Sylvia.

34
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:29,146
- Not cool, Syl.

35
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:31,081
Not cool.

36
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:33,817
- All right, we got her.

37
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,553
- All right, ten seconds.

38
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:36,921
- Rolling at her.

39
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,423
- This is Seattle Morning

40
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:43,493
With Dale Waters,
Sherry Warren,

41
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:47,831
And sassy weather girl
Sylvia Miller.

42
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:48,832
- Count it off.

43
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,601
- Five, four...

44
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:53,637
- three, two...

45
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,140
- Oh, what a great morning.

46
00:02:57,141 --> 00:02:59,443
- Oh, not too shabby,
Dale.

47
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:00,611
- Good morning, Seattle.

48
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:01,979
And good morning to you,
Sherry.

49
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,180
- Good morning to you, Dale.

50
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:04,848
- You look great this morning,
Sherry.

51
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:05,849
- Oh, stop it.

52
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,084
You're making me blush.

53
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:08,318
- No, seriously.
- Oh.

54
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,453
- You look great, seriously.

55
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:10,454
Doesn't she look great?

56
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:11,755
- Come on, you.

57
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:13,557
- Let's say hello
to our sassy weather girl.

58
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:15,292
- Mmm.

59
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:16,293
- Good morning, Sylvia.

60
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:17,394
- Good morning, Sylvia.

61
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:25,202
- Did we lose Sylvia?
- What?

62
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:27,304
What's going on?
- She's not talking.

63
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:29,974
- The rain is sure
coming down out there, Sylvia.

64
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:32,209
How long is it gonna
go on like this?

65
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,011
- Forever, Dale.

66
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:35,012
This is Seattle.

67
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:36,113
In case you haven't noticed,

68
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:39,049
The weather here sucks.

69
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:45,889
- Well, I think
it's romantic, Dale.

70
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,057
- Go to camera three, please.

71
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:48,892
- ...A stroll in
the rain with your sweetheart.

72
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:50,094
- Oh, God, shut up.

73
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:53,631
Shut up, shut up,
you squeaky little bitch.

74
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:55,298
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

75
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:56,433
We don't call her

76
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:58,602
"Our sassy weather girl"
for nothing, folks.

77
00:03:58,603 --> 00:03:59,903
Let's go to a commercial.
- Okay.

78
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:00,904
- You know what, Dale?

79
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:02,106
Before we do that,

80
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:03,874
There is something
that I would like to share

81
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,408
With our viewing audience.

82
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:07,477
- Well, I don't think that's
such a great idea, Sylvia.

83
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:09,847
- I don't care what you think,
you arrogant prick.

84
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:11,448
In fact, why don't you just
sit there

85
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:12,616
And look stupid.

86
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:17,254
- Whatever you do,
do not cut.

87
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:19,289
Do not cut.

88
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,759
- So this is a little segment
that I like to call

89
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,094
"Behind the scenes
of Seattle Morning."

90
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:25,095
- Oh, my God.

91
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:26,363
- Many of you may not know,

92
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:28,331
But from the moment
that I started working here,

93
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:31,835
Our seemingly charming cohost
Dale Waters

94
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:36,140
Has been all over me
like a cheap suit.

95
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:37,507
Day after day,

96
00:04:37,508 --> 00:04:40,410
As I stood in front
of this stupid map

97
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:42,245
Repeatedly trying
to find new adjectives

98
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:44,347
To describe the word "Rain"...

99
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:45,448
- what do I do?

100
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:46,984
- I've been fighting off
the infantile

101
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:50,520
And often offensive advances
of that guy.

102
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:52,189
That's right, ladies.
He's grabby.

103
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,290
- Go to Dale.

104
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,325
- But you know,
for a plethora of reasons,

105
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:58,295
Not the least of which being
I am 35, single,

106
00:04:58,296 --> 00:05:01,131
And, um, yeah,
occasionally lonely,

107
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:03,266
I gave in to his advances.

108
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:06,269
And we had several, you know,

109
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,709
What could only be described
as disappointing encounters.

110
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,610
Sorry.

111
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,946
But despite the amateurish sex,

112
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:18,248
I somehow developed
an attachment

113
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:20,383
To the walking haircut
sitting in that chair.

114
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:21,785
We moved in together

115
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:28,025
And began to share a boring,
stagnant, passionless life.

116
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,693
- What the hell is she doing?

117
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:31,195
George, help me.

118
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:32,529
Cut the lighting!
- No, no, no, no.

119
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,031
Do not cut anything.
This is good tv.

120
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:35,565
- She has lost her mind.

121
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:37,868
- That is, until this morning,

122
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:40,437
When after Dale had already
left for the studio,

123
00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:43,306
I found these.

124
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:47,544
They're not mine.

125
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:48,578
- You go, Sylvia.

126
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:49,747
There's our Emmy.
This is it.

127
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:51,048
- Now, these are
a pair of panties

128
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:52,449
That I've unfortunately
witnessed

129
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,519
My exhibitionist cohost wearing
on several occasions.

130
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,455
How long have you been
sleeping with him, Sherry?

131
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:00,690
- All right, number four
to Sherry, please.

132
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:05,963
- Ah, well put, Sherry.

133
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:08,799
Well, I am now leaving
this stupid, meaningless job,

134
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,067
But before I go,

135
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:13,370
I just want to say
to all of you out there,

136
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:16,373
For the love of God,
read a newspaper.

137
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:17,574
This is not news.

138
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:18,575
This is fluff.

139
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:21,478
This is tidbits for dumb people.

140
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,749
On that note,
I will say good-bye

141
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,184
To Seattle Morning,

142
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:30,053
And I will see you all in hell.

143
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,023
- What has she done?

144
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:40,463
- Wow.
Let's do a commercial.

145
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:41,598
- Go to commercial.

146
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:43,000
- Go to commercial.

147
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:47,304
That was great.

148
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:51,141
That was great.

149
00:06:57,748 --> 00:06:59,449
- Hmm.

150
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,351
- Hey.

151
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:03,687
- I know you, right?

152
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:05,522
Wait, I know.

153
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:06,790
Aren't you that weather girl

154
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,859
Who committed career suicide
in a very unsightly way

155
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,694
Before an audience of thousands
this morning?

156
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:12,129
- Oh, God.

157
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,430
- Oh, shit.
Okay, come on.

158
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:14,798
Come on in.
It's okay.

159
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,166
Come on.
- Oh, oh, God.

160
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:18,335
What did you do in here?
It's--

161
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:19,402
- You want me to kick his ass?

162
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:20,737
- Yes.
- Really?

163
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:23,273
- No, it's--
Please, no, don't kick his ass.

164
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:25,242
- All right,
I don't think I could anyway.

165
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:26,343
You want a drink?

166
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:28,846
- It's 9:00 in the morning.

167
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:29,847
Yes.

168
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:32,115
Oh.

169
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:33,717
God, oh, wait,
can I have a bloody mary?

170
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:37,387
- Yeah, let me whip that up
for you.

171
00:07:37,388 --> 00:07:41,458
I'm going to enjoy
an apple martini.

172
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,060
You look like shit.

173
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:46,563
Oh, that's good.

174
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:47,564
- Thank you.

175
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:48,565
- No, I'm serious.

176
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:49,699
You--You look like shit.

177
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,301
This is, like,
you look really, really--

178
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:53,203
This is, like, the worst
I've ever seen you look.

179
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:54,804
- Okay, is this supposed
to be helping me?

180
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:56,974
- Syl, I'm your brother,
and I'm really very fond of you,

181
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,008
But I cannot be okay

182
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,343
With you being
this much of a wreck

183
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:01,311
Over that douche bag
from the morning show.

184
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:02,980
- Hey, can I have, like,
five minutes here?

185
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:03,981
I'm kind of upset.

186
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:04,982
- I'm trying to help.

187
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:06,383
- Well, you can help
by shutting up.

188
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:07,885
What's happening here?

189
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:09,186
- Okay, you know what?

190
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:11,088
If you want to get all upset
over some stupid dude

191
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:13,056
Who I never liked,
then go nuts.

192
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:14,992
- I am well aware
of your opinion, thank you.

193
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:16,659
- Oh, well, then I guess
I don't have to say,

194
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,694
"I told you so"

195
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:19,429
Because I already did,
like, 50 times.

196
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,630
I mean, this guy's an idiot,

197
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:22,299
And my big sister's a wreck
because of him.

198
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
It's embarrassing.

199
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:24,401
- God, you are such an idiot.

200
00:08:24,402 --> 00:08:26,036
Okay, it's not just him.

201
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,871
It's everything.

202
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:29,206
Two years, we were together.

203
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:30,507
Okay, two years.

204
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:32,042
We--We lived together.

205
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:33,710
We bought furniture together.

206
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,812
We talked about kids' names.

207
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:36,846
And where am I now?

208
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:37,847
I--

209
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:38,982
I'm 35 years old.

210
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:41,285
I have no job,
no insurance,

211
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:42,352
No apartment,

212
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:43,954
$1,500 in a savings account,

213
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:46,656
A car that I couldn't afford
payments on when I was employed,

214
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:47,857
And, um, what else don't I have?

215
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:49,259
Oh, you know what else
I don't have?

216
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,094
I don't have a boyfriend.

217
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:52,562
- Tell me about
this savings account.

218
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:54,197
- I don't know what I'm doing.

219
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:55,399
What I'm going to do?

220
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,968
It's like I'm starting
all over again.

221
00:08:57,969 --> 00:08:59,169
Oh, my God.

222
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,438
I have to start all over again.

223
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,640
Oh, God,
I'm such an idiot.

224
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:04,741
Why didn't I stick around?

225
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:07,811
I could have hung around
and gotten a job

226
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:09,779
Or looked for an apartment
or something.

227
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,081
- Yeah, that's a great idea.

228
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:12,849
Just hang out and pretend
that you don't know

229
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,684
Dale's doing his cohost,
a much better option.

230
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:15,986
- I'm just trying
to be rational.

231
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:18,422
- God, you're so full of shit.

232
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:20,723
Let me just share with you
one of your qualities.

233
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:21,724
All right?

234
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:22,892
You couldn't be rational

235
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:24,928
At the cost of your pride
for anything.

236
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:26,396
You did just
what you should have done

237
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:28,698
And also conveniently
what you had to do

238
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:30,567
Because of your love
of conflict.

239
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:32,469
- I don't love conflict.

240
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,071
- It's your crack.

241
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:35,072
Now, shut up.

242
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:36,073
You're going to stay here.

243
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:37,207
You're going to get a job,

244
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,042
And everything's
going to be okay, okay?

245
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:40,210
- You think so?

246
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:41,445
- Yeah, why not?

247
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,980
- Okay.

248
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,581
- Well, I think we should
cut his balls off.

249
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:45,815
- Can you say that
any louder?

250
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:46,816
- Oh, I'm sorry.

251
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:48,051
Am I embarrassing you?

252
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:49,719
I was trying to be supportive
of my friend.

253
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
- Are you saying I'm not?

254
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:51,721
- I'm saying that maybe

255
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:53,190
Making passive-aggressive
comments

256
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:55,058
And trying to undermine me
like you always do

257
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,759
Is not the best way
to help Sylvia.

258
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
- I undermine you?

259
00:09:57,761 --> 00:09:58,928
When have I ever undermine--

260
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:00,330
- I don't know why I'm here.

261
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,764
I don't feel
like being out tonight.

262
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:02,765
Why did I go out tonight?

263
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:03,933
I should be at home.

264
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,535
I should be at home,
sitting on the couch,

265
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:08,238
Eating ice cream, and watching
old movies or something.

266
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:10,240
- What you need is a cocktail
and your girlfriends.

267
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:11,241
- Yes.

268
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,275
- Hey, weather girl.
- Hi.

269
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:14,511
- Dale is such an asshole.

270
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:16,446
You go, girl.

271
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,050
- Who says, "You go, girl"?

272
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:23,019
- Okay, yeah, no,
I need another drink.

273
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,354
- Honey, let me tell you
something.

274
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:25,755
I am so proud
of what you did today.

275
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:26,856
- Yeah, me too.

276
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:28,425
- You did exactly
what I would have done.

277
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:29,459
- Me too.

278
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,893
- Gave it to him
in front of everyone.

279
00:10:30,894 --> 00:10:32,295
- And the bitch.
- The mousy bitch.

280
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:34,731
- There is no way that frail
little bitch is good in bed.

281
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:36,600
No way.

282
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:37,601
- Well, thanks, you guys.

283
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:38,602
You know, I didn't plan it.

284
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:41,638
It just sort of--
Blah, happened.

285
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,573
- So what are you
going to do now, love?

286
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:45,475
- Uh, send out my resume,
I guess.

287
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:48,911
- Oh, a weather girl resume?

288
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:50,313
What?
She's a weather girl.

289
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:52,148
- I'm a broadcast journalist,
Jane.

290
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,217
- Jesus, Jane,
she's a broadcast journalist.

291
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:55,485
What is wrong with you?

292
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:56,753
- I made a mistake.

293
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:58,655
- Look, there are four other
local news stations

294
00:10:58,656 --> 00:10:59,689
With morning, afternoon,

295
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,124
And nighttime news programs,
right?

296
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,293
So there's got to be something
out there, I think.

297
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:04,861
- Mm.
- Mm-Hmm.

298
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:05,862
- Oh, incoming.

299
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:07,163
- Hi.
- Hi.

300
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:08,732
- Excuse me for interrupting.

301
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:12,068
My friends and I over there,
we had a bet.

302
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:13,270
Are you that chick

303
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:16,640
That totally lost her shit
on that news guy?

304
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,802
Jesus christ.

305
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:48,070
- No, Byron, actually.

306
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:50,139
- Who are you?

307
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,941
- I'm Byron.

308
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:54,577
- And why are you here?

309
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:57,980
- I'm a friend of Walt's.

310
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:59,716
- What?

311
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:03,019
Wha-Wha-What is that?

312
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,355
- Oh, that's you, actually.

313
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:06,623
- What am I...

314
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:08,257
what am I doing
on the computer?

315
00:12:08,258 --> 00:12:10,627
- Uh, you're freaking out.

316
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:12,796
Here, it's actually
my favorite part.

317
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:14,664
- But despite
the amateurish sex,

318
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:16,299
I somehow developed
an attachment

319
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,101
To the walking haircut
sitting in that chair.

320
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:21,771
I'm sorry.

321
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:24,507
I love it when you call him
a haircut.

322
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:26,275
I don't know why.

323
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:28,411
- Why--Why am I on there?

324
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:30,112
- You're everywhere.

325
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:31,348
You're on a bunch
of film sites.

326
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:32,449
I mean, just alone today

327
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,883
I've gotten ten emails
from people,

328
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:36,018
And only one of them
was from Walt.

329
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:38,087
- Wait, Walt sent this to you?

330
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:41,958
- Yeah, Walt and others.

331
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:45,328
Hey, Walt.

332
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:46,963
- Hey.

333
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:48,130
- Hey, Walt.

334
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:50,633
- Hey.

335
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:52,134
What?

336
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:54,371
I didn't do anything.

337
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:58,207
Hey!
Ow!

338
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,208
What--

339
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:00,377
- Get in there.

340
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:02,345
- What are you--Why are you
tugging on me?

341
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:04,981
- I am on the internet.

342
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:05,982
- Well, yeah.

343
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:07,216
It was a pretty funny breakdown.

344
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:08,618
People like seeing others
lose it.

345
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:10,820
- I did not lose it.

346
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:13,590
- Okay.

347
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:15,091
- And who is this person?

348
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:16,092
- Byron.

349
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:17,394
- Byron, okay, well,

350
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:19,328
I don't think that Byron
should be here right now.

351
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:20,530
I'm kind of in a delicate state.

352
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:23,500
Oh, my God.
- Yo.

353
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,002
Hey, uh,
you brought the beer in here?

354
00:13:26,003 --> 00:13:27,069
- Oh, shit, sorry.

355
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,204
Look, I don't get it.

356
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:29,773
You just went out
with all your friends.

357
00:13:29,774 --> 00:13:31,608
Now you're all too distraught
for visitors?

358
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:32,876
- Excuse me.

359
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:35,645
Hi, we are kind of
in the middle of something here.

360
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:36,913
A little private, so...

361
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:38,981
- did you really
sleep with that Dale guy?

362
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:40,850
I mean,
why would you do that?

363
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:41,885
- I know, right?

364
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:43,653
- You're way too hot for him.

365
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:45,354
- Who is this person?

366
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:46,790
- Byron.
What...?

367
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,525
- Byron.

368
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:49,659
It's just an opinion.

369
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,528
Um, do you guys want
this door closed?

370
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,463
Okay.
- Thank you.

371
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:54,464
- Yeah--

372
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:55,765
- Really?

373
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:57,434
- Okay, look,
I know you've had a rough day.

374
00:13:57,435 --> 00:14:00,069
I'm sorry,
but stop being a bitch, okay?

375
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,104
This is my place,
and that's my friend,

376
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:03,940
And we're going to hang out
and play some music.

377
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:05,241
You want to hang out?
Rad.

378
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:07,143
You don't, there's a coffee shop
down the street.

379
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:08,745
My house, my rules, missy.

380
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:11,448
- I cannot believe
how callous you're being.

381
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:16,319
Yes, you can.

382
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,287
Oh.

383
00:14:18,288 --> 00:14:19,989
There it is.

384
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:26,095
Good.

385
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:27,229
- Oh, listen to that one.

386
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,598
Ooh.

387
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,300
- High "c."
High "c!"

388
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:32,869
High "c."

389
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,370
Middle "c"
- Middle "c."

390
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:35,404
- High "c."

391
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:39,108
- Walt, shut up!

392
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:40,743
My God.

393
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:47,049
- Whoa.

394
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:53,656
- Whoa!

395
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:55,992
God.

396
00:14:55,993 --> 00:14:57,961
- God, it's late!
- Jesus!

397
00:14:57,962 --> 00:14:59,228
- Turn that light off.

398
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:00,396
- You scared the shit out of me.

399
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:01,498
What are you doing?

400
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:02,999
- I'm trying to sleep.

401
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,066
- No, I'm sleeping in here.

402
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,334
You're sleeping on the couch.

403
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:06,736
- Are you out of your mind?

404
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:07,904
This is my bed.

405
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:09,506
- Well, I'm not sleeping
in here with you.

406
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:10,507
- Why not?

407
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:11,741
- Because it's gross.

408
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:12,909
Because you're my brother.

409
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,377
And I don't want you
rolling over here

410
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:16,045
In the middle of the night
and touching me.

411
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:17,380
It's disturbing.

412
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:19,181
- Oh, well, I'm sorry
you find me so repulsive.

413
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:21,150
There's a sleeping bag
in the closet.

414
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:22,318
- Listen to me.

415
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:24,754
I've had a really,
really shitty day, okay?

416
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:26,088
And I haven't been sleeping
at all

417
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,457
Because you and creepy
have been playing

418
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,492
In your little band--

419
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:30,493
- Jamming!

420
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:31,761
- Oh, my God, okay.
Jamming.

421
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:33,195
- Whoa, no,
don't--Don't--Don't--

422
00:15:33,196 --> 00:15:34,296
Don't condescend to me, Syl.

423
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:35,464
Don't call it "A little band."

424
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:36,666
- Why are you being
such a dick?

425
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:37,901
I just want to get some sleep.

426
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:39,702
- Oh, my God, I'm not sleeping
on the couch

427
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:41,470
'Cause you don't want to share
the bed with me.

428
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:43,339
- Fine, I'm gonna
sleep on the couch.

429
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,340
- Fine by me.

430
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:45,542
- Fine.

431
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:47,476
- Oh, what?
No, no.

432
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:48,477
Not cool.

433
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:50,046
No.

434
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:51,047
Ah, you asshole.

435
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:53,182
- I'll take that.

436
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:54,350
- Ow!

437
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:03,927
- Oh, God.

438
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:04,961
Oh!

439
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:06,696
God!

440
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:09,566
- Wow.
- Ooh?

441
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,568
- You couldn't do that again
in a million years.

442
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:12,702
- Ow, ow, ow.

443
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:14,003
- Ouch, ow.

444
00:16:14,004 --> 00:16:17,574
Yeah, that smarts when
you hit your knee like that.

445
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:19,943
- Don't you have a home?

446
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:21,410
- Yeah, I live across the hall.

447
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:22,445
- Don't you sleep?

448
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:24,313
- Not much.

449
00:16:24,314 --> 00:16:26,315
- Okay, why are you here?

450
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:27,316
- I build websites.

451
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:29,085
My computer is busted.

452
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:30,954
So I told Walt that
if he let me use his,

453
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:32,288
I'll give him a cut
of the profits.

454
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:34,691
It's kind of
a win-win situation.

455
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:35,925
Brought you a coffee.

456
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:38,561
- Well, do you have to be here
all the time?

457
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:42,531
- Yeah, I have a strong
work ethic.

458
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:43,967
It's a vanilla latte.

459
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:47,637
You strike me like
a vanilla latte type.

460
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:49,538
- Aren't you insightful.

461
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:50,807
Thank you.

462
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,751
- So do you want to go out
with me sometime?

463
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:03,385
- sorry.

464
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:05,154
- Too soon?

465
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:06,956
- Um, yes.

466
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:09,859
Um, yeah, I've been single
for 26 hours.

467
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,228
So it's a little bit too soon.

468
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:14,230
- Well, the offer
is on the table.

469
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:15,464
- Okay.

470
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:17,133
- So what's next for you?

471
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:19,002
- What do you mean?

472
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:20,269
- What do I mean?

473
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,738
I mean, are you gonna get
another job?

474
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:23,172
You know, a tv job
or something else,

475
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:24,540
And what about a place?

476
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,609
I mean, are you gonna
find your own place eventually?

477
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,111
'Cause let's face it.

478
00:17:28,112 --> 00:17:30,113
Your brother's great,
but he's a little bit messy.

479
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:31,580
How long can you
live with him, right?

480
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:32,982
And then, what about your stuff?

481
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:35,051
You got all that stuff
at your ex-boyfriend's place.

482
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:36,853
The haircut, I mean,
you gonna let him keep it?

483
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:38,487
What are you gonna do with it?

484
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:39,689
You gonna move it into storage,

485
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,923
Or are you gonna
move it in here?

486
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:42,625
Although, I have no idea
where you'd put it.

487
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:43,726
It's pretty crammed.

488
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:45,128
And then you've got
your wardrobe,

489
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:46,796
Got these power suit
weather girl things.

490
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:48,998
You're gonna need to probably
do something about that--

491
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:50,299
- Okay,
you have to stop talking.

492
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,735
You're making my head hurt.

493
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,374
- You haven't thought about
this stuff.

494
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,976
- No, I haven't thought about
this stuff.

495
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:01,778
So I don't need you talking
about all the things

496
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:02,945
That I haven't thought about

497
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:04,814
Because I haven't
thought about them yet.

498
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:05,815
- I'm sorry.

499
00:18:05,816 --> 00:18:06,983
- I just woke up here.
- I know.

500
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:08,084
- And you're freaking me out.

501
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:09,085
- Didn't mean to.

502
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:10,153
- Well, you did.

503
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:11,620
- You know,
you're really attractive

504
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:13,156
When you get all riled up.

505
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:15,525
- Will you stop
flirting with me?

506
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:18,394
- Okay, but you might want
to put some pants on,

507
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:20,530
Because I can't be held
responsible for what I'm saying

508
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:21,931
When you're not wearing
any pants.

509
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:23,165
It's just distracting.

510
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,467
- God.

511
00:18:24,468 --> 00:18:27,269
- The kneesocks, though,
I love it.

512
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,542
- Okay.

513
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:35,879
Situation: not good.

514
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,981
You need to fix this
immediately.

515
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:41,651
You are a smart, capable woman.

516
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:44,487
And what you need--
Oh, you know what you need?

517
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:45,889
You need to make a list.

518
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,456
You need to make
a list of priorities

519
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:52,629
On how to get your life
together.

520
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,497
You can do this.

521
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:56,032
You are strong.

522
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,500
You need something
to write on.

523
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,573
Okay, I need some post-it notes.

524
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:07,710
What?

525
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,512
What?
What are you looking at?

526
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:10,780
Do I have something
on my face?

527
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:13,249
- Sis, are you familiar
with a device called a dvr?

528
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,250
- This isn't a good idea.

529
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:15,451
- What do you mean,
like, tivo?

530
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:16,586
- Tivo.

531
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:17,921
- I would back off.
She's fragile.

532
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,321
- We can digitally record
a program

533
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:20,957
And then watch it
at our convenience.

534
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,793
Now, I've done exactly that
with today's Seattle Morning.

535
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:25,662
- Why?
- Fallout.

536
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,530
- We thought there might
be some fallout.

537
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:29,666
- Yeah, I know.

538
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,067
- You may want to sit down here.

539
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,435
- Oh, my God.
- Byron.

540
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:34,136
- No, no-no-no.
I don't want to do it.

541
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,438
- You must.

542
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,373
- Go, Byron, go.

543
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:42,045
- And now I feel
we owe our viewers an apology.

544
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:44,380
- Well, I think you're right,
Dale.

545
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:46,515
- Yesterday, one of our
Seattle Morning team members

546
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:48,918
Had a bit of a, well,

547
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:50,386
I guess you could call it
an episode.

548
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:52,021
- An episode.
She did.

549
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:54,991
- Oh, I don't like her at all.

550
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:56,358
- She made a spectacle
of herself.

551
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,627
She talked about things

552
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:59,562
That are a bit of a no-no
on morning television,

553
00:19:59,563 --> 00:20:01,263
And she used some
terrible language.

554
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:03,299
- Well, we have kids watching.

555
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,734
- It's a morning show.

556
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,735
Families watch us.

557
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:07,536
They trust us.

558
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:08,638
We let them down.

559
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:09,639
- We sure did.

560
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,940
- Oh, stop it.
- Sorry.

561
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:12,942
- She also made some pretty
terrible accusations

562
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:13,943
Against you, Dale.

563
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:15,544
- Ah, yeah, she did.
She did.

564
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:17,213
It's true,
but I can take care of myself.

565
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:18,715
Those kids out there,

566
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:20,583
They can't take care
of themselves yet,

567
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:22,085
And that's where we
failed them.

568
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:23,385
- Oh, my God.

569
00:20:23,386 --> 00:20:25,154
- I'm not going to sit here
and defend myself,

570
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:28,124
My manhood,
against someone who...

571
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,258
- and here he goes.

572
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:31,127
- To say the least,
is frankly unstable.

573
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:33,630
- I would say that.
I would say that.

574
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:34,931
Well, you know what?

575
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:36,733
I think that I speak
for all of Seattle Morning

576
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:39,401
When I say,
good for you, Dale.

577
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:40,870
Good for you.

578
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:44,306
- Thanks, Sherry.

579
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:47,476
You out there,
our friends,

580
00:20:47,477 --> 00:20:49,178
Our neighbors,

581
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:51,213
We're sorry, Seattle.

582
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:54,583
We hope that we haven't
lost your trust.

583
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:55,584
- Oh, Seattle.

584
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:58,054
- The end.

585
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,030
- Think he's home?

586
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:08,131
- Oh, I know he's home.

587
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:09,465
It's time for
his after-show nap.

588
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:11,801
- Okay, your sister
is so hot.

589
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:13,069
- Dude.

590
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,845
This place is gay.

591
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:23,846
Up and at 'em, dickhead.

592
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,014
- Oh, my God!

593
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:26,049
- Whoa, whoa, Sylvia.

594
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,050
What are you doing here?

595
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:28,250
- What is she doing here?

596
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:29,952
- Oh, you guys are already
napping together.

597
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:30,953
That is so precious.

598
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:31,954
- Hi, asshole.

599
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:33,622
- Wow,
this is a great apartment.

600
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:34,924
- Oh, it's not an apartment.

601
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:36,092
It's a condo.

602
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:37,493
- Oh, my God.
They're gonna kill us.

603
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:38,661
- Yeah, that's right.

604
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:40,296
We're all part
of an elite hit squad.

605
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:41,630
- I'm Walt,
Sylvia's brother.

606
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:42,631
Remember me?

607
00:21:42,632 --> 00:21:43,700
We've met maybe ten times.

608
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:44,701
- Yeah, I do.

609
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:45,702
Hi, Walt.
How are you?

610
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:46,903
- Huh.
- I want my things, Dale.

611
00:21:46,904 --> 00:21:47,904
And I'm gonna take them.

612
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:49,305
- You can take your clothes,
Sylvia,

613
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:51,574
But I won't
be taken advantage of.

614
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:53,342
- Oh.
- Hmm.

615
00:21:53,343 --> 00:21:54,944
- What did you say?

616
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:56,645
- That probably wasn't
very smart, Dale.

617
00:21:56,646 --> 00:21:58,647
- You're not gonna be
taken advantage of?

618
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:00,049
- Badly worded, really.
- Exactly.

619
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,718
- You son of a bitch.

620
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,752
- Oh, shit!

621
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:05,054
- Taken advantage of?

622
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:06,555
- She's crazy!

623
00:22:06,556 --> 00:22:08,224
- Stop interrupting, Sherry.

624
00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:10,559
Stop talking.
I don't want to hurt you.

625
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,862
How long have you been sleeping
around behind my back, Dale?

626
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,263
- That's pretty cool, actually.

627
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:16,565
- How much of a fool
did I look like for you?

628
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:18,701
You think that I'm fucking
taking advantage?

629
00:22:18,702 --> 00:22:21,838
- Hands off the anchorpeople.

630
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,372
Be nice.
Play nice. Play nice.

631
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:24,540
- What's up?

632
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,943
- I am taking everything
I ever spent a penny on

633
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:27,944
Out of this apartment.

634
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:29,045
If you try to stop me,

635
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:30,646
I swear to God,
I will claw your eyes out.

636
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:31,848
Do you understand me?

637
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:33,950
Every single thing.

638
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:47,063
- What?
This is it?

639
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:48,064
- This is all your stuff.

640
00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:50,867
- I thought I had more stuff.

641
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:52,468
- It's kind of a hollow victory,
isn't it?

642
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:53,770
- Okay, shut up, Walt,
all right?

643
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:55,371
Can we go, please?

644
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:57,606
- Sylvia.

645
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:00,276
Can I talk to you
for a second?

646
00:23:00,277 --> 00:23:01,878
You just tried to kill me
in there.

647
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:05,414
The least you could do
is talk to me for a minute.

648
00:23:08,152 --> 00:23:09,752
- Go ahead, you guys.

649
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:11,487
Go.

650
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:13,156
Go.

651
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:14,157
- All right.

652
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:17,693
On the knees.

653
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:22,631
- What?

654
00:23:22,632 --> 00:23:23,766
- This is not all my fault.

655
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:24,801
- Oh, please.

656
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:26,235
- No, "Oh, please" you,
Sylvia.

657
00:23:26,236 --> 00:23:27,837
"Oh, please" you.

658
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:29,939
Okay.

659
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,307
I made love
to another woman.

660
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:34,010
I broke the rules.

661
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:38,447
Sorry.

662
00:23:38,448 --> 00:23:40,850
But you pushed me to it.

663
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:42,285
- I pushed you to it?

664
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:44,320
How did--
How did I do that?

665
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:46,422
- You never loved me.

666
00:23:46,423 --> 00:23:47,556
You never let me in.

667
00:23:47,557 --> 00:23:50,326
You never respected me.

668
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:51,493
I was okay for a time,

669
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:53,562
But you never stooped so low

670
00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:58,267
As to really allow yourself
to have feelings for me.

671
00:23:58,268 --> 00:24:00,903
I'm flesh and blood, Sylvia.

672
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:05,141
I want someone to want me
as much as I want them.

673
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:07,243
You're cold,

674
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:10,379
Sylvia.

675
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,481
You are cold.

676
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:15,718
And that's why I did
what I did.

677
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:25,361
- Said he only slept with her
because I didn't love him,

678
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:27,263
And he said that
I was cold.

679
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:30,066
Can you believe that?

680
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,467
Guys?

681
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:33,635
I mean, isn't that the craziest
thing you've ever heard?

682
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:35,204
That I'm cold?

683
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:37,639
- Well...

684
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,075
- oh, my God.

685
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:41,077
- You do sometimes
have a little trouble

686
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:42,811
Letting people in.

687
00:24:42,812 --> 00:24:44,347
- I never thought
you really loved him.

688
00:24:44,348 --> 00:24:45,948
- Oh, my God.
Me neither.

689
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:47,583
- I don't think she's been
in love since I've known her.

690
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:48,717
- What about the lawyer?

691
00:24:48,718 --> 00:24:50,419
- You mean the one she just
stopped calling?

692
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,653
- Oh, right.

693
00:24:51,654 --> 00:24:53,222
- That guy was the most
boring guy on the planet.

694
00:24:53,223 --> 00:24:54,223
- But he was a lawyer.

695
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:55,557
You could have given him
a chance.

696
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:56,658
- I don't believe this.

697
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:58,294
Are you telling me
that I'm cold?

698
00:24:58,295 --> 00:24:59,762
- No.
- No.

699
00:24:59,763 --> 00:25:02,398
- Honey, no.
You--You just--

700
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:03,900
- Maybe it's just difficult

701
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:06,135
For you to think
of loving someone.

702
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:07,603
- You've got walls.
- You do.

703
00:25:07,604 --> 00:25:10,139
Oh, oh, my God.
Brainstorm. Charles.

704
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,440
Charles.

705
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:12,608
- Oh, my God.
That's so crazy.

706
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:13,876
It just might work.

707
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:16,012
- Sylvia, he is perfect for you,
practically perfect.

708
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:17,813
He is very nice.

709
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:19,515
- Yeah, I don't think
that I'm ready to date.

710
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:20,783
- He works out at our gym.

711
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:22,718
- Yeah, he used to date maureen.
- You know maureen.

712
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:23,886
- Loud and stupid.
- Big girl.

713
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:25,087
- Yeah, but they're so done now.

714
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:26,088
- Yeah.

715
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:27,189
- You guys are crazy.

716
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,792
I just broke up with Dale,
like, yesterday.

717
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:32,361
- Okay, perhaps you think
you have nothing but time.

718
00:25:32,362 --> 00:25:33,396
- You don't.

719
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:34,430
- You don't, Sylvia.

720
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:36,032
You're in your late 30s.
- Mid 30s.

721
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,733
- You have a tiny window
remaining.

722
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:39,101
- Charles is an accountant.

723
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:40,803
He's stable.

724
00:25:40,804 --> 00:25:43,906
He's not gay,
and he's not not attractive.

725
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:45,141
- Not not attractive.

726
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:46,809
- This is your future
you're playing with.

727
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,110
- Yes, also a perfect
opportunity

728
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:49,645
To warm up that cold shoulder.

729
00:25:49,646 --> 00:25:51,547
- It wouldn't hurt if Dale
heard you were dating.

730
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:52,915
- No, wouldn't hurt at all.

731
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:54,984
Look, if you want to spend
your few remaining moments

732
00:25:54,985 --> 00:25:57,486
As an attractive middle-aged
woman being picky, go ahead.

733
00:25:57,487 --> 00:25:58,487
- Middle-aged?

734
00:25:58,488 --> 00:25:59,488
We are the same age.

735
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:00,823
- Yeah, and I'm married,

736
00:26:00,824 --> 00:26:02,825
And Jane's in a serious
relationship with a future.

737
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:05,161
And we both have careers
and ira accounts

738
00:26:05,162 --> 00:26:06,795
And our own apartments.

739
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:08,331
- And I'm actually only 34.

740
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:11,167
- Okay, look, all I'm saying is
that we're in the major leagues,

741
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:12,868
And you just got knocked back
to the minors.

742
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:13,970
- Is that a sports reference?

743
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:15,537
- I know, right?
I just came up with that.

744
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:16,538
- Look at that.

745
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:17,974
- Oh, shit, I got to go
pick up my kids.

746
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:19,675
- Oh, oh, God.
I've got pilates.

747
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:21,610
- Um, I will call Charles
and give him the rundown.

748
00:26:21,611 --> 00:26:22,811
- I will email him your picture.

749
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:25,047
Sylvia, he is gonna love you,
really.

750
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:26,482
- Did you valet?
- Totally.

751
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:27,483
- Bye, Syl.
- Okay.

752
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:28,484
- Bye.
- Okay.

753
00:26:28,485 --> 00:26:31,854
- Be strong, baby, yeah?

754
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:32,921
Bye, honey.

755
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,890
Wait a sec.
Wait a sec.

756
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,867
- So as you can see
from my resume,

757
00:26:44,868 --> 00:26:47,536
I've been working in television
since graduating college.

758
00:26:47,537 --> 00:26:49,672
And you know, I've done
a little bit of everything

759
00:26:49,673 --> 00:26:54,377
From reporting to color stories,
you know, whatever.

760
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:57,880
Why--Why--Why are you looking
at me like that?

761
00:26:57,881 --> 00:27:00,015
- You really lost it on
that morning show, didn't you?

762
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:01,784
I mean, you freaked out.

763
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:02,785
My staff loves it.

764
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:04,286
We watch it all the time.

765
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:06,989
Dale Waters, what an asshole.

766
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,391
- Everybody
in Seattle television

767
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:10,259
Knows Dale's an asshole.

768
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,360
Hell, I slept with him once

769
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:14,397
After some local
journalist dinner.

770
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:16,899
You were certainly right about
his disappointing performance.

771
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,634
Real high school stuff.

772
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:21,303
- ¶ argue about the things ¶

773
00:27:21,304 --> 00:27:23,539
¶ I should have left behind ¶

774
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,476
- Hmm.

775
00:27:27,477 --> 00:27:28,778
- Hey, yeah, tracy,

776
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:30,979
What was it that sassy weather
girl called Dale Waters?

777
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,980
- Oh, grabby.

778
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:33,382
- Grabby.

779
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:34,550
I bet he is.

780
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:35,751
What an asshole.

781
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:39,488
- ¶ dream up muddy river ¶

782
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:43,492
¶ underneath the drowsy moon ¶

783
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:49,832
- So you blew
the television gig,

784
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,635
And now you want
to get into radio?

785
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:55,504
- Well, I have an open mind.

786
00:27:55,505 --> 00:27:59,374
- Ah, isn't that big of you.

787
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,677
- ¶ past grocery stores ¶

788
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:03,245
- I love that you
ripped that guy apart.

789
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:04,346
I really do.

790
00:28:04,347 --> 00:28:06,248
Dale Waters is just south
of retarded.

791
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,116
Here's the problem.

792
00:28:08,117 --> 00:28:09,384
My anchors are assholes too,

793
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:11,754
And what's to keep you
from ripping them apart?

794
00:28:11,755 --> 00:28:13,288
- Yeah.

795
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:15,591
- Look, I feel for you.

796
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:17,960
But I don't know
what I can do.

797
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:19,728
You're a joke.

798
00:28:19,729 --> 00:28:22,064
If I put you on my staff,
that makes me a joke.

799
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:23,732
Hey, bill.

800
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:25,233
And I'm no joke.

801
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:26,669
Okay, give me the numbers.

802
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,704
- Ah, okay.
Well, we...

803
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:51,627
- Oh, Walt, stop it.

804
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:53,228
You're hurting my neck.

805
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:54,797
- Say you suck.
Say it!

806
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:55,931
- You suck!

807
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:56,932
No!

808
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:58,100
- Hey, kids.

809
00:28:58,101 --> 00:28:59,101
What's going on?

810
00:28:59,102 --> 00:29:00,302
- Look, look what she did.

811
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:01,336
She moved my bed out here.

812
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:03,005
She's taking my room.

813
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:04,439
- Yeah, I know.
I helped her move it.

814
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,841
- You--You--You helped her move?

815
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:07,510
Why does she get the room?

816
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:08,611
- Walt, she's a girl.

817
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:09,712
- I'm a girl.

818
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:11,246
- You brought my best friend
into this?

819
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:12,280
You suck.
You best--

820
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:13,749
- You're such an idiot.

821
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,350
I gave you back your bed.

822
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:16,919
- I live here, okay?

823
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,054
You can't just move all
my shit around in my apartment.

824
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:20,288
- This is a temporary situation.

825
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:21,690
- It doesn't matter, okay?

826
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:22,958
I'm not a little kid anymore.

827
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,259
You can't push me around.

828
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,995
- This is a much better
arrangement, Walt.

829
00:29:25,996 --> 00:29:27,062
- Says you.

830
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:29,632
I have got a system here,
you know?

831
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,667
- God, we have to live together.

832
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:34,269
- Okay, this is a temporary
situation.

833
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,838
You should be out
getting a fucking job,

834
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,439
Not rearranging my furniture.

835
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,975
- I have been looking
all week long.

836
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:44,413
- Oh, yeah.
How did it go?

837
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:45,681
What?

838
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:48,517
- Well, it was awful, Byron,
actually.

839
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:51,386
Every single person who looks
at me sees weather girl.

840
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:52,655
Everybody's calling me sassy,

841
00:29:52,656 --> 00:29:54,423
And I swear to God,
if one more person does it,

842
00:29:54,424 --> 00:29:56,124
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

843
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,793
I-I-lookit.
I am trying, okay?

844
00:29:57,794 --> 00:29:59,962
I don't like crowding your life
any more than you do.

845
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:01,630
- Well, you got to try harder.

846
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:03,799
- Really?
Oh, okay, thank you, Walt.

847
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,333
- Lower your standards.

848
00:30:05,334 --> 00:30:06,735
It's a tough job market.

849
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:07,803
- That's true.

850
00:30:07,804 --> 00:30:08,804
It is.

851
00:30:08,805 --> 00:30:10,039
- I have a college education.

852
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,473
- Join the club.

853
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:13,609
- I've had a coveted television
job in a class iI market.

854
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,010
- And you lost it.

855
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:16,612
- Oh, my God.
Why are you being such a dick?

856
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:18,313
- 'Cause you're acting like
a spoiled brat.

857
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:19,615
I went to college too, Syl.

858
00:30:19,616 --> 00:30:20,849
You know, I'm a temp.

859
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,651
Byron here went to grad school,

860
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:24,954
And he's renting my computer
to build websites.

861
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:26,388
- Philosophy major.

862
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:29,458
- Just grow up, Syl.
Grow up.

863
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:30,759
This is the world.

864
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,262
We don't always get to do
what we want to do.

865
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:41,570
- Oh, yeah, just go
and hang out in my room.

866
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:02,257
- So you don't have
much experience.

867
00:31:02,258 --> 00:31:03,592
- Well, in college...

868
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:06,729
- yeah, well,
that was a long time ago.

869
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,898
- It--Yeah,
it's like riding a bike.

870
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,334
- No, it's not.

871
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:13,669
All right, sally.

872
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,771
I'm gonna take a chance on you.

873
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:18,741
Don't make me regret it.

874
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:20,475
- It's--Sylvia.

875
00:31:20,476 --> 00:31:21,476
- What?

876
00:31:21,477 --> 00:31:23,112
- My name is Sylvia.

877
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:25,380
- Yeah, well, we do
the name tag thing tomorrow

878
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:26,448
Before your shift, okay?

879
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:28,117
There's an order to things.

880
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,152
- Got a process here.

881
00:31:30,153 --> 00:31:32,721
All right.

882
00:31:32,722 --> 00:31:34,690
This is your apron.

883
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:37,826
What are you doing?

884
00:31:37,827 --> 00:31:39,494
This is your responsibility.

885
00:31:39,495 --> 00:31:42,464
If you lose it,
you have to buy the next one.

886
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:45,233
And they're not cheap.

887
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:46,234
Take it.

888
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:47,936
- Oh, right.

889
00:31:47,937 --> 00:31:50,172
- Okay, show up tomorrow
with a wine key

890
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:51,273
And no less than five pens.

891
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:53,108
I do a staff check first thing,
all right?

892
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:54,543
And I shit you negative.

893
00:31:54,544 --> 00:31:55,844
You show up
without that wine key

894
00:31:55,845 --> 00:31:58,847
And less than five pens,

895
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:01,850
And I will send you home.

896
00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:05,420
Of this you can be sure.

897
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:06,989
Simpatico?

898
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:07,990
- Yes.

899
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:08,991
- Atta girl.

900
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:10,559
- Hmm.

901
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,061
- You get me some more coffee.

902
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:16,231
- Hey.

903
00:32:16,232 --> 00:32:18,167
- Hey.

904
00:32:18,168 --> 00:32:19,968
She here?

905
00:32:19,969 --> 00:32:23,939
- Bathroom.

906
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,341
Listen, can I be a dick?

907
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:28,110
Kind of get into your business
for a second?

908
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:32,447
- You don't know anything about
brothers and sisters, Byron.

909
00:32:32,448 --> 00:32:34,449
- Okay, yes, granted,
I am an only child.

910
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,517
I know nothing.

911
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:36,685
- Exactly.

912
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:38,153
- But as an only child,

913
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:40,288
I've always kind of envied
this whole sibling thing

914
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:41,623
That you have going on,
you know?

915
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:43,892
This whole sister thing's
kind of cool.

916
00:32:43,893 --> 00:32:45,894
She--
It's this whole other person

917
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:47,562
That kind of knows
everything about you.

918
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:48,997
She's been there
for all of these

919
00:32:48,998 --> 00:32:50,933
Really important moments
in your life,

920
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:52,968
These rearing moments.

921
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:56,805
And you know, I think that it's
a pretty important relationship

922
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:57,806
That--

923
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:59,808
- Byron.

924
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:01,343
- Okay, listen,

925
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:03,045
I'm not questioning your love

926
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:04,579
For your sister here at all,
okay?

927
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,248
I'm in absolute reverence of it,

928
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:11,653
But the fact is, she's a girl.

929
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:18,526
No, she's a girl
that just got dumped, okay?

930
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:23,866
Maybe cut her a little slack.

931
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:25,333
- Shut up, dude.

932
00:33:25,334 --> 00:33:27,669
- Fair enough.

933
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:31,940
- I think Byron's got
a thing for you.

934
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:33,075
- Yeah, I know.

935
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:35,343
He told me.

936
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:36,444
- What are you, uh,

937
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:39,181
What are you all done up for?

938
00:33:39,182 --> 00:33:42,350
- Well, I have a date.

939
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:43,585
I got a job today,

940
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:46,454
And you know,
I thought i'd treat myself.

941
00:33:46,455 --> 00:33:48,223
- Treat yourself?

942
00:33:48,224 --> 00:33:52,560
Who are you going
to treat yourself with?

943
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:55,630
- You're gonna make Byron
jealous.

944
00:33:59,368 --> 00:34:00,535
- Go.

945
00:34:00,536 --> 00:34:01,536
- Byron!

946
00:34:01,537 --> 00:34:02,537
- Right now.
Right now.

947
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:03,538
- Oh, I got her.

948
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:05,874
- Oh, God, Walt!

949
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:08,710
Ow!

950
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:09,912
- Yes?

951
00:34:09,913 --> 00:34:12,314
- Uh, is Sylvia here?

952
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:13,548
- Sylvia?
Hmm.

953
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:16,852
And who can I tell her
is calling?

954
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:17,853
- Charles.
- Ow. Ow. Ow.

955
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:19,454
- Charles, you sure?

956
00:34:19,455 --> 00:34:20,455
- Get off of me.

957
00:34:20,456 --> 00:34:22,191
- Sylvia, Charles is here.

958
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:24,126
- Charles is here!
Charles!

959
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:26,028
I am Walt,
Sylvia's brother and guardian.

960
00:34:26,029 --> 00:34:27,495
I have heard so much
about you.

961
00:34:27,496 --> 00:34:29,364
- She just raves on and on.

962
00:34:29,365 --> 00:34:31,266
- We hear you are
quite the lover.

963
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:34,436
- Top drawer, old man.
Top drawer.

964
00:34:34,437 --> 00:34:36,671
- Stop it.

965
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,406
Hi, Charles, sorry.

966
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:39,942
I'm Sylvia.
Nice to meet you.

967
00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:42,311
Pay no attention to the morons
in the doorway.

968
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:45,380
- It's, uh, nice to meet you
too, Sylvia.

969
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:48,851
Wow, you are just as beautiful
as you are on tv.

970
00:34:48,852 --> 00:34:50,685
- Mm, isn't she just?

971
00:34:50,686 --> 00:34:52,154
- Just an image of loveliness.

972
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:53,621
- Let's go.

973
00:34:53,622 --> 00:34:55,523
- Hey, don't you get fresh
with her, now.

974
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,926
No means no, suit man.

975
00:34:57,927 --> 00:35:00,028
- Who was that guy?

976
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:01,429
- Hmm.

977
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,365
Fire escape?

978
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:05,334
- Fire escape.

979
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:06,668
- I'm so sorry about them
up there.

980
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:08,036
- Oh, that's okay.

981
00:35:08,037 --> 00:35:09,938
Men like to bust each others'
balls on occasion,

982
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:11,673
But you know,
I can dish it out myself.

983
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:12,674
- Oh, I bet.

984
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:15,344
- So this is me.

985
00:35:15,345 --> 00:35:17,246
She's a beauty, isn't she?

986
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:19,214
- Charles, can I just say
nice ride?

987
00:35:19,215 --> 00:35:21,683
Classy yet understated.

988
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:23,585
- What's the gas mileage
on something like that?

989
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:24,920
I'm just curious
because you know

990
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:26,755
That we do have a responsibility
to the planet.

991
00:35:26,756 --> 00:35:27,956
- You know what?
You know what?

992
00:35:27,957 --> 00:35:29,191
Cut him some slack, Byron.

993
00:35:29,192 --> 00:35:30,959
That thing's a pussy magnet,
am I right, huh?

994
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,528
- Can we go, please?

995
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:34,997
- Charles, buddy,
am I right?

996
00:35:34,998 --> 00:35:36,531
Those seats have seen
a little action.

997
00:35:36,532 --> 00:35:40,402
- He's being coy.
Come on.

998
00:35:40,403 --> 00:35:42,438
- Oh, there it is.
- All right.

999
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:45,474
- Who let the dog out?

1000
00:35:45,475 --> 00:35:48,110
- "Who let the dog out"?

1001
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,482
- So is it weird
to be a celebrity?

1002
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:56,552
- Oh, I'm not really
a celebrity.

1003
00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:57,953
- You totally are.

1004
00:35:57,954 --> 00:36:01,856
I mean, look, it's like everyone
here is staring at us.

1005
00:36:01,857 --> 00:36:03,792
We're just, you know...

1006
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:05,894
gives me goose pimples.

1007
00:36:05,895 --> 00:36:08,697
- Okay.

1008
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:11,900
- So what would you like
to do next?

1009
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:12,934
Talk show?

1010
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:14,069
Talk show.

1011
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,905
I bet you would be
great in that.

1012
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:20,075
Um, uh, like the, uh,
like the--The Sally Jessy

1013
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:22,344
But--But you know, hot.

1014
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:24,846
- I don't know.

1015
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:30,586
You know, I'm sort of exploring
my options right now, I guess.

1016
00:36:30,587 --> 00:36:32,254
- Can I be honest with you
about something?

1017
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:35,157
- Sure.

1018
00:36:35,158 --> 00:36:38,560
- Emily told me about
your walls.

1019
00:36:38,561 --> 00:36:42,063
- M-M-My walls?
What?

1020
00:36:42,064 --> 00:36:45,066
- The walls built around this.

1021
00:36:45,067 --> 00:36:47,202
Right here.

1022
00:36:47,203 --> 00:36:48,937
Well, well, guess what?

1023
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:50,972
Guess what, kid?

1024
00:36:50,973 --> 00:36:52,874
I've got them too.

1025
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:58,447
And they are tall
and, you know, made of stone.

1026
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:03,118
But, uh, since I met you,
Sylvia,

1027
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,686
You have torn down my walls.

1028
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:06,588
- Oh.

1029
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:08,957
I didn't mean to.

1030
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:10,025
- You know, and I think

1031
00:37:10,026 --> 00:37:12,994
I see that yours
are tumbling as well.

1032
00:37:12,995 --> 00:37:14,563
Am I right?

1033
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:15,964
Okay, okay, okay.

1034
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:18,033
Let's just--Let's just get down
to business, Sylvia.

1035
00:37:18,034 --> 00:37:19,568
I want to fast-track this thing.

1036
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:22,070
I want a family:

1037
00:37:22,071 --> 00:37:27,209
A wife, two kids,
a boy and a girl,

1038
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,578
Lucius and ariel.

1039
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:34,716
I want to sell my townhouse
and get a real home,

1040
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:39,221
A home with a woman's touch.

1041
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:42,357
- Okay, now you're just
scaring me.

1042
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:43,958
- Yeah, that's--
That's what I'm saying.

1043
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:47,396
I'm saying, you know,
the future is scary.

1044
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:50,732
But not if you've got
someone to hold.

1045
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:56,638
Okay, what I need
is someone to complement me.

1046
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,007
I want my friends
to look at my girl

1047
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:04,613
And say, "Whoa, look at that
hot babe with the 'c' man."

1048
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:05,814
Yeah, you know?

1049
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:07,282
- Yeah, yeah,
yeah, you know,

1050
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:10,619
I think we might be looking
for different things, Charles.

1051
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:12,754
Let's not be coy here.

1052
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:14,789
Neither one of us are kids.

1053
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,792
I know what I want,
and I'm putting it out there.

1054
00:38:17,793 --> 00:38:20,395
Do you know what you want?

1055
00:38:52,262 --> 00:38:53,262
- Hey.

1056
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:55,530
Jesus.

1057
00:38:55,531 --> 00:38:57,633
Again?

1058
00:38:57,634 --> 00:39:00,769
- Sorry.

1059
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,271
Good date?

1060
00:39:03,406 --> 00:39:06,408
Well, yeah, he did propose.

1061
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:09,911
He's also probably the creepiest
person on the planet, so...

1062
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:11,212
- that's so weird.

1063
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:15,884
I mean, it seemed like
you guys were such a good match.

1064
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:18,920
So did the two of you do it?

1065
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,057
No.

1066
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:25,260
All right, I am going to bed.

1067
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:27,962
- I don't get it.

1068
00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:30,732
- Get what?

1069
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:33,735
- I mean, I just don't get
how you could go out

1070
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:36,405
On some dumb date
with some dumb guy

1071
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:41,777
When it's so clear
that I have a thing for you.

1072
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:43,011
I mean, if you want to,
you know,

1073
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:44,446
Get married or move in
with someone

1074
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:46,915
Then you're probably
barking up the wrong tree,

1075
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:50,752
But I do think
I'm a pretty good rebound guy.

1076
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:56,625
- Mm, and you are offering
your services to me.

1077
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:59,528
- Yeah,
something like that.

1078
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:03,064
But I just think
that I am exactly what you need

1079
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:05,334
At this crossroads
in your life.

1080
00:40:05,335 --> 00:40:07,769
- Do you?

1081
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,738
Wow, you're really
fond of yourself, aren't you?

1082
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:10,905
- Oh, come on.
Give me a break.

1083
00:40:10,906 --> 00:40:12,374
You're in love with yourself.

1084
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,742
You think you might be,

1085
00:40:13,743 --> 00:40:15,577
Like, the most awesome
person ever.

1086
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:17,446
- Okay, how old are you?

1087
00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:19,514
- 30.

1088
00:40:19,515 --> 00:40:21,350
Next year.

1089
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:22,484
- Hmm, okay, well,

1090
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:25,186
Let me tell you something,
30 next year.

1091
00:40:25,187 --> 00:40:26,588
You don't know me.

1092
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:27,922
You don't know anything
about me,

1093
00:40:27,923 --> 00:40:31,192
And you certainly don't know
what I need in my life.

1094
00:40:31,193 --> 00:40:32,794
- Mm-Hmm.

1095
00:40:32,795 --> 00:40:34,529
You know what I like
about you best?

1096
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,797
- I don't care.

1097
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:37,131
- You're difficult.

1098
00:40:37,132 --> 00:40:38,132
- Oh.

1099
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:39,368
- And you're very sexy

1100
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:41,035
But in this foreign film
kind of way

1101
00:40:41,036 --> 00:40:43,104
With the angles
and the attitude.

1102
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:46,408
I dig it.

1103
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:50,545
Go home, Byron.

1104
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,634
You know, you don't
not have a point.

1105
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:14,369
- Everybody needs a rebound guy.

1106
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,670
- I mean, you know,
why do I need

1107
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:17,739
To audition men for it
when I know exactly what I need?

1108
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,708
- That is exactly my point.

1109
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:22,911
- Somebody who's uncomplicated,
convenient,

1110
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:25,146
Totally wrong for me,
and somebody who I could never

1111
00:41:25,147 --> 00:41:28,417
In, like, a million years
have any real feelings for.

1112
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:31,052
- Except for the ravenous
animal attraction.

1113
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:32,788
- No obligations.
No complications.

1114
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:34,956
No expectations.

1115
00:41:34,957 --> 00:41:39,093
- That's pretty much
how I live my life.

1116
00:41:39,094 --> 00:41:43,598
So...

1117
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,935
- okay, um,
raise your right hand.

1118
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:48,303
- Raise?

1119
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:49,304
Okay.

1120
00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:50,405
- Okay, repeat after me.

1121
00:41:50,406 --> 00:41:53,374
I, Byron...

1122
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:55,510
- oh, wow, you don't even
know my last name?

1123
00:41:55,511 --> 00:41:57,045
Okay, that's great.

1124
00:41:57,046 --> 00:42:02,651
- I, Byron, promise to never
fall in love with Sylvia,

1125
00:42:02,652 --> 00:42:05,353
No matter how awesome
she may be.

1126
00:42:05,354 --> 00:42:09,724
- I, Byron, promise that
if one of us breaks this deal,

1127
00:42:09,725 --> 00:42:11,225
It's not gonna be me.

1128
00:42:11,226 --> 00:42:12,360
- Oh, it's not gonna be me.

1129
00:42:12,361 --> 00:42:13,428
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

1130
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:14,663
- Yep.

1131
00:42:14,664 --> 00:42:16,565
- Okay, you gonna kiss me,
or you gonna be clever?

1132
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:18,867
- I'm going to kiss you.

1133
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:20,101
- Okay, soon, you think?

1134
00:42:20,102 --> 00:42:21,436
- I'm just building
the tension--

1135
00:42:21,437 --> 00:42:22,537
- Oh, my God.

1136
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:29,911
- Wow, okay.

1137
00:42:31,347 --> 00:42:33,682
Wait, hold on, okay.

1138
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:39,788
Okay, there's--
Whoa, uh.

1139
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:41,222
- Oh.
- Hmm.

1140
00:42:41,223 --> 00:42:42,290
- Oh, no.

1141
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:44,359
- That looks really
uncomfortable.

1142
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,895
- We can go back in there.
- Okay.

1143
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:49,364
- Let me take this off.

1144
00:42:52,368 --> 00:42:54,435
When did I start wanting you?

1145
00:42:54,436 --> 00:42:56,270
- My guess is that you probably
always wanted me

1146
00:42:56,271 --> 00:42:58,172
And that you just forgot.

1147
00:42:58,173 --> 00:42:59,841
- I don't really think so.

1148
00:42:59,842 --> 00:43:01,877
- It's just at theory, really.

1149
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:07,782
Yeah, there.

1150
00:43:07,783 --> 00:43:09,818
Unbutton, unbutton.

1151
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:15,056
- I can't.
Help me.

1152
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:16,090
- There.

1153
00:43:16,091 --> 00:43:17,325
- Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

1154
00:43:17,326 --> 00:43:18,359
- Wait, what?

1155
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,594
- Don't tell Walt, okay?

1156
00:43:19,595 --> 00:43:20,762
- What?

1157
00:43:20,763 --> 00:43:22,531
- Oh, seriously,
that's another condition.

1158
00:43:22,532 --> 00:43:23,532
You can't tell Walt.

1159
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:24,799
- What are you talking about?

1160
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,200
You want me to lie
to my best friend?

1161
00:43:26,201 --> 00:43:27,268
I can't, no, come on.

1162
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:28,737
- What?
No, I'm lying to my brother.

1163
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:31,606
- Totally, totally
not the same thing at all.

1164
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:33,742
No, no, I'm sorry.

1165
00:43:33,743 --> 00:43:35,176
I can't do that.

1166
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:38,580
I'm sorry.

1167
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:41,550
- Okay.

1168
00:43:41,551 --> 00:43:42,551
- What?

1169
00:43:42,552 --> 00:43:44,953
- Okay.

1170
00:43:44,954 --> 00:43:46,788
That's a shame.

1171
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:48,590
- Yeah.

1172
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:49,958
This could have been fun.

1173
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:51,593
- Could have.

1174
00:43:51,594 --> 00:43:52,661
- Probably would have been.

1175
00:43:52,662 --> 00:43:55,997
- I think so, yeah.

1176
00:44:05,107 --> 00:44:11,212
Well, uh, I hope things
don't get weird after this.

1177
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:14,716
- Well, nothing happened,
so...

1178
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:15,884
- yeah, I'm sure.

1179
00:44:15,885 --> 00:44:19,420
Yeah, except that,
but whatever.

1180
00:44:19,421 --> 00:44:23,191
- Yeah.

1181
00:44:23,192 --> 00:44:24,793
- Yeah, sweet dreams.

1182
00:44:24,794 --> 00:44:26,728
- Okay.

1183
00:44:32,935 --> 00:44:34,636
- Not telling him
isn't necessarily lying.

1184
00:44:34,637 --> 00:44:35,870
- It's like an omission.

1185
00:44:35,871 --> 00:44:37,806
- Totally different thing.
- Totally different.

1186
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:38,974
- Come here.

1187
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:40,308
- ¶ dit, dit, ditty
now hit and run ¶

1188
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:43,011
¶ you can dit, dit, ditty
until I'm done ¶

1189
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:44,079
¶ come along dit, ditty ¶

1190
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:50,218
¶ till the boy's
a broken thing ¶

1191
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:53,622
- Oh, my God.

1192
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:56,625
Okay, you two ready?

1193
00:44:56,626 --> 00:44:58,326
- Yeah.

1194
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:00,929
- I think I'll have the--

1195
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:02,063
- It's you.

1196
00:45:02,064 --> 00:45:03,865
Arthur, it's her.

1197
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:04,866
- Her who?

1198
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:06,434
- Her, sassy weather girl,
right?

1199
00:45:06,435 --> 00:45:07,636
It's you, isn't it?

1200
00:45:07,637 --> 00:45:09,938
Sylvia, what is it?
Velasquez?

1201
00:45:09,939 --> 00:45:13,407
- Uh, no.
My name is Margot.

1202
00:45:13,408 --> 00:45:14,843
- Ah.

1203
00:45:14,844 --> 00:45:16,077
Name tag says, "Sylvia."

1204
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:18,847
- You are so busted.

1205
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:20,348
- Sorry.

1206
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:22,851
Oh, this is what
you're doing now, huh?

1207
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:24,185
That is really sad.

1208
00:45:24,186 --> 00:45:25,854
- So what can I get you folks?

1209
00:45:25,855 --> 00:45:27,656
- You couldn't get a job
anywhere else?

1210
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:29,590
- Well, it's not like there
aren't a million people

1211
00:45:29,591 --> 00:45:30,892
Who can read the weather section

1212
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:32,794
And then ramble on about it
on some morning show.

1213
00:45:32,795 --> 00:45:34,162
- Arthur.
- I mean, come on.

1214
00:45:34,163 --> 00:45:36,397
It's not exactly hard-hitting
journalism or anything.

1215
00:45:36,398 --> 00:45:39,968
- Well...sorry.

1216
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:40,969
- Damn it.

1217
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:41,970
- I am so sorry.

1218
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:43,138
- You did that on purpose.

1219
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:45,273
- Oh, no,
I did not do that on--

1220
00:45:45,274 --> 00:45:47,408
I am hurt by that accusation.

1221
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:49,243
- No, you're sassy.

1222
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:50,545
Duh, everybody says so,

1223
00:45:50,546 --> 00:45:52,647
And that was a very sassy thing
for you to do.

1224
00:45:52,648 --> 00:45:55,150
- You know, why don't I just get
you guys a new server?

1225
00:45:55,151 --> 00:45:56,450
- Yeah, why don't you?

1226
00:45:56,451 --> 00:45:59,253
- Great, sassy.

1227
00:45:59,254 --> 00:46:00,521
Unbelievable.

1228
00:46:00,522 --> 00:46:02,190
- Oh, smoking.

1229
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:05,160
- Oh.
- Oh, whatever.

1230
00:46:05,161 --> 00:46:06,861
Do over.
Do over.

1231
00:46:06,862 --> 00:46:11,733
- Advantage, Byron.

1232
00:46:11,734 --> 00:46:13,267
- It's just--
It's a flick of the wrist.

1233
00:46:13,268 --> 00:46:14,569
- Down in front.

1234
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:16,237
- It's a flick of the wrist,
and it's just--

1235
00:46:16,238 --> 00:46:17,538
- Oh, it's a save.

1236
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:19,107
- See that's--
And that's what happens.

1237
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:20,441
- You know what?

1238
00:46:20,442 --> 00:46:22,276
- That's what happens
when you don't practice.

1239
00:46:22,277 --> 00:46:24,079
That's what happens
when you don't practice.

1240
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,313
- Point.

1241
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:28,516
- Serve.
- Serve it.

1242
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:30,151
- Oh, just lob it up there
for me.

1243
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:31,619
- Just shove it down
your throat.

1244
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,855
- A little side...

1245
00:46:33,856 --> 00:46:36,257
um, hey, I'm--
I'm just gonna--

1246
00:46:36,258 --> 00:46:37,258
I'm gonna be right back.

1247
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:38,326
Keep working on it, though.

1248
00:46:38,327 --> 00:46:39,460
- Yeah, knock yourself out.

1249
00:46:39,461 --> 00:46:41,629
Service.

1250
00:46:46,535 --> 00:46:48,870
Point.

1251
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:49,838
Point.

1252
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:58,346
- Excuse me.

1253
00:46:58,347 --> 00:47:00,581
Okay, what do we have here?

1254
00:47:00,582 --> 00:47:02,217
Okay, guys, wait,
table 21.

1255
00:47:02,218 --> 00:47:03,417
We still need the soup.

1256
00:47:03,418 --> 00:47:05,019
- Yeah, bonita.

1257
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,821
Te amo.

1258
00:47:06,822 --> 00:47:10,558
- Sylvia, quiero hacerte
el amor todo el dia.

1259
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,361
- No, hombre, necesita
un hombre como yo.

1260
00:47:13,362 --> 00:47:16,131
- Para eso me tiene a mi.
¿Verdad, mi amor?

1261
00:47:16,132 --> 00:47:17,698
Va a ser mio ese culi--

1262
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:19,667
- Okay, give me my soup.

1263
00:47:19,668 --> 00:47:21,335
- Ay, quiere su sopa...
cremosa, cremosa.

1264
00:47:21,336 --> 00:47:22,670
- Oh, my God.

1265
00:47:23,672 --> 00:47:25,439
The kitchen staff hates me.

1266
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
- Of course they do.

1267
00:47:26,441 --> 00:47:27,642
- I'm sure they don't hate you.

1268
00:47:27,643 --> 00:47:28,843
- They probably do.

1269
00:47:28,844 --> 00:47:30,711
- They talk dirty to me
in spanish.

1270
00:47:30,712 --> 00:47:32,013
- Oh, yeah?
Is it hot?

1271
00:47:32,014 --> 00:47:34,315
Wait, no.

1272
00:47:34,316 --> 00:47:35,316
I don't want to know.

1273
00:47:35,317 --> 00:47:36,617
- But don't you speak spanish?

1274
00:47:36,618 --> 00:47:38,653
- I don't want them
to know that.

1275
00:47:38,654 --> 00:47:40,088
- Why not?

1276
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:41,923
- 'Cause then they'll want
to talk all the time.

1277
00:47:41,924 --> 00:47:43,158
- No.

1278
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:44,159
Yeah.

1279
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,160
- Snob.

1280
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:46,161
- I am a snob.

1281
00:47:46,162 --> 00:47:47,495
- No.

1282
00:47:47,496 --> 00:47:49,998
You're a work in progress.

1283
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:55,469
- Think I can be a secret agent?

1284
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:57,105
No.

1285
00:47:57,106 --> 00:47:58,840
- Yeah.

1286
00:48:02,845 --> 00:48:04,846
- Sorry.

1287
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:07,048
Hey, guys, table 12's still
waiting on their chicken.

1288
00:48:07,049 --> 00:48:11,786
- AquI tengo tu pollo, guerita.

1289
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:12,787
- Okay.

1290
00:48:12,788 --> 00:48:18,526
¿Donde diablos esta mI pollo?

1291
00:48:22,164 --> 00:48:24,199
A semester in college.

1292
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,300
- Habla español, la guerita.

1293
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:26,500
- It's not bad, right?

1294
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:28,736
- It's okay.

1295
00:48:28,737 --> 00:48:29,737
- Hey.

1296
00:48:29,738 --> 00:48:30,738
- Hey.
- Hi.

1297
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:31,840
We got to hurry up.

1298
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:33,341
Walt's coming home
in a half hour.

1299
00:48:36,178 --> 00:48:38,713
Have you noticed
how much sex we're having?

1300
00:48:38,714 --> 00:48:40,414
- Is that a problem?

1301
00:48:40,415 --> 00:48:42,450
- No, of course not.

1302
00:48:42,451 --> 00:48:43,818
I love sex.

1303
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:45,720
I'm glad that you love sex
as much as I love sex

1304
00:48:45,721 --> 00:48:46,921
Because i, certainly, I do.

1305
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:48,223
I love sex.

1306
00:48:48,224 --> 00:48:50,058
- Well, let's look at it
objectively.

1307
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:52,193
I have a shitty job.

1308
00:48:52,194 --> 00:48:53,561
Mooch off my brother.

1309
00:48:53,562 --> 00:48:56,231
I have no place
to call my own.

1310
00:48:56,232 --> 00:48:57,765
Pretty much, my life sucks.

1311
00:48:57,766 --> 00:49:01,635
So sex is the only thing
I have to look forward to.

1312
00:49:01,636 --> 00:49:04,939
It's pretty much the only thing
good in my life.

1313
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,507
- Wow.
- Yeah, right?

1314
00:49:06,508 --> 00:49:10,211
Too bad it's with
an emotionally unavailable,

1315
00:49:10,212 --> 00:49:14,082
Financially devoid,
peter pan syndrome,

1316
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:17,118
Rock star wannabe
12-Year-Old.

1317
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,119
- Ouch.

1318
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,453
- Yeah, but the sex
is really good.

1319
00:49:19,454 --> 00:49:20,855
- That is true.

1320
00:49:25,294 --> 00:49:26,727
- Oh, what the fuck!

1321
00:49:26,728 --> 00:49:28,363
oh, fuck!

1322
00:49:28,364 --> 00:49:29,898
What?
Oh!

1323
00:49:29,899 --> 00:49:31,165
Fuck!
That's my sister, man!

1324
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:32,400
Come on,
what the hell are you--

1325
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:34,269
Oh, oh, come on.

1326
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,569
That's my--I'm fucking blind.

1327
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,005
I'm fucking--I'm just--
I'm blind.

1328
00:49:37,006 --> 00:49:38,472
I'm blind.

1329
00:49:38,473 --> 00:49:40,641
I'm gonna have that image
burned into my brain for life.

1330
00:49:40,642 --> 00:49:42,110
What are you--
This is my living room!

1331
00:49:42,111 --> 00:49:43,111
I live in this room!

1332
00:49:43,112 --> 00:49:45,346
What's--Ah.
We--Oh!

1333
00:49:45,347 --> 00:49:46,347
Fuck!

1334
00:49:49,618 --> 00:49:52,186
So how long has this
been going on?

1335
00:49:52,187 --> 00:49:55,189
- A while.
- Not long.

1336
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:56,690
- I see.

1337
00:49:56,691 --> 00:49:59,760
And you didn't feel this was
pertinent information to share?

1338
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:02,397
- What I do is none
of your business, Walt.

1339
00:50:02,398 --> 00:50:03,731
- Interesting.

1340
00:50:03,732 --> 00:50:06,567
Because that was my bed
that you were fornicating on,

1341
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:08,736
And that was my friend
with which you were fornicating.

1342
00:50:08,737 --> 00:50:09,737
Huh.

1343
00:50:09,738 --> 00:50:10,939
- Look, Walt.

1344
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,407
I am sorry
that I didn't tell you, man.

1345
00:50:12,408 --> 00:50:13,507
I'm sorry.

1346
00:50:13,508 --> 00:50:15,910
- I am so not even
talking to you yet.

1347
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:18,646
Look, Byron's my friend,

1348
00:50:18,647 --> 00:50:20,381
And now the only reason
he comes over here

1349
00:50:20,382 --> 00:50:21,382
Is to see you.

1350
00:50:21,383 --> 00:50:22,883
- That is not true.

1351
00:50:22,884 --> 00:50:25,619
- Hey, the big kids are talking.

1352
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,821
I don't know if you've noticed,

1353
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:28,722
But I don't really have
an abundance of friends.

1354
00:50:28,723 --> 00:50:30,558
All right, so if you fuck up
my only friendship,

1355
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:31,725
I'm going to be pissed.

1356
00:50:31,726 --> 00:50:33,461
- No friendships are getting
ruined, okay?

1357
00:50:33,462 --> 00:50:34,862
It's not like that.

1358
00:50:34,863 --> 00:50:38,632
- And you, what exactly are your
intentions toward my sister?

1359
00:50:38,633 --> 00:50:39,834
'Cause if you haven't noticed,

1360
00:50:39,835 --> 00:50:41,535
She's kind of
in a vulnerable place.

1361
00:50:41,536 --> 00:50:42,603
- Oh, my God, Walt.

1362
00:50:42,604 --> 00:50:45,806
- Okay, my intentions
are honorable.

1363
00:50:45,807 --> 00:50:47,308
- There are no intentions.

1364
00:50:47,309 --> 00:50:48,576
We're just messing around.

1365
00:50:48,577 --> 00:50:51,245
There is no commitment,
no emotions.

1366
00:50:51,246 --> 00:50:54,282
We're just two friends
who are sleeping together.

1367
00:50:55,817 --> 00:50:57,718
Right.

1368
00:51:01,123 --> 00:51:03,324
- Yeah, that always works.

1369
00:51:03,325 --> 00:51:05,626
Good luck with that.

1370
00:51:09,465 --> 00:51:10,764
- Paul.

1371
00:51:15,637 --> 00:51:19,507
Juan.

1372
00:51:19,508 --> 00:51:21,775
Ah, Sylvia.

1373
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:24,645
- Putos impuestos.

1374
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:27,482
La pinche miseria que me pagas,
¿y luego me quitas la mitad?

1375
00:51:27,483 --> 00:51:29,250
Vayanse al pinche diablo.

1376
00:51:29,251 --> 00:51:30,651
- What did he say?

1377
00:51:30,652 --> 00:51:33,587
- Uh, he's just upset
about the taxes.

1378
00:51:33,588 --> 00:51:35,056
- Yeah, well,
that's the price you pay

1379
00:51:35,057 --> 00:51:38,026
For living in the best damn
country in the world, amigo.

1380
00:51:38,027 --> 00:51:40,528
- Eres una rata sucia,
hija de la chingada.

1381
00:51:40,529 --> 00:51:42,863
- What?
What is he saying?

1382
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:44,732
- Son of a bitch.
What?

1383
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:45,733
I can't live off of this.

1384
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:46,934
- Well, maybe you should pick up

1385
00:51:46,935 --> 00:51:49,037
A couple more shifts,
princess, huh?

1386
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:50,338
You got a one top out there.

1387
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:51,605
- Wait, no, we're closed.

1388
00:51:51,606 --> 00:51:53,174
J.D., juan already
shut down the grill.

1389
00:51:53,175 --> 00:51:54,642
- We are open
till I say we're closed.

1390
00:51:54,643 --> 00:51:56,610
Okay, and we are still open.

1391
00:51:56,611 --> 00:51:58,146
Get your one top.

1392
00:51:59,548 --> 00:52:01,082
- La odio.

1393
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:03,384
- Esa, esa no tiene madre.

1394
00:52:03,385 --> 00:52:05,819
- Yes, that's exactly
what it is.

1395
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:26,074
- Hey.

1396
00:52:26,075 --> 00:52:28,209
- Hey.

1397
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,444
What are you doing here?

1398
00:52:30,445 --> 00:52:32,813
- Well, first of all...

1399
00:52:32,814 --> 00:52:34,148
- flower for me.

1400
00:52:34,149 --> 00:52:35,917
- Yeah, I picked them myself.

1401
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:39,987
- From the vase on the table.

1402
00:52:39,988 --> 00:52:45,059
- No idea what you're
talking about.

1403
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:49,430
So listen, you want to go
on a date with me?

1404
00:52:49,431 --> 00:52:50,932
- A date with you.

1405
00:52:50,933 --> 00:52:55,102
- A date with me.

1406
00:52:55,103 --> 00:52:58,039
- Well, you know, I still have
to do my side work and stuff,

1407
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,542
And I'm kind of tired.

1408
00:53:01,543 --> 00:53:02,643
- Oh, yeah, no.

1409
00:53:02,644 --> 00:53:03,644
I'm sorry.

1410
00:53:03,645 --> 00:53:06,513
Side work, of course.

1411
00:53:06,514 --> 00:53:08,249
Okay, in that case,

1412
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,584
Then I'm going to start
with the cheese sticks.

1413
00:53:10,585 --> 00:53:13,120
I hear they're
really great here.

1414
00:53:13,121 --> 00:53:16,090
And then maybe just
a filet mignon, no onions,

1415
00:53:16,091 --> 00:53:17,358
Well-Done.

1416
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:22,029
You know, I really like
to slow cook it, the juice.

1417
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:24,698
And then for dessert,
you know,

1418
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:25,866
I'm gonna hold off on dessert.

1419
00:53:25,867 --> 00:53:27,168
See how I feel afterwards.

1420
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:28,970
Probably gonna be a brulee,
but I don't know.

1421
00:53:28,971 --> 00:53:30,537
It might be a baked alaska
at this point.

1422
00:53:30,538 --> 00:53:32,906
Suzette, wow, I don't know.

1423
00:53:32,907 --> 00:53:35,876
We'll figure that out after.

1424
00:53:35,877 --> 00:53:40,114
Or you could just
go on a date with me.

1425
00:53:40,115 --> 00:53:42,516
- Yeah, let's do that.

1426
00:53:42,517 --> 00:53:43,684
- Okay.
- Okay.

1427
00:53:43,685 --> 00:53:44,685
- I'll wait here.

1428
00:53:44,686 --> 00:53:46,253
- Okay.

1429
00:53:52,227 --> 00:53:53,627
- Yeah, but what I love to do

1430
00:53:53,628 --> 00:53:56,097
Is imagine
the two of you as kids.

1431
00:53:56,098 --> 00:53:57,098
- Oh, yeah?

1432
00:53:57,099 --> 00:53:58,765
And how does that work out?

1433
00:53:58,766 --> 00:54:00,434
- Well, it's pretty funny
actually,

1434
00:54:00,435 --> 00:54:03,937
Because, you know,
you, you're very cute,

1435
00:54:03,938 --> 00:54:06,073
But you've got this vicious
mean streak.

1436
00:54:06,074 --> 00:54:07,108
- Mean streak?

1437
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:08,976
- Oh, yeah, totally mean.

1438
00:54:08,977 --> 00:54:10,777
Yeah, messing with the toys.

1439
00:54:10,778 --> 00:54:12,380
You got the--You're still cute.

1440
00:54:12,381 --> 00:54:13,381
You got the pigtails.

1441
00:54:13,382 --> 00:54:14,382
- What about Walt?

1442
00:54:14,383 --> 00:54:15,649
He's the mean one.

1443
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:19,253
- No, Walt I have trouble
imagining as a kid.

1444
00:54:19,254 --> 00:54:22,056
- Okay, he was really,
really ugly,

1445
00:54:22,057 --> 00:54:24,091
And he had this huge head.

1446
00:54:24,092 --> 00:54:26,360
It was like--
He looked like a Walt puppet.

1447
00:54:26,361 --> 00:54:28,962
- Well, I mean, he still has
a pretty big head.

1448
00:54:28,963 --> 00:54:31,132
You're going to need to show me
pictures of that, though.

1449
00:54:31,133 --> 00:54:32,133
- No, no pictures.

1450
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:33,267
- Oh, come on.

1451
00:54:33,268 --> 00:54:34,668
You can't tease me
with the big head

1452
00:54:34,669 --> 00:54:36,003
And then not give me
any evidence.

1453
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:37,071
You call your mom right now,

1454
00:54:37,072 --> 00:54:38,605
And you tell her
to send pictures down.

1455
00:54:38,606 --> 00:54:43,977
I need evidence
of big head stat.

1456
00:54:43,978 --> 00:54:46,580
- Okay, so, uh...

1457
00:54:46,581 --> 00:54:48,849
this is one of those things
where I'm going to say something

1458
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,451
And you're going to feel
like an asshole,

1459
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:54,221
But don't feel like an asshole,
okay?

1460
00:54:54,222 --> 00:54:56,290
- Okay.

1461
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:58,959
No promises.

1462
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,764
- My mom's dead.

1463
00:55:03,765 --> 00:55:05,299
- I am an asshole.

1464
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,300
- No, you're not.

1465
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:07,501
Well, you know,
it was cancer.

1466
00:55:07,502 --> 00:55:08,502
I was 14.

1467
00:55:08,503 --> 00:55:09,503
- Listen, I am so sorry.

1468
00:55:09,504 --> 00:55:10,704
- No, that's okay.

1469
00:55:10,705 --> 00:55:12,606
I've had a lot of time
to get used to it.

1470
00:55:12,607 --> 00:55:16,277
It's fine.

1471
00:55:16,278 --> 00:55:18,479
- Wait, so your dad
raised you?

1472
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,813
- No, no.

1473
00:55:19,814 --> 00:55:22,383
My dad was a son of a bitch.

1474
00:55:22,384 --> 00:55:23,650
He didn't raise anybody.

1475
00:55:23,651 --> 00:55:26,887
He just sort of sat around
on the couch drinking

1476
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:30,191
And cashing unemployment checks.

1477
00:55:30,192 --> 00:55:34,695
No, so Walt and I pretty much
raised ourselves.

1478
00:55:34,696 --> 00:55:36,130
- Huh.

1479
00:55:36,131 --> 00:55:38,065
- Yeah, weird, huh?

1480
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:44,004
So what, is that the,

1481
00:55:44,005 --> 00:55:47,541
"Huh, now I know
why she's so screwed up?

1482
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:50,578
"Deadbeat dad,
dead mother.

1483
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:53,114
It explains why
she's such a nut."

1484
00:55:53,115 --> 00:55:54,515
- No.

1485
00:55:54,516 --> 00:55:57,084
That's the, "huh, I'm wondering
why my best friend

1486
00:55:57,085 --> 00:56:00,421
Never told me
any of this stuff."

1487
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:05,826
- Well, you know, we don't
really talk about it that much.

1488
00:56:05,827 --> 00:56:09,463
- Well, just for the record,

1489
00:56:09,464 --> 00:56:14,435
You're really not that
screwed up, like, at all.

1490
00:56:14,436 --> 00:56:18,038
Sorry.

1491
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:22,343
- Well, maybe you're not seeing
that clearly.

1492
00:56:22,344 --> 00:56:24,278
- Maybe.

1493
00:56:29,618 --> 00:56:32,453
- You know, I could draw
a picture of the big head.

1494
00:56:32,454 --> 00:56:34,121
Probably wouldn't
do it justice, though.

1495
00:56:34,122 --> 00:56:35,523
- No, a drawing,
that's good.

1496
00:56:35,524 --> 00:56:37,358
Yeah, have that on my desk
by the morning.

1497
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,293
- Okay.

1498
00:57:04,018 --> 00:57:05,052
- I feel it is my duty

1499
00:57:05,053 --> 00:57:07,488
To inform you
that it is not raining.

1500
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:09,356
- I did take note of that.

1501
00:57:09,357 --> 00:57:10,357
- I thought you might.

1502
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:11,792
You are a professional,
after--

1503
00:57:11,793 --> 00:57:12,793
You were a professional.

1504
00:57:12,794 --> 00:57:13,827
- No, I still am.

1505
00:57:13,828 --> 00:57:15,196
- Sylvia?

1506
00:57:15,197 --> 00:57:16,863
- Shit.

1507
00:57:16,864 --> 00:57:19,132
Hey, guy--
Hey, you guys.

1508
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:20,301
- Hi.

1509
00:57:20,302 --> 00:57:22,336
- What are you doing
on this side of town?

1510
00:57:22,337 --> 00:57:23,837
- Oh, having dinner.

1511
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:28,475
So who's your friend?

1512
00:57:28,476 --> 00:57:29,476
- Byron.
- I know.

1513
00:57:29,477 --> 00:57:30,811
- I'm Byron.

1514
00:57:30,812 --> 00:57:34,014
- Yes, uh, these are my friends
Emily and Jane.

1515
00:57:34,015 --> 00:57:35,649
- Hi, Emily and Jane.

1516
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:36,717
- Hi.
- Hi.

1517
00:57:36,718 --> 00:57:37,818
- Nice to meet you, Byron.

1518
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:39,320
- Nice to meet you.

1519
00:57:39,321 --> 00:57:41,488
- So are you who Sylvia's been
spending all her time with?

1520
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:43,257
- She's practically
fallen off this planet.

1521
00:57:43,258 --> 00:57:44,558
- Yeah.
- I've been working a lot.

1522
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,827
- Oh, yeah,
how's the restaurant?

1523
00:57:46,828 --> 00:57:48,696
- Uh...

1524
00:57:48,697 --> 00:57:49,697
it's fine, you know.

1525
00:57:49,698 --> 00:57:50,864
It's fine.

1526
00:57:50,865 --> 00:57:53,734
- Do you work at the restaurant
too, Byron?

1527
00:57:53,735 --> 00:57:55,068
- No, no.

1528
00:57:55,069 --> 00:57:58,205
- No, he's a friend of Walt's.

1529
00:57:58,206 --> 00:57:59,206
- Walt.

1530
00:57:59,207 --> 00:58:01,174
- Walt, my-my brother, Walt.

1531
00:58:01,175 --> 00:58:02,175
- Her brother.

1532
00:58:02,176 --> 00:58:03,277
- Oh, oh, right, of course.

1533
00:58:03,278 --> 00:58:05,212
Sorry. Walt.

1534
00:58:05,213 --> 00:58:07,147
- So how old are you, Byron?

1535
00:58:07,148 --> 00:58:08,549
- Emily.

1536
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:10,016
- Is that a weird question?

1537
00:58:10,017 --> 00:58:11,118
- 25?

1538
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:12,953
- Or, like, 24?

1539
00:58:12,954 --> 00:58:14,020
- 23?

1540
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:16,357
- 29.

1541
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:17,358
It's actually--

1542
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,293
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1543
00:58:19,294 --> 00:58:20,294
- Great, higher than--

1544
00:58:20,295 --> 00:58:21,328
- Older than--right.

1545
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:22,596
- We were saying.

1546
00:58:22,597 --> 00:58:23,597
- Yeah.

1547
00:58:23,598 --> 00:58:26,500
I'm not that young,
I guess.

1548
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:29,102
- We thought you were...

1549
00:58:29,103 --> 00:58:30,738
- well, this is kind of
awkward.

1550
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:32,306
- Oh, no, my gosh.
- What?

1551
00:58:32,307 --> 00:58:33,507
- No, mm-mm.
- I don't think--

1552
00:58:33,508 --> 00:58:34,541
- No, I'm okay.

1553
00:58:34,542 --> 00:58:36,510
- Just me, I guess.

1554
00:58:39,748 --> 00:58:41,415
- All right, well,
it was great seeing you.

1555
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:42,416
- Oh, so good.

1556
00:58:42,417 --> 00:58:43,617
- It was good.

1557
00:58:43,618 --> 00:58:47,821
I'm glad that we
ran into you here of all places.

1558
00:58:47,822 --> 00:58:49,657
- So okay, it was great.

1559
00:58:49,658 --> 00:58:50,658
W-What are you doing?

1560
00:58:50,659 --> 00:58:52,025
- Nothing.

1561
00:58:52,026 --> 00:58:54,161
- Okay, well, it certainly
looks like something to me.

1562
00:58:54,162 --> 00:58:56,129
- All right.

1563
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:57,130
- Okay, great.

1564
00:58:57,131 --> 00:58:58,399
- Okay, we'll see you guys soon.

1565
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,400
- Yeah.
- Okay, bye.

1566
00:58:59,401 --> 00:59:00,401
- Bye-Bye, Byron.

1567
00:59:00,402 --> 00:59:01,568
Oh, God, that sounds silly.

1568
00:59:01,569 --> 00:59:02,603
"Bye-bye, Byron."

1569
00:59:02,604 --> 00:59:03,604
Oh, it's funny, right?

1570
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:04,605
- Yeah, it does.

1571
00:59:04,606 --> 00:59:05,606
Okay, walk away now.

1572
00:59:05,607 --> 00:59:06,607
- Oh, yeah, okay.
Bye.

1573
00:59:06,608 --> 00:59:07,608
- Bye-Bye.

1574
00:59:07,609 --> 00:59:09,543
- Bye.

1575
00:59:12,146 --> 00:59:15,449
So those were my friends.

1576
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:19,085
- Yeah, that sucks.

1577
00:59:26,494 --> 00:59:29,596
And it's raining.

1578
00:59:29,597 --> 00:59:31,598
- Yeah.

1579
00:59:35,169 --> 00:59:38,138
- So, Sylvia,

1580
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:40,140
How's it going?

1581
00:59:40,141 --> 00:59:43,243
- I am living the dream, irving.

1582
00:59:43,244 --> 00:59:47,581
- Yeah, so we've worked together
for quite a while now.

1583
00:59:47,582 --> 00:59:51,051
- Five fun-filled weeks.

1584
00:59:51,052 --> 00:59:55,856
- I think it's time we stop
playing these little games.

1585
00:59:55,857 --> 00:59:58,392
- What games are we playing,
irving?

1586
00:59:58,393 --> 01:00:01,262
- The one where you pretend
you're not into me.

1587
01:00:01,263 --> 01:00:05,999
I pretend not to notice
your lust-filled gazes.

1588
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,368
- Oh.

1589
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:12,739
- I mean, we're both, you know,
mature, sexual beings.

1590
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,543
I say it's time we stop
torturing ourselves

1591
01:00:15,544 --> 01:00:20,113
And you know, give into
our animal nature.

1592
01:00:20,114 --> 01:00:22,683
- Yeah, I'm on my break,
irving.

1593
01:00:22,684 --> 01:00:24,285
- I mean, sure, you're--

1594
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:26,820
You're a little bit older
than anybody else here,

1595
01:00:26,821 --> 01:00:28,789
But you know,
I'm cool with that.

1596
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:30,123
I'm down with that.

1597
01:00:30,124 --> 01:00:31,225
I mean, you could--

1598
01:00:32,727 --> 01:00:35,796
- You could probably teach me
some shit.

1599
01:00:35,797 --> 01:00:38,799
- God, I am on my break.

1600
01:00:40,968 --> 01:00:42,769
- Okay, here we go.
Come on.

1601
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:44,171
It's okay.
Here we go.

1602
01:00:44,172 --> 01:00:46,607
- The guy is choking.
Oh, my God.

1603
01:00:47,609 --> 01:00:49,443
- There you go.

1604
01:00:49,444 --> 01:00:50,544
Oh!

1605
01:00:50,545 --> 01:00:53,180
Sorry.

1606
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,520
- Here it is.

1607
01:00:59,521 --> 01:01:01,488
"Sassy weather girl
saves the day."

1608
01:01:01,489 --> 01:01:02,489
- Move it.

1609
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:03,890
- I really hate
that "Sassy" thing.

1610
01:01:03,891 --> 01:01:05,359
- Look, you're sassy.
Just accept it.

1611
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,360
- So sassy.

1612
01:01:06,361 --> 01:01:07,428
- Wait, do I look fat in that?

1613
01:01:07,429 --> 01:01:08,462
I think I look fat in that.

1614
01:01:08,463 --> 01:01:09,763
- No, you look great.
Look at you.

1615
01:01:09,764 --> 01:01:10,764
- Hello, yeah.

1616
01:01:10,765 --> 01:01:14,401
Hey, fat girl.

1617
01:01:14,402 --> 01:01:15,969
Go back to that part
where she drops him.

1618
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:18,405
That's my favorite.

1619
01:01:18,406 --> 01:01:21,108
- Um, what?
At the end?

1620
01:01:21,109 --> 01:01:22,876
- Shit.

1621
01:01:22,877 --> 01:01:24,278
- What?
- I knew it.

1622
01:01:24,279 --> 01:01:25,279
You like her.

1623
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,280
You like her.

1624
01:01:26,281 --> 01:01:27,481
I knew this was going to happen.

1625
01:01:27,482 --> 01:01:28,482
- Come on, man, I told you.

1626
01:01:28,483 --> 01:01:29,483
I don't like her.

1627
01:01:29,484 --> 01:01:31,051
This is a casual thing.

1628
01:01:31,052 --> 01:01:32,052
- Whatever, man.

1629
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:33,053
You gonna tell her?

1630
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:34,755
- Tell her what?

1631
01:01:34,756 --> 01:01:35,956
- Look, you better tell her,

1632
01:01:35,957 --> 01:01:37,358
'Cause she's rolled up
the window.

1633
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,359
- The window?

1634
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,660
What are you even
talking about?

1635
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:40,961
- The window is up.

1636
01:01:40,962 --> 01:01:42,296
And you're on that side of it.

1637
01:01:42,297 --> 01:01:43,364
Look, I know her, man.

1638
01:01:43,365 --> 01:01:44,798
You can't break through
the window.

1639
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:45,799
That shit's bulletproof.

1640
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,134
She has to roll it down.

1641
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,469
The only way
she's going to do that

1642
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,404
Is if you tell her
you dig her.

1643
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:55,108
- Bulletproof, huh?

1644
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:57,177
- Of course, the problem is,
if you tell her you dig her

1645
01:01:57,178 --> 01:01:58,879
And she doesn't want to roll
down the window,

1646
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,880
She'll cut off the sex.

1647
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:01,081
Having a casual relationship

1648
01:02:01,082 --> 01:02:02,849
With someone who has emotions
is messy, man.

1649
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:04,251
- Stop, all right?
I don't like her.

1650
01:02:04,252 --> 01:02:05,819
I don't want her to roll down
her window.

1651
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,988
I don't even want to get into
her metaphorical car, okay?

1652
01:02:07,989 --> 01:02:09,757
Leave it alone.

1653
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:11,358
- Yeah, that's it, good.

1654
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,493
That's good.

1655
01:02:12,494 --> 01:02:14,161
Throw a little fit there.
Good for you.

1656
01:02:14,162 --> 01:02:15,996
You know that's exactly what
she wants to avoid

1657
01:02:15,997 --> 01:02:17,698
By rolling up the window
in the first place.

1658
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:18,766
Way to fall into her trap.

1659
01:02:18,767 --> 01:02:19,767
- You--

1660
01:02:22,203 --> 01:02:26,106
- What?
What's the matter?

1661
01:02:26,107 --> 01:02:27,374
- First off, Sylvia,

1662
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:29,376
I just want to thank you
for coming in this morning.

1663
01:02:29,377 --> 01:02:31,812
I know it must be a bit awkward.

1664
01:02:31,813 --> 01:02:34,114
- Well, yeah, but, uh,
couldn't stay away, you know?

1665
01:02:34,115 --> 01:02:35,449
Curiosity and all that.

1666
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:36,617
- Right, right, right, right.

1667
01:02:36,618 --> 01:02:38,619
So let's get down
to brass tacks.

1668
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,755
We have rerun your last show
four times

1669
01:02:41,756 --> 01:02:43,089
In the six weeks
you've been gone.

1670
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,359
And the ratings have
gotten better every time.

1671
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,627
It is all over the internet

1672
01:02:46,628 --> 01:02:49,296
And so is that video of you,
by the way,

1673
01:02:49,297 --> 01:02:50,497
Saving the man from choking.

1674
01:02:50,498 --> 01:02:54,702
Everybody seems to know
the sassy weather girl.

1675
01:02:54,703 --> 01:02:56,169
- God, you've got to be
kidding me.

1676
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:58,639
- No, no, no, we get letters,
phone calls applauding you,

1677
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,807
And--Hey, Josh!

1678
01:02:59,808 --> 01:03:01,642
Shut that off.

1679
01:03:01,643 --> 01:03:04,645
Our viewers love you
more than ever before.

1680
01:03:04,646 --> 01:03:07,147
They say you've got verve.

1681
01:03:07,148 --> 01:03:08,382
Let me hear you say it.

1682
01:03:08,383 --> 01:03:09,383
- Verve.

1683
01:03:09,384 --> 01:03:10,551
- Say it louder.
- Ver--Okay.

1684
01:03:10,552 --> 01:03:11,618
- That's what you got, babe.

1685
01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:12,919
And that's what
they want to see.

1686
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,155
Well, and we're
going into sweeps.

1687
01:03:15,156 --> 01:03:16,189
- So what?

1688
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:18,024
You want me to come back
to my old job?

1689
01:03:18,025 --> 01:03:19,259
- No, no,
not your old job.

1690
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,161
No, your old job,
you popped in every 15 minutes.

1691
01:03:21,162 --> 01:03:26,066
No, mmm, we want you
to coanchor.

1692
01:03:26,067 --> 01:03:27,100
- Coanchor?

1693
01:03:27,101 --> 01:03:28,134
- You and Dale.

1694
01:03:28,135 --> 01:03:29,302
- Oh, no, no.
I can't--

1695
01:03:29,303 --> 01:03:30,337
- Yes, yes, come.

1696
01:03:30,338 --> 01:03:31,338
Yes, yes, no, see?

1697
01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:34,475
That's--That's the hook, babe.

1698
01:03:34,476 --> 01:03:36,042
That's what everybody
wants to see:

1699
01:03:36,043 --> 01:03:38,779
You two going back and forth
going at it.

1700
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,914
And you can say
anything you want.

1701
01:03:40,915 --> 01:03:43,884
In fact, we want you to.

1702
01:03:43,885 --> 01:03:46,587
- What about the mousy bitch?

1703
01:03:46,588 --> 01:03:47,755
- Who?

1704
01:03:47,756 --> 01:03:48,756
- Mousy bitch.

1705
01:03:48,757 --> 01:03:50,957
- Mm, mm.

1706
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:51,992
That mousy bitch.

1707
01:03:51,993 --> 01:03:54,795
Well,
since she and Dale broke up,

1708
01:03:54,796 --> 01:03:58,365
She's become increasingly
difficult.

1709
01:03:58,366 --> 01:04:01,268
If you ask me,
between you and me,

1710
01:04:01,269 --> 01:04:03,404
I think the heifer's drinking.

1711
01:04:03,405 --> 01:04:05,305
- Really?
- Mm.

1712
01:04:05,306 --> 01:04:06,306
Really.

1713
01:04:06,307 --> 01:04:07,775
- Huh.

1714
01:04:11,813 --> 01:04:13,480
- Are you coming back?

1715
01:04:13,481 --> 01:04:15,816
- Does that idea scare you?

1716
01:04:15,817 --> 01:04:19,286
- No, actually,
I suggested it.

1717
01:04:19,287 --> 01:04:21,254
- Really?

1718
01:04:21,255 --> 01:04:24,558
- Yeah, yeah, I miss you.

1719
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,828
I know it sounds corny,
but I do.

1720
01:04:27,829 --> 01:04:29,797
- Well, I haven't given fitz
my answer yet,

1721
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:33,400
But somehow it doesn't seem
like the best idea ever.

1722
01:04:33,401 --> 01:04:36,336
- Well, maybe we could
get together.

1723
01:04:36,337 --> 01:04:38,371
We could talk.

1724
01:04:38,372 --> 01:04:40,340
Maybe we could have dinner.

1725
01:04:40,341 --> 01:04:45,813
Maybe I could calm some fears.

1726
01:04:45,814 --> 01:04:47,380
- Are you asking me
on a date?

1727
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:48,381
- If you want it to be.

1728
01:04:48,382 --> 01:04:51,852
If not,
a dinner between colleagues,

1729
01:04:51,853 --> 01:04:55,456
A business dinner.

1730
01:04:55,457 --> 01:04:57,558
- Dale?

1731
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:00,561
Daley?

1732
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:04,932
Oh, oh, lookee here.

1733
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:08,134
Two lovebirds
reu-Fucking-Nited.

1734
01:05:08,135 --> 01:05:12,639
- Sherry,
go back in your dressing room.

1735
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,941
- Oh, sorry,
first you dump me,

1736
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:16,677
And now you think
you can tell me what to do?

1737
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:18,712
Well, I got news for you,
asshole.

1738
01:05:18,713 --> 01:05:20,481
You're not the boss of me.

1739
01:05:20,482 --> 01:05:24,952
I'm going to what I want to do
and when I want it.

1740
01:05:24,953 --> 01:05:26,219
Hi, Sylvia.

1741
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,821
- Hey, Sherry.

1742
01:05:27,822 --> 01:05:30,290
- I guess you think
this is karma, huh?

1743
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:31,725
- No, I didn't--
I didn't think that.

1744
01:05:31,726 --> 01:05:33,660
- The mousy bitch gets hers
in the end, am I right?

1745
01:05:33,661 --> 01:05:34,661
"Oh, no."

1746
01:05:34,662 --> 01:05:37,731
Makes perfect sense to me.

1747
01:05:37,732 --> 01:05:40,100
Hey, Dale, you want to see
my impression of Sylvia?

1748
01:05:40,101 --> 01:05:41,535
"Hi, I'm Sylvia.

1749
01:05:41,536 --> 01:05:45,338
"I have a psychotic episode
on live television.

1750
01:05:45,339 --> 01:05:47,007
"I used some terrible,
foul language,

1751
01:05:47,008 --> 01:05:51,578
"And I described a sex act
on a morning tv show.

1752
01:05:51,579 --> 01:05:53,647
"I'm very, very mean
to stupid Sherry,

1753
01:05:53,648 --> 01:05:55,148
"And I call her
really hurtful names

1754
01:05:55,149 --> 01:05:57,751
"That just might remind her
of some stuff from childhood,

1755
01:05:57,752 --> 01:05:59,820
"And then when sweeps
comes around,

1756
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:00,988
I take her job."

1757
01:06:00,989 --> 01:06:02,756
Oh, and this is my favorite one.

1758
01:06:02,757 --> 01:06:06,026
"The man I emasculated in front
of millions of Seattleites

1759
01:06:06,027 --> 01:06:09,129
Starts wanting me back."

1760
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,764
How the fuck does that happen?

1761
01:06:10,765 --> 01:06:13,734
I mean, that doesn't
make any sense.

1762
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:15,903
Unless I'm being punished
by a God.

1763
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:19,406
Oh, you guys think
God's mad at me?

1764
01:06:19,407 --> 01:06:20,574
- No, I doubt it.

1765
01:06:20,575 --> 01:06:22,142
- Oh, shut up!

1766
01:06:22,143 --> 01:06:25,946
Bullshit!
You don't know!

1767
01:06:28,215 --> 01:06:30,617
So you guys are getting
back together, huh?

1768
01:06:30,618 --> 01:06:31,919
That's...

1769
01:06:36,991 --> 01:06:38,559
My face hurts.

1770
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,326
- We'll take care of you, ma'am.

1771
01:06:40,327 --> 01:06:41,394
- I love you.

1772
01:06:41,395 --> 01:06:42,563
Can you grab
my water bottle?

1773
01:06:42,564 --> 01:06:43,564
- No, ma'am.

1774
01:06:43,565 --> 01:06:44,898
- But it's right there.

1775
01:06:44,899 --> 01:06:45,899
- No.

1776
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,167
- W-W-Why?

1777
01:06:47,168 --> 01:06:49,636
But it's important for me
to stay hydrated.

1778
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:51,404
- Well, I would just like
to congratulate you

1779
01:06:51,405 --> 01:06:52,573
On another dramatic ending

1780
01:06:52,574 --> 01:06:53,974
To another romantic
relationship.

1781
01:06:53,975 --> 01:06:54,975
- Who's your manager?

1782
01:06:54,976 --> 01:06:55,976
- Well, at least this time

1783
01:06:55,977 --> 01:06:56,977
She didn't want to kill me.

1784
01:06:56,978 --> 01:06:58,211
She wanted to kill you.

1785
01:06:58,212 --> 01:06:59,279
- Details.

1786
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,513
- I need it!

1787
01:07:00,514 --> 01:07:04,718
- You never responded
to my dinner invitation.

1788
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:05,652
- You're doing what?

1789
01:07:05,653 --> 01:07:06,720
- Stop saying that.

1790
01:07:06,721 --> 01:07:08,054
- I'm sorry.

1791
01:07:08,055 --> 01:07:09,956
I'm just having a hard time
with the logic here.

1792
01:07:09,957 --> 01:07:12,058
- They are offering me a raise,
and I get to coanchor.

1793
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:13,260
You know what that means, Walt?

1794
01:07:13,261 --> 01:07:15,061
It means I get to deliver
the news.

1795
01:07:15,062 --> 01:07:17,130
Real news, not just the weather.

1796
01:07:17,131 --> 01:07:18,965
I mean, you know,
I still have to do the weather,

1797
01:07:18,966 --> 01:07:20,300
But I get
to do other stuff too now.

1798
01:07:20,301 --> 01:07:23,169
- All of that for the
rock-Bottom price of your soul.

1799
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:24,704
- Would you stop being
so dramatic?

1800
01:07:24,705 --> 01:07:26,139
- Will you stop being
such a sellout?

1801
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:27,140
- Walt.

1802
01:07:27,141 --> 01:07:29,242
- Sylvia, they fired you
with prejudice.

1803
01:07:29,243 --> 01:07:30,343
- They did not fire me.

1804
01:07:30,344 --> 01:07:31,511
I quit.
- Oh.

1805
01:07:31,512 --> 01:07:32,712
- Look, this is a real job,

1806
01:07:32,713 --> 01:07:33,880
One where I never have to touch

1807
01:07:33,881 --> 01:07:35,715
Dirty dishes or leftover food
again.

1808
01:07:35,716 --> 01:07:37,684
And if I take it,
there's a signing bonus,

1809
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:39,619
Which means I get to find
my own place immediately

1810
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,220
And pay you back
all the money I owe you.

1811
01:07:41,221 --> 01:07:42,522
- I don't want your dirty money.

1812
01:07:42,523 --> 01:07:44,991
I want you to have some
goddamn self-respect.

1813
01:07:44,992 --> 01:07:47,193
- God, you are so
self-important.

1814
01:07:47,194 --> 01:07:48,762
- Think about what you're doing.

1815
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:50,463
- I want a life, Walt, okay?

1816
01:07:50,464 --> 01:07:51,898
I am a 35-Year-Old woman,

1817
01:07:51,899 --> 01:07:54,066
And I'm living
like a college freshman.

1818
01:07:54,067 --> 01:07:55,067
I have no money.

1819
01:07:55,068 --> 01:07:56,068
I am waiting tables.

1820
01:07:56,069 --> 01:07:57,236
I have a roommate.

1821
01:07:57,237 --> 01:07:59,539
And I am sleeping with
the guy across the hall.

1822
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:01,374
Don't you talk to me
about self-respect, Walt.

1823
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:03,109
I'm doing this
because I deserve better.

1824
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:04,577
- Oh, is that why
you're going on a date

1825
01:08:04,578 --> 01:08:06,879
With the guy who cheated on you
and broke your heart?

1826
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,980
- It is not a date.

1827
01:08:07,981 --> 01:08:09,582
It is a business dinner
with a colleague.

1828
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:10,583
- Shut up!

1829
01:08:10,584 --> 01:08:11,785
- And I think "Broke your heart"

1830
01:08:11,786 --> 01:08:13,320
Is overdoing it a bit,
don't you think?

1831
01:08:13,321 --> 01:08:14,754
- You know what?

1832
01:08:14,755 --> 01:08:16,656
I'm just going to say this,
and then I'm walking.

1833
01:08:16,657 --> 01:08:17,657
- Oh, I highly doubt that.

1834
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:18,692
- Oh, I'm walking

1835
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:20,092
Just as soon as I say
this one thing.

1836
01:08:20,093 --> 01:08:21,093
You ready?
- What?

1837
01:08:21,094 --> 01:08:24,096
- You ready?
- What?

1838
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:26,499
- Mom would be really
disappointed in you.

1839
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,134
That's right.

1840
01:08:28,135 --> 01:08:31,604
I invoked mom.

1841
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:33,707
- Mom would be really
disappointed in me?

1842
01:08:33,708 --> 01:08:34,808
Is that what you said?

1843
01:08:34,809 --> 01:08:37,344
- Yeah, that's what I said.

1844
01:08:37,345 --> 01:08:39,212
- Oh.

1845
01:08:39,213 --> 01:08:41,080
Well, that's interesting, Walt,

1846
01:08:41,081 --> 01:08:43,350
Considering
that mom worked

1847
01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:45,251
Until she could barely stand up
from the pain

1848
01:08:45,252 --> 01:08:46,820
While our father
sat on the couch all day

1849
01:08:46,821 --> 01:08:48,254
Doing nothing
but pass judgments.

1850
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,255
Wait a minute.

1851
01:08:49,256 --> 01:08:50,256
Who else does that, Walt?

1852
01:08:50,257 --> 01:08:51,524
Let me think--Uh-oh.

1853
01:08:51,525 --> 01:08:53,326
You know who else does that?
You do that, Walt.

1854
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:55,362
So while I may be a huge
disappointment to our mother,

1855
01:08:55,363 --> 01:08:56,396
I take solace in the fact

1856
01:08:56,397 --> 01:08:58,231
That wherever
that son of a bitch is,

1857
01:08:58,232 --> 01:08:59,399
He is probably really proud

1858
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,168
Of the fine young man
you've become.

1859
01:09:05,639 --> 01:09:07,474
Okay.

1860
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:09,642
Okay.

1861
01:09:09,643 --> 01:09:13,079
You do whatever you want to do,
Sylvia.

1862
01:09:18,552 --> 01:09:19,819
- Shit.

1863
01:09:28,629 --> 01:09:29,629
- Hey.

1864
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:32,465
- Hey.

1865
01:09:32,466 --> 01:09:35,167
- I just talked to Walt.

1866
01:09:35,168 --> 01:09:37,771
Are you okay?

1867
01:09:37,772 --> 01:09:39,138
- Yeah.
No, I'm fine, thanks.

1868
01:09:39,139 --> 01:09:41,307
It's just, you know.

1869
01:09:41,308 --> 01:09:43,510
You know me and Walt.
We're always bickering.

1870
01:09:43,511 --> 01:09:47,346
- Yeah, that didn't sound
like bickering.

1871
01:09:50,484 --> 01:09:53,720
- Um, well,
I'm kind of running late, so...

1872
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:57,056
- right, so you're going back
to the morning show?

1873
01:09:57,057 --> 01:09:58,925
- Considering it.

1874
01:09:58,926 --> 01:10:01,027
- And the guy?

1875
01:10:01,028 --> 01:10:02,995
You're, uh, you're gonna
go out with him?

1876
01:10:02,996 --> 01:10:05,064
- Mm-Hmm.

1877
01:10:05,065 --> 01:10:06,466
- The haircut?

1878
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:09,436
- Yeah, I--Can we talk about
this later, please?

1879
01:10:09,437 --> 01:10:11,704
- Yeah, well, you will have
already gone out with him later,

1880
01:10:11,705 --> 01:10:14,273
So that talk will be moot.

1881
01:10:14,274 --> 01:10:16,910
- Byron, don't act like this,
okay?

1882
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:17,911
- Act like this?

1883
01:10:17,912 --> 01:10:19,679
Act like what?

1884
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,380
I'm not acting.
You're acting.

1885
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:22,816
I'm just reacting here.

1886
01:10:22,817 --> 01:10:24,751
- We had a deal,
remember?

1887
01:10:24,752 --> 01:10:27,019
We--No emotions.

1888
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,555
No commitment, right?

1889
01:10:28,556 --> 01:10:31,157
We're just--
We've been having fun.

1890
01:10:31,158 --> 01:10:33,259
- Yeah, I remember the deal.

1891
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:34,961
You don't have to tell me
what the deal is

1892
01:10:34,962 --> 01:10:38,631
'Cause I remember it, so...

1893
01:10:38,632 --> 01:10:40,567
- so what's the problem?

1894
01:10:44,638 --> 01:10:47,674
- It's not a problem.

1895
01:10:49,209 --> 01:10:50,309
The problem is that

1896
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:52,712
That deal was made,
like, forever ago.

1897
01:10:52,713 --> 01:10:54,113
Right?

1898
01:10:54,114 --> 01:10:56,616
I mean, this was before
we knew each other

1899
01:10:56,617 --> 01:10:58,317
And before we spent
all this time together,

1900
01:10:58,318 --> 01:11:00,954
And--And--And we liked
each other, and we had fun,

1901
01:11:00,955 --> 01:11:02,121
And--And it was before

1902
01:11:02,122 --> 01:11:05,492
I picked you that stupid flower
off the table.

1903
01:11:05,493 --> 01:11:08,828
Hey, hey.

1904
01:11:08,829 --> 01:11:10,763
We have a good thing here.

1905
01:11:14,635 --> 01:11:17,670
I like you.

1906
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:21,374
I don't want you
to see anybody else.

1907
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:28,648
I just--I thought that we had
kind of moved past the deal.

1908
01:11:33,487 --> 01:11:36,756
- Well, um...

1909
01:11:36,757 --> 01:11:40,693
I haven't felt that--
I haven't felt that way.

1910
01:11:45,298 --> 01:11:47,800
- Oh, uh, well...

1911
01:11:47,801 --> 01:11:49,268
that's different.

1912
01:11:49,269 --> 01:11:51,070
- Look, Byron, listen, I...

1913
01:11:51,071 --> 01:11:55,241
- no, um,
I was mistaken.

1914
01:11:56,644 --> 01:12:00,212
Um, God, I just--

1915
01:12:00,213 --> 01:12:02,949
I feel so not cool
right now.

1916
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:04,851
I should go.

1917
01:12:04,852 --> 01:12:05,852
- Listen to me.

1918
01:12:05,853 --> 01:12:09,088
Byron, I--Look,
I like you a lot.

1919
01:12:09,089 --> 01:12:11,691
I do.
I just--

1920
01:12:11,692 --> 01:12:13,426
We're too different,
you know?

1921
01:12:13,427 --> 01:12:18,330
And I need to be
with a grown-Up.

1922
01:12:18,331 --> 01:12:19,966
- Right.

1923
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:23,636
Somebody not me.

1924
01:12:23,637 --> 01:12:28,207
That's okay.

1925
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:31,711
But I think that
we should stop talking now.

1926
01:12:31,712 --> 01:12:33,646
Good luck on your date, though.

1927
01:12:42,556 --> 01:12:43,556
- Sylvia?

1928
01:12:43,557 --> 01:12:45,658
- Yeah?

1929
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:47,426
- Oh, God, hi, sorry.

1930
01:12:47,427 --> 01:12:49,495
Yes, please.

1931
01:12:51,966 --> 01:12:55,267
Thank you.

1932
01:12:57,370 --> 01:13:01,140
- Where are you?

1933
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:02,241
- I'm here.

1934
01:13:02,242 --> 01:13:04,010
I just, you know,
I have a lot on my mind.

1935
01:13:04,011 --> 01:13:05,578
That's all.

1936
01:13:05,579 --> 01:13:07,080
- Yeah, I'll bet.

1937
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:08,247
I'll bet you're overwhelmed.

1938
01:13:08,248 --> 01:13:10,483
I know certainly am.

1939
01:13:10,484 --> 01:13:11,985
- Is that right?

1940
01:13:11,986 --> 01:13:16,723
- Feel like I've been given
a second chance at happiness.

1941
01:13:16,724 --> 01:13:19,291
- Wow, forgive me
if I don't swoon.

1942
01:13:21,061 --> 01:13:22,862
I'm serious.

1943
01:13:22,863 --> 01:13:23,963
I'm very serious.

1944
01:13:23,964 --> 01:13:28,735
Sherry--
Sherry taught me something.

1945
01:13:28,736 --> 01:13:32,271
She brought perspective.

1946
01:13:32,272 --> 01:13:36,408
Sherry's, um,
she's just a girl.

1947
01:13:36,409 --> 01:13:39,578
You're a woman.

1948
01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:44,483
And you're the one for me.

1949
01:13:44,484 --> 01:13:46,085
- Well, I'm glad dating

1950
01:13:46,086 --> 01:13:49,488
A psychotic, obsessive,
self-loathing alcoholic

1951
01:13:49,489 --> 01:13:51,390
Made you appreciate
what we had.

1952
01:13:51,391 --> 01:13:55,528
- Listen, I know this, okay?

1953
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:58,732
I'm a fool.

1954
01:13:58,733 --> 01:14:01,434
But I'm trying to make it right.

1955
01:14:13,447 --> 01:14:14,981
- Wait, no.

1956
01:14:14,982 --> 01:14:17,183
Oh, God, what am I doing?

1957
01:14:22,456 --> 01:14:25,658
- You're right.

1958
01:14:25,659 --> 01:14:26,659
You're right.

1959
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:29,562
Let's take it slow.

1960
01:14:29,563 --> 01:14:32,732
I'll be here
when you're ready.

1961
01:14:34,334 --> 01:14:38,538
I'm not going to screw it up
this time.

1962
01:14:59,993 --> 01:15:01,260
- She took the job.

1963
01:15:01,261 --> 01:15:04,163
Got a big bonus.
New apartment.

1964
01:15:07,635 --> 01:15:09,268
- Okay.

1965
01:15:23,884 --> 01:15:25,819
- Sorry, man.

1966
01:17:04,518 --> 01:17:06,553
- Finally got paid.

1967
01:17:06,554 --> 01:17:08,721
- Yeah?

1968
01:17:08,722 --> 01:17:12,291
Oh, this is too much.

1969
01:17:12,292 --> 01:17:15,494
- No, it's right.

1970
01:17:15,495 --> 01:17:18,665
- Shit, cool.

1971
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:23,002
You okay?

1972
01:17:24,004 --> 01:17:25,371
I'm kind of hooked on her, man.

1973
01:17:25,372 --> 01:17:27,506
- Yeah, I know.

1974
01:17:27,507 --> 01:17:28,708
- I just don't get it.

1975
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:31,878
I mean, this has never
happened to me before.

1976
01:17:31,879 --> 01:17:37,183
Girls usually like me.

1977
01:17:37,184 --> 01:17:41,120
- So what are you gonna do
about it?

1978
01:17:41,121 --> 01:17:46,893
- Well, I've started drinking
heavily.

1979
01:17:46,894 --> 01:17:47,894
What, man?

1980
01:17:47,895 --> 01:17:49,963
What do you want me to do?

1981
01:17:49,964 --> 01:17:53,199
Am I supposed to go out
and run out into the rain

1982
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,868
And declare my undying love
and devotion?

1983
01:17:55,869 --> 01:17:57,904
Yeah, why don't I make it
just a little more awkward?

1984
01:17:57,905 --> 01:17:58,905
You know what?

1985
01:17:58,906 --> 01:17:59,939
She knows.

1986
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:01,207
What am I supposed to say?

1987
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:03,076
You know, "Hey, Sylvia, um,

1988
01:18:03,077 --> 01:18:04,510
I'm into you."

1989
01:18:04,511 --> 01:18:05,745
And then she'll say,

1990
01:18:05,746 --> 01:18:08,081
"Um, Byron, I thought we
already talked about this.

1991
01:18:08,082 --> 01:18:09,782
I told you that
I'm not that into you."

1992
01:18:09,783 --> 01:18:11,584
And then I'll be, like,
"No, no, no, no, no,

1993
01:18:11,585 --> 01:18:12,585
"You don't get it.

1994
01:18:12,586 --> 01:18:15,454
I'm really, really into you."

1995
01:18:15,455 --> 01:18:18,725
And then she'll be, like,
"Oh, my God.

1996
01:18:18,726 --> 01:18:21,728
"I-I totally didn't even realize
what you were saying before.

1997
01:18:21,729 --> 01:18:23,896
"I was so confused,
but now, now I get it

1998
01:18:23,897 --> 01:18:25,131
"Because now that you've told me

1999
01:18:25,132 --> 01:18:26,599
"That you're really,
really into me,

2000
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,601
"Now that I have that
little piece of information,

2001
01:18:28,602 --> 01:18:29,769
"Everything changes.

2002
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:31,170
"I have all these feelings
for you,

2003
01:18:31,171 --> 01:18:32,404
"And all of a sudden,

2004
01:18:32,405 --> 01:18:36,442
I am so totally really,
really into you too, wow."

2005
01:18:36,443 --> 01:18:37,543
- Whatever.

2006
01:18:37,544 --> 01:18:38,611
- No, "Whatever" you, dude.

2007
01:18:38,612 --> 01:18:40,212
What am I supposed to do?

2008
01:18:40,213 --> 01:18:42,481
She chose the tool, okay?

2009
01:18:42,482 --> 01:18:44,884
That's what she wants.

2010
01:18:44,885 --> 01:18:45,885
You know what?

2011
01:18:45,886 --> 01:18:47,386
She wants the money
and the security

2012
01:18:47,387 --> 01:18:50,389
And the grown-Upness,

2013
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:52,358
And I don't have any of it,
all right?

2014
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:53,559
And you know that.

2015
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,227
And I wish you would stop
pushing me into it

2016
01:18:55,228 --> 01:18:57,630
Just so you could watch me
go down in flames.

2017
01:18:57,631 --> 01:18:59,032
- You know what?

2018
01:18:59,033 --> 01:19:00,566
If you don't take it
as far as you can go,

2019
01:19:00,567 --> 01:19:02,268
You don't deserve her.

2020
01:19:02,269 --> 01:19:03,936
All right?

2021
01:19:03,937 --> 01:19:06,572
Do you love her?

2022
01:19:06,573 --> 01:19:08,107
- What difference
does that make, man?

2023
01:19:08,108 --> 01:19:09,175
- Do you love her?

2024
01:19:09,176 --> 01:19:10,442
Don't be a pussy,
just tell me.

2025
01:19:10,443 --> 01:19:13,512
Do you love her?

2026
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:36,235
- Knock, knock.

2027
01:19:36,236 --> 01:19:37,503
- Another flower.

2028
01:19:37,504 --> 01:19:39,371
- Oh, you look amazing.

2029
01:19:39,372 --> 01:19:40,372
- Thanks.

2030
01:19:40,373 --> 01:19:41,373
I don't feel it.

2031
01:19:41,374 --> 01:19:42,441
- Yeah, just nerves.

2032
01:19:42,442 --> 01:19:43,876
You get like this
before every show.

2033
01:19:43,877 --> 01:19:45,144
You know that,
always have.

2034
01:19:45,145 --> 01:19:46,179
- Yeah, no, I know.

2035
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:47,213
You're right.

2036
01:19:47,214 --> 01:19:48,214
- I know I'm right.

2037
01:19:48,215 --> 01:19:49,215
I'm not always right.

2038
01:19:49,216 --> 01:19:51,784
One thing I do know is you.

2039
01:19:51,785 --> 01:19:54,286
I know you.

2040
01:19:54,287 --> 01:19:57,289
I'm so glad you're back
in my life, Sylvia.

2041
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:00,927
I love you.

2042
01:20:00,928 --> 01:20:02,762
You know that.

2043
01:20:02,763 --> 01:20:05,131
- Well, isn't this cute?

2044
01:20:06,934 --> 01:20:09,301
- I'll see you out there, kid.

2045
01:20:09,302 --> 01:20:10,302
Hey, Walt.

2046
01:20:10,303 --> 01:20:12,338
- Dickhead.

2047
01:20:12,339 --> 01:20:14,306
- Nice, Walt.
Really classy.

2048
01:20:14,307 --> 01:20:16,375
- Oh, I'm supposed to be nice
to him now?

2049
01:20:16,376 --> 01:20:18,144
I mean, just 'cause you're
a complete idiot,

2050
01:20:18,145 --> 01:20:19,478
I don't know why I have to be.

2051
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:21,480
- Great, my brother's trying
to pick a fight with me

2052
01:20:21,481 --> 01:20:23,049
Moments before
I go on live television.

2053
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:25,351
- Goddamn right; your brother
dragged his ass up at 5:00 A.M.

2054
01:20:25,352 --> 01:20:27,486
So he could come tell you
what an asshole you're being.

2055
01:20:27,487 --> 01:20:28,487
- Walt, don't start.

2056
01:20:28,488 --> 01:20:29,555
- I'm started, all right?

2057
01:20:29,556 --> 01:20:31,290
What are you doing here, huh?
What?

2058
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:32,591
Why did you take this job back?

2059
01:20:32,592 --> 01:20:34,360
Why are you letting
the guy who cheated on you

2060
01:20:34,361 --> 01:20:35,361
Kiss your head?

2061
01:20:35,362 --> 01:20:36,729
- God, stop it.

2062
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:38,865
Don't even try to be the
moral authority with me, Walt.

2063
01:20:38,866 --> 01:20:39,966
I know you.
- And I know you.

2064
01:20:39,967 --> 01:20:41,400
- Sylvia, you're on
in two minutes.

2065
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:42,668
- Okay.

2066
01:20:42,669 --> 01:20:45,104
- Look, you know, if you really
wanted Dale the asshole,

2067
01:20:45,105 --> 01:20:47,006
You wouldn't be feeling
so gross about all this.

2068
01:20:47,007 --> 01:20:48,241
- God, this is my life here,
Walt.

2069
01:20:48,242 --> 01:20:49,842
- Come on.
That's why I'm here, Syl.

2070
01:20:49,843 --> 01:20:50,843
- Sylvia, I'm sorry.

2071
01:20:50,844 --> 01:20:52,211
We really need you.

2072
01:20:52,212 --> 01:20:53,212
- You know what?

2073
01:20:53,213 --> 01:20:54,647
Just mind your business,
all right?

2074
01:20:54,648 --> 01:20:56,082
Look, I love you,

2075
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:58,350
And I'm trying to stop you
from making a huge mistake here.

2076
01:20:58,351 --> 01:20:59,518
You're not this girl, okay?

2077
01:20:59,519 --> 01:21:01,120
You don't get bought off
to return to a job

2078
01:21:01,121 --> 01:21:02,488
That you never liked.

2079
01:21:02,489 --> 01:21:04,390
You don't go back with the guy
who cheated on you,

2080
01:21:04,391 --> 01:21:06,492
And you don't let the one guy
you ever really cared about

2081
01:21:06,493 --> 01:21:08,193
Get away because he's not
rich enough.

2082
01:21:08,194 --> 01:21:09,362
That's not you.

2083
01:21:09,363 --> 01:21:14,933
That's--
That's sassy weather girl.

2084
01:21:14,934 --> 01:21:19,004
I hate her,
and--And so do you.

2085
01:21:22,175 --> 01:21:26,178
And hey, I'm--

2086
01:21:26,179 --> 01:21:27,747
I'm sorry I said that thing
about mom.

2087
01:21:27,748 --> 01:21:31,049
You know, it's--
It's not true.

2088
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:32,217
- No, I know.

2089
01:21:32,218 --> 01:21:34,253
And you're not like dad
at all.

2090
01:21:34,254 --> 01:21:36,955
I don't--
It was just mean.

2091
01:21:36,956 --> 01:21:39,292
Sorry.

2092
01:21:39,293 --> 01:21:41,226
- Thanks.

2093
01:21:50,537 --> 01:21:52,271
- I got her.

2094
01:22:00,914 --> 01:22:02,481
- Okay.

2095
01:22:10,089 --> 01:22:12,491
- Cutting it a little close,
aren't we?

2096
01:22:12,492 --> 01:22:13,826
- Makeup, clear.
Get out of there.

2097
01:22:13,827 --> 01:22:14,993
Clear frame.
She's fine.

2098
01:22:14,994 --> 01:22:16,094
Come on.

2099
01:22:16,095 --> 01:22:17,396
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

2100
01:22:17,397 --> 01:22:18,464
- Rolling header.

2101
01:22:18,465 --> 01:22:20,132
- Welcome to the all-new
Seattle Morning

2102
01:22:20,133 --> 01:22:22,000
With your hosts,
Dale Waters

2103
01:22:22,001 --> 01:22:24,370
And sassy Sylvia Miller.

2104
01:22:24,371 --> 01:22:25,438
Rise and shine

2105
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:28,941
And get ready
for the sparks to fly.

2106
01:22:28,942 --> 01:22:30,676
- All cameras ready?

2107
01:22:30,677 --> 01:22:32,010
- Getting ready
to do countdown.

2108
01:22:32,011 --> 01:22:33,846
- Four, three--

2109
01:22:33,847 --> 01:22:36,449
- Remember,
don't step on me.

2110
01:22:38,184 --> 01:22:40,720
Good morning, Seattle.

2111
01:22:40,721 --> 01:22:42,788
I am so glad you tuned in today,

2112
01:22:42,789 --> 01:22:45,591
Because we have a very,
very special show.

2113
01:22:45,592 --> 01:22:47,059
Today we welcome back

2114
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:49,261
A member of
our Seattle Morning family

2115
01:22:49,262 --> 01:22:51,997
And someone very special to me.

2116
01:22:51,998 --> 01:22:53,833
And even though I'm probably
in for it,

2117
01:22:53,834 --> 01:22:58,036
We are so glad
to have you back, Sylvia.

2118
01:22:58,037 --> 01:22:59,037
Go ahead, Sylvia.

2119
01:22:59,038 --> 01:23:00,506
Come on.

2120
01:23:00,507 --> 01:23:02,174
Hit me with that
acidic tongue of yours.

2121
01:23:02,175 --> 01:23:05,711
I can take it.

2122
01:23:05,712 --> 01:23:07,012
What?

2123
01:23:07,013 --> 01:23:08,514
Cat got your tongue?

2124
01:23:10,484 --> 01:23:14,353
Boy, that's a first.

2125
01:23:14,354 --> 01:23:15,821
Okay, look,
why don't we take a break.

2126
01:23:15,822 --> 01:23:17,423
We'll go to commercial,
come right back,

2127
01:23:17,424 --> 01:23:18,657
And we'll be right here--

2128
01:23:18,658 --> 01:23:20,493
- You know, Dale, returning to
Seattle Morning

2129
01:23:20,494 --> 01:23:23,061
Is rather bittersweet.

2130
01:23:23,062 --> 01:23:24,897
- Really?

2131
01:23:24,898 --> 01:23:27,366
- Really, Dale.

2132
01:23:27,367 --> 01:23:28,467
I mean, on the one hand,

2133
01:23:28,468 --> 01:23:30,002
I get to return to
a demeaning position

2134
01:23:30,003 --> 01:23:32,405
Where my job is to giggle
and look attractive

2135
01:23:32,406 --> 01:23:34,172
And trivialize the day's news.

2136
01:23:34,173 --> 01:23:35,574
On the other hand,

2137
01:23:35,575 --> 01:23:38,477
I get to sit next to
a self-important prick

2138
01:23:38,478 --> 01:23:41,614
Who believes himself
to be God's gift to women.

2139
01:23:41,615 --> 01:23:43,682
I'm referring to you, Dale.

2140
01:23:43,683 --> 01:23:44,683
- I figured.

2141
01:23:44,684 --> 01:23:46,519
- Okay, I just want to be clear.

2142
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,721
So let me just set you
and the station

2143
01:23:48,722 --> 01:23:50,723
And our viewing audience
straight on a few things.

2144
01:23:50,724 --> 01:23:53,292
First of all, my title,
"Sassy weather girl,"

2145
01:23:53,293 --> 01:23:54,326
Is inaccurate.

2146
01:23:54,327 --> 01:23:55,561
I am not a girl.

2147
01:23:55,562 --> 01:23:56,629
I am a woman.

2148
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:59,231
And I really
hate the word "Sassy."

2149
01:23:59,232 --> 01:24:00,232
It's stupid.

2150
01:24:00,233 --> 01:24:01,700
- Uh, go in tight on Dale.

2151
01:24:01,701 --> 01:24:03,068
- I mean, yes,
I have an attitude,

2152
01:24:03,069 --> 01:24:04,202
But wouldn't you,

2153
01:24:04,203 --> 01:24:06,405
If you had to listen
to Dale Waters all day?

2154
01:24:06,406 --> 01:24:07,807
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2155
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,008
We have a real responsibility
to deliver the news here--

2156
01:24:10,009 --> 01:24:11,109
- Shut up, Dale.

2157
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:15,347
I am not finished.

2158
01:24:15,348 --> 01:24:17,817
You know, there was a time
not too long ago

2159
01:24:17,818 --> 01:24:20,085
Where you sat here
and apologized for me

2160
01:24:20,086 --> 01:24:21,554
And my behavior.

2161
01:24:21,555 --> 01:24:22,855
And now it's my turn.

2162
01:24:22,856 --> 01:24:24,723
- Go in tighter.

2163
01:24:24,724 --> 01:24:26,692
- I am sorry,

2164
01:24:26,693 --> 01:24:30,028
Not for freaking out then
and not for freaking out now,

2165
01:24:30,029 --> 01:24:33,065
But for selling out,
for coming back here,

2166
01:24:33,066 --> 01:24:37,102
For even considering dating
this horribly inadequate man.

2167
01:24:37,103 --> 01:24:38,904
When I--When I got the offer
to come back here,

2168
01:24:38,905 --> 01:24:40,906
I compromised all of my ideals,

2169
01:24:40,907 --> 01:24:45,511
And I left behind the only
people who stood by me.

2170
01:24:45,512 --> 01:24:49,047
These friends
were honest with me

2171
01:24:49,048 --> 01:24:51,851
And wanted what I should have:

2172
01:24:51,852 --> 01:24:54,219
To be better than I was.

2173
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:58,323
They saw me as more
than just a sassy weather girl,

2174
01:24:58,324 --> 01:24:59,525
And I blew them off,

2175
01:24:59,526 --> 01:25:01,193
And I rationalized it all,

2176
01:25:01,194 --> 01:25:03,496
And I am ashamed of myself,

2177
01:25:03,497 --> 01:25:07,099
And I'm sorry.

2178
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,969
Dale, you were right.

2179
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:12,237
I never loved you.

2180
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:15,073
I mean, I loved the idea of you,

2181
01:25:15,074 --> 01:25:18,878
But the truth is,
we have nothing in common.

2182
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:28,286
- Well, that was subtle.

2183
01:25:28,287 --> 01:25:29,555
- Well, that's how I roll.

2184
01:25:29,556 --> 01:25:30,923
- Some would describe it
as sassy.

2185
01:25:30,924 --> 01:25:33,425
- Okay, no, it's--
No.

2186
01:25:33,426 --> 01:25:35,360
- Like, I'm--
I'm proud of you, you know?

2187
01:25:35,361 --> 01:25:36,395
- Thank you.

2188
01:25:36,396 --> 01:25:37,696
- And you can
crash with me again,

2189
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:39,398
You know, now that you're
unemployed again.

2190
01:25:39,399 --> 01:25:40,499
- Yes, that would be good.

2191
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,934
I have a huge signing bonus
to repay.

2192
01:25:41,935 --> 01:25:43,402
I could use a place to stay
for a while.

2193
01:25:43,403 --> 01:25:44,737
- Great.

2194
01:25:44,738 --> 01:25:46,739
You know, you couldn't possibly
ruin my social life

2195
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:49,942
Any more than you already have,
so...

2196
01:25:49,943 --> 01:25:51,476
- you're a good brother.

2197
01:25:51,477 --> 01:25:53,746
- I'm just trying to stop you
from ruining the family name.

2198
01:25:53,747 --> 01:25:55,180
- Could you have one
serious moment?

2199
01:25:55,181 --> 01:25:56,181
- No.

2200
01:25:56,182 --> 01:25:57,182
- Okay.

2201
01:25:57,183 --> 01:25:59,117
- Okay.

2202
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:02,721
- Hey.

2203
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:04,890
- Hey.

2204
01:26:04,891 --> 01:26:08,360
Um, hi.

2205
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:09,962
Hey, Walt.

2206
01:26:09,963 --> 01:26:12,565
- Hey, Byron.

2207
01:26:14,167 --> 01:26:16,168
- Okay, uh, Sylvia,

2208
01:26:16,169 --> 01:26:18,470
I really need to talk to you,

2209
01:26:18,471 --> 01:26:20,839
And it's kind of important

2210
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:26,979
And potentially
very embarrassing for me, so...

2211
01:26:28,181 --> 01:26:29,648
- hey, I'll just
wait outside, then.

2212
01:26:29,649 --> 01:26:30,649
- Good.
Thank you.

2213
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:32,350
- Cool.

2214
01:26:33,653 --> 01:26:34,653
- Hi.

2215
01:26:34,654 --> 01:26:36,655
- Hi, um...

2216
01:26:36,656 --> 01:26:38,757
I've been thinking a lot,
okay?

2217
01:26:38,758 --> 01:26:41,560
I've been thinking a lot
about you and me,

2218
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:44,063
And I'm thinking that I just
need to come out and tell you

2219
01:26:44,064 --> 01:26:45,831
How I feel about--

2220
01:26:53,006 --> 01:26:54,272
- I'm sorry.

2221
01:26:54,273 --> 01:26:56,842
I was such an idiot.

2222
01:26:56,843 --> 01:26:57,943
Look, the truth is,

2223
01:26:57,944 --> 01:27:00,345
I really, really,
really like you.

2224
01:27:00,346 --> 01:27:01,680
I didn't mean to,
but I do.

2225
01:27:01,681 --> 01:27:04,382
And you mean more to me
than a rich guy

2226
01:27:04,383 --> 01:27:07,820
Or a grown-up guy
or a guy with a job--

2227
01:27:07,821 --> 01:27:08,821
- I have a job.

2228
01:27:08,822 --> 01:27:10,322
- No, I know you do.

2229
01:27:10,323 --> 01:27:12,891
And that's not--

2230
01:27:12,892 --> 01:27:15,060
The point is, I--

2231
01:27:15,061 --> 01:27:20,733
You mean more to me
than all of those things.

2232
01:27:20,734 --> 01:27:24,402
I think that, um...

2233
01:27:24,403 --> 01:27:26,438
no, I do.

2234
01:27:26,439 --> 01:27:29,908
I love you, okay?

2235
01:27:29,909 --> 01:27:32,410
I love you.

2236
01:27:32,411 --> 01:27:34,980
What do you think?

2237
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,921
- You--You fully just
stole my moment.

2238
01:27:42,922 --> 01:27:44,089
- What?
- No, I'm serious.

2239
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:45,791
I was ready to come down here

2240
01:27:45,792 --> 01:27:47,926
And throw all my chips
on the table, you know?

2241
01:27:47,927 --> 01:27:50,262
Prepare to go down
in flames,

2242
01:27:50,263 --> 01:27:53,966
And then you go ahead,
and you steal the whole thing.

2243
01:27:53,967 --> 01:27:56,401
You make that cool--
Cool little speech,

2244
01:27:56,402 --> 01:28:02,407
And then I'm left standing here
like an asshole.

2245
01:28:02,408 --> 01:28:05,778
- Well, you could make a speech
if you want.

2246
01:28:05,779 --> 01:28:06,779
- And follow that?

2247
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:07,780
That was a great speech.

2248
01:28:07,781 --> 01:28:09,247
I can't follow that.

2249
01:28:09,248 --> 01:28:10,683
- Sorry.

2250
01:28:10,684 --> 01:28:13,018
- It's okay.

2251
01:28:13,019 --> 01:28:17,089
- So what do you think?

2252
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:19,357
- I kind of feel the, um--

2253
01:28:19,358 --> 01:28:22,294
I love you too.

2254
01:28:22,295 --> 01:28:24,596
- You do?

2255
01:28:24,597 --> 01:28:28,600
- You know I do.

2256
01:28:28,601 --> 01:28:32,938
Now, look,
I am going to grab you,

2257
01:28:32,939 --> 01:28:35,841
And I am going to kiss you.

2258
01:28:35,842 --> 01:28:36,842
- Okay.
- Okay?

2259
01:28:36,843 --> 01:28:38,476
And I am going to take the lead,

2260
01:28:38,477 --> 01:28:40,145
And you are gonna let me.

2261
01:28:40,146 --> 01:28:41,479
Here it comes.

2262
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,248
All right.

2263
01:28:43,249 --> 01:28:46,018
- You can do that now.
- Okay.

2264
01:28:47,854 --> 01:28:51,556
- In all, 15 peoples died
in that horrible crash.

2265
01:28:53,226 --> 01:28:57,162
And I'm sure everyone here
thinks that--

2266
01:28:57,163 --> 01:28:58,964
That that is terrible.

2267
01:28:58,965 --> 01:29:03,568
I mean, I'll keep a thought
in my heart

2268
01:29:03,569 --> 01:29:08,673
For, uh, those poor people--
Family.

2269
01:29:08,674 --> 01:29:11,043
- What a prick.

2270
01:29:11,044 --> 01:29:12,477
Go to commercial.
