00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,500
- Shuji, what's the matter with you?!
- Run!

2
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,530
Nakamichi, come with me.

3
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,860
- Shuji!
- Hurry!

4
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,580
Why are you running?

5
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,860
Come with me!

6
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,140
Nakamichi, run, quickly!

7
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,920
There always is someone following you.

8
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,400
Tax collectors?

9
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,000
Today the police

10
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,380
has interrupted my public speech.

11
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,150
Maybe you were shouting
in the loudspeaker...

12
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,080
I was only talking cinema!

13
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,300
One day you might get yourself
into real trouble.

14
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,140
You aren't Yukio Mishima!

15
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,860
Times have changed,

16
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,200
the people and the police are not
as tolerant as they used to be.

17
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,190
Hadn't it been for this evening's
projection, I wouldn't have run away.

18
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,750
If they arrest you,
there won't be a projection.

19
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,260
I am tired!

20
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,790
Wherever I go,

21
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,130
there's someone who wants
to stop me with some kind of law.

22
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,670
Why do I need a permit for?!

23
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,380
Is there no place left
where I can show a film?!

24
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,870
That's absurd!

25
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,950
Cinema will die.

26
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,160
May those who destroy
the cinema be cursed!

27
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,900
May those who destroy
the cinema be cursed!

They don't have the right to destroy
the great cinema.

46
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,760
Little by little they're putting it under!

47
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,320
They're holding it locked up
like a bird in a cage

48
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,640
<i>and then they'll kill it.</i>

49

The great masters' legacy

58
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,750

59
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,430
I want to make the kind of films
you and the other masters made.

60
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,630
I want to make my films.

61
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,170
Cinema is dying.

62
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,520

63
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,480

64
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,120
<i>Hi everyone</i>

65
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,240
<i>and welcome to the 78th projection.</i>

66
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,320
<i>There's a wind blowing tonight.</i>

67
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,880
But it's really worth seeing
this films.

68
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,330
They are two silent films,

69
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,360
the wind bristle will provide
a pleasant sound track.

70
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,610
I hope you'll agree.

71
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,940
As you well know,

72
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,760
we don't have where to
project the films,

73
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,800
that's why we had to move

74
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,200
in this small space.

75
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,600
Thanks to Tokyo Cinephile's support

76
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,560
we can project these
beautiful films here,

77
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,180
and, for that, I give them my thanks.

78
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,580
So,

79
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,250
tonight we'll see...

80
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:39,040
a 1924 Buster Keaton silent film,

81
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,240
and a Hiroshi Shimizu
silent short.

82
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,520
They were both shot some 80 years ago,

83
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,710
and they still strike us
by their topicality.

84
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,990
After the projection
we'll be having a discussion.

85
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,430
Have a nice viewing!

86
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,810
Let's enjoy the wind sound track!

87
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,360
Did you know your brother
was working for us?

88
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,670
Did you?

89
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,180
He used to say that,
if he'd manage to sell your films,

90
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,420
he'd pay the money back,

91
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,610
but that moment never came,

92
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,820
so he went on asking for money
at high interest rates.

93
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,360
Twelve years...

94
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,570
Shingo was with us for twelve years:

95
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,690
He was like a son to me.

96
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,240
Whatever we'd ask him to do,

97
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,840
he'd do it without complaining.

98
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,320
<i>I trusted Shingo.</i>

99
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,920
<i>But those were the boss's money</i>

100
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,730
<i>and Shingo knew it.</i>

101
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,370
<i>I tried to help him buy some time...</i>

102
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,170
but he

103
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,710
went to make money somewhere else

104
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,360
and without telling us anything

105
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,770
sold our turf to the Chinese mob.

106
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,810
We had to make him pay.

107
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:44,400
Your brother was a shilo,
a professional,

108
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,160
he knew the rules.

109
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,030
Whoever borrows money

110
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,680
he knows very well what can happen
to him if he doesn't repay his debt.

111
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,770
This

112
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,650
is the grand total of Shingo's debt.

113
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,890
¥12,540,000.

114
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,080
I don't have this kind of money.

115
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,240
The only thing that I've got

116
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,660
are three films shot with the money
my brother lent me.

117
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,010
You've got two weeks,

118
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,780
only two weeks to make good
on this debt.

119
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,830
And remember,

120
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,430
we're also adding the interest.

121
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,280
If you don't,
the Boss will resort to measures.

122
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,760
We'll force you to work for us,

123
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,620
or we'll kill you
to pocket your insurance.

124
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,530
This was your brother's bottle.

125
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,280

<i>It seems I can't get hold of you.</i>

128
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,180
<i>I'm in big trouble.</i>

129
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,890
I'm too ashamed to answer.

130
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,760
What will I do without you?

131
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,930
Brother...

132
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,820
<i>Shuji. It's me.</i>

133
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,170
- What will I do?
- <i>Answer!</i>

134
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,240
<i>They are after me.</i>

135
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,260
<i>Where did you end up?</i>

136
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,310
<i>Shuji. I am out of time.</i>

137
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,270
<i>Where are you?</i>

138
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,880
<i>You're never at home.</i>

139
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,050
<i>Call me.</i>

140
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,520
<i>I'm in danger. I must talk to you.</i>

141
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,820
The money?

142
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,420
- Have another game!
- Shut up!

143
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,780
- I'll lend you the money.
- Get lost!

144
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,210
You know you are not safe in here...

145
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,200
This is the safest place for me.

146
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:23,830
Where's the mahjong money?

147
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,490
Time has run out.

148
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,970
I'll have it tomorrow.

149
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,600
Listen...

150
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,850
Don't let him in,
if he doesn't have money.

151
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,390
Uncle, he's Shingo's brother...

152
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,410
I don't care, throw him out.

153
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,150
If the Boss finds out he's here,
we're in deep shit.

154
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,720
Take it,

155
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,560
it's part of the money I owe you.

156
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,890
If you play smart with the Boss,
you'll end up like your brother did.

157
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,500
Tell me where my brother was killed.

158
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,890
What do you want to do?

159
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,560
There were blood stains
of his blood on the window sill.

160
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,280
I cleaned everything up.

161
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,560
<i>What the fuck did you say?!</i>

162
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,200
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

163
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,470
<i>That's not how you play.</i>

164
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,620
<i>You've cheated!</i>

165
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,770
<i>Don't you play smart with me.
Asshole!</i>

166
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,880
<i>Say that again if you have guts!</i>

167
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,690
<i>Repeat what you've just said!</i>

168
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,170
How dare you?!

169
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,470
Speak, you son of a bitch!

170
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,670
Look into my eyes and
repeat what you've said!

171
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,220
Understood, asshole?

172
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,920
That's enough!

173
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,530
Go fuck yourself!

174
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,860
- Who is he?
- Shingo's brother.

175
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,620
Hey, you, Shingo's brother...

176
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,730
- You must leave!
- I'll buy you a drink.

177
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,430
Please, <i>Takagaki-san!</i>

178
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:19,090
I am Takagaki, Masaki's friend, got it?

179
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,700
Yes.

I now want him to prove us that.

193

Hey, you!

194
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,820
Put this gun into your mouth

196
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,050

200
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,620

201

213
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,000

214
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,960

- Yes.

215
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,960

220

He says he is Shingo's brother.

221
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:16,040
This son of a bitch didn't load the gun.

222
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,540
He only made me lose time!

223
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,100
I am sorry!

224
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,800

225
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,760

What do you mean?

230
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,930
If you hit him, I'll give him ¥10,000.

231
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,920
Do you agree, or not?

<i>¥10.000 for a punch.</i>

233
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,450
Maybe that's too little for
Shingo's brother?

234
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,090
<i>Guys. Punch him in the head!</i>

235
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,350

01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,320
<i>Projection No 58,
"Late Spring" by Yasujiro Ozu.</i>

362
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:54,900
<i>"The Searchers" by John Ford.</i>

363
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:56,610
<i>A masterpiece.</i>

364
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:59,000
Two of the greatest endings
in the history of cinema.

365
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,860
Projection No 51:

366
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:05,790
"Shadows" by John Cassavetes,

367
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,240
from 1958, 62 viewers.

368
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:11,800
Come on!

369
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:36,370
Hi everyone.

370
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,840
<i>Tonight I'll show you</i>

371
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:47,480
<i>Kaneto Shindo's "The Naked Island".
From 1960.</i>

372
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:50,670
<i>I think</i>

373
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:53,920
"The Naked Island"

374
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:57,050
is one of the most important
Japanese black and white films

375
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:58,790
from all times.

376
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,010
At that time,

377
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:06,680
black and white Japanese films

378
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,590
were appreciated world wide.

379
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:11,320
We'll have time

380
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:14,360
to talk about this later on.

381
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:17,110
I'll answer your questions
after the projection.

382
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,560
For now,
enjoy watching "The Naked Island".

383
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:35,480
Did you get into a fight?

384
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:39,710
No, I fell down.

385
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,270
- All these bruises from falling down?
- Yes.

386
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,180
You lost it and came to blows,
didn't you?

387
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:51,720
No, I just stumbled.

388
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:55,190
Alright, I'll pretend I believe you.

389
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:02,430
You really are something else!

390
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,800
You go on with the projections,
even in the state you are in.

391
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:16,310
That's the least I can do,
as long as I can't make a film:

392
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:19,120
Nothing will prevent me.

393
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:28,830
What about you, Nakamichi?
Where are you with your script?

394
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:34,190
I've finished and showed it around,
but nothing gives.

395
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:39,360
It's been three years
I haven't made a film,

396
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,920
I feel I'm going nuts.

397
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:45,960
What about you?

398
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:49,950
I'm working on a script.

399
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,020
And how is it going?

400
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,990
I'm putting all of me into it.

401
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,080
Hello?

402
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,110
Speaking.

403
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:19,600
<i>What are your intentions?</i>

404
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:20,680
<i>Hey!</i>

405
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,330
<i>Hey!</i>

406
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:29,340
Hiroshi, here's ¥30,000.

407
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,810
Now I'll make him KO.

408
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:12,170
The Boss doesn't want
another death in here.

409
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:13,980
Go away!

410
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:23,570
But he won't be able to repay
his debt this way.

411
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:26,070
Who do you think you are talking to?

412
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:28,550
I must do it in here.

413
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:33,560
Even if you kill me,
l won't leave from here.

414
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:38,130
Then, you'll pay rent for the bathroom:
¥100,000 a day.

415
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,730
<i>These are the Boss's orders.
There's nothing to discuss.</i>

416
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:45,900
You have three days to pay your debt
and the rent.

417
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:48,610
I'll leave two of my men here.

418
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:51,670
You'll pay another ¥40,000
for them and their car.

419
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:55,430
If you die,
they'll get rid of your corpse.

420
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,170
I knew right from the start

421
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,880
that it'd happen.

422
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:28,280
I had warned you.

423
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:32,760
I'm sorry,

424
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:36,380
there's nothing I can do for you now.

425
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:40,750
<i>Time has almost run out.</i>

426
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,870
<i>Remember just one thing:</i>

427
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,340
<i>You can't trust the Boss.</i>

428
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,840
He every time says something else.

429
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:01,140
Why don't you give them the money
and get out of it?

430
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:14,870
<i>I'll lend you the money.</i>

431
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,590
This way...

432
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,350
...we'll end all this.

433
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:27,550
You'll give it back when you can.

434
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:44,740
If it's true you want to lend me money,

435
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,740
hit me for every <i>yen</i> that's left.

436
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,470
I can't hit you.

437
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:59,410
As you have your reasons
for not hitting me,

438
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,340
I too have my reasons

439
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:06,150
for not accepting money without being hit.

440
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:19,470
Money is not the issue.

441
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:25,140
Had that been the case,

442
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,760
I'd have gone rob a bank.

443
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:41,500
Until now,

444
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,820
<i>Masaki-san,</i>

445
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:46,490
I've caused a lot of trouble,

446
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:49,430
and I am very sorry for that.

447
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:56,890
You've even gone against the Boss
to help me out.

448
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,480
What's more,

449
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,730
in this bathroom,

450
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:05,730
you've allowed me to make money

451
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,950
<i>and for that I am in your debt.</i>

452
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:30,780
I had to pay the rent to those guys,

453
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:35,400
<i>that's why I made less money today.</i>

454
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:42,160
Tomorrow, I promise you,

455
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:45,650
I'll make up the difference.

456
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:15,640
"YASUJIRO OZU"

457
01:18:01,570 --> 01:18:03,500
How much have we made?

458
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:05,710
¥330,000.

459
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:22,540
How many days do I have left?

460
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,410
Two days.

461
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:28,940
You must pay the rent.

462
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,980
I must make more money!

463
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:36,180
<i>I must make more money!</i>

464
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:40,080
<i>Hit me. Punch me in the face!</i>

465

<i>The auction starts at ¥30,000!</i>

01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,700
<i>Come on. Hit me in the face!</i>

468
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,970
<i>I need money,</i>

Hit me in the face!

472
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:02,430
Come on, hit me!

473
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:11,730
I bid ¥30,000!

474

Hit me, hit me!

481
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:34,090
I'll pummel him now!

More!

485
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:19,150
I'm alive! I'm alive, damn it!

01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:22,690
I'm alive!

That's not enough.

Hiroshi, Hiroshi...

492
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:13,070
How much have we made?

493
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,700
How much have we made?

494
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:18,140
¥710,000.

495
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:20,500

Cinema is not a whore.

512
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,440
Cinema is art.

<i>Whose turn is it?</i>

<i>The cinema as an art is dying.</i>

<i>Those who make superficial movies.</i>

524

<i>Are killing the cinema!</i>

525
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:42,050

<i>Let's take back our cinema.
Let's grab it from the moneygrubbers!</i>

527

<i>We must bring the true
cinema back to life!</i>

528
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:58,890
<i>So that happens.
You must watch real films.</i>

529
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:07,470
<i>In the past. The cinema was
either art. Or entertainment.</i>

530
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:13,210
<i>In the past we were capable
of making quality cinema.</i>

531
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,350
<i>Don't forget that.</i>

532
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:18,370
<i>Let's see to that!</i>

533
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:24,500
<i>Today, multiplex cinema</i>

534
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:28,470
<i>only fulfills the most
trivial entertainment.</i>

535
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:36,760
<i>It's fair that entertainment films
should also exist.</i>

536
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:38,990
<i>But we mustn't lose the opportunity</i>

537
