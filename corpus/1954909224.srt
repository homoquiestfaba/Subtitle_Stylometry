1
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,940
When Your Legs Don't Work Like They Used To Before

2
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,500
And I Can't Sweep You Off Of Your Feet

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,130
Will Your Mouth Still Remember The Taste Of My Love?

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,900
Will Your Eyes Still Smile From Your Cheeks?

5
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:38,800
And Darling I Will Be Loving You 'Til We're 70

6
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:51,340
And Baby My Heart Could Still Fall As Hard At 23

7
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:01,210
And I'm Thinking 'Bout How People Fall In Love In Mysterious Ways

8
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,090
Maybe Just The Touch Of A Hand

9
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,390
Well, Me—I Fall In Love With You Every Single Day

10
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,590
And I Just Wanna Tell You I Am

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,800
So Honey Now

12
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,680
Take Me Into Your Loving Arms

00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,930
Place Your Head On My Beating Heart

15
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,750
I'm Thinking Out Loud

16
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,820
That Maybe We Found Love Right Where We Are

17
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,260
When My Hair's All But Gone And My Memory Fades

18
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,910
And The Crowds Don't Remember My Name

19
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,230
When My Hands Don't Play The Strings The Same Way

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,000
I Know You Will Still Love Me The Same

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:22,070
'Cause Honey Your Soul Could Never Grow Old It's Evergreen

22
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:34,050
And Baby Your Smile's Forever In My Mind And Memory

23
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:44,490
I'm Thinking 'Bout How People Fall In Love In Mysterious Ways

24
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,750
Maybe It's All Part Of A Plan

25
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,990
Well I'll Just Keep On Making The Same Mistakes

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,330
Hoping That You'll Understand

27
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,000
But Baby Now

00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,770

31
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,770
Thinking Out Loud

32
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,600
That Maybe We Found Love Right Where We Are
