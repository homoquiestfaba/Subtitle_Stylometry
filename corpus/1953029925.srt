Ready?

3
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:58,103
Oh! Shit!

4
00:00:58,173 --> 00:00:59,504
Goddamn it!

00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:43,216
Hello, there. Pennywise from Hermosa
Beach, California. How you doin'?

18
00:01:46,288 --> 00:01:49,621
You can take a garbage can
and throw it through a car window,

19
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:52,558
and someone will say, "What the hell
are you doing?" You know, it's punk.

20
00:01:52,628 --> 00:01:54,425
<i>You can do...</i>

21
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:56,623
<i>And just say "I'm punk. "</i>

22
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:03,504
It's just that kind of willfulness with a bit
of insanity thrown in, a whole ton of"Fuck you. "

23
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:07,570
Goin' against the grain when everyone
else tells you no, that's punk rock.

24
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:11,943
Punk rock was supposed to be about no responsibility,
no rules. I'm gonna to do things my way.

25
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:13,504
In your face. Whaaa!

26
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:20,310
<i>We're at The Wiltern an hour before
Social Distortion is gonna go on,</i>

27
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:23,552
and Betsy calls me, my wife, she goes,
"My water broke. I'm having a baby. "

28
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,616
And I'm just like, "Oh, God.
I don't know what to do. "

29
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:31,028
<i>You're gonna be the proud father
of a little girl.</i>

30
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,360
I remember at that point
it was like everything went silent.

31
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:38,703
Some of the guys were like,
"What, you're gonna have a kid?"

32
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:43,103
Having a baby changed everything.

33
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:46,705
And you hear that. You hear that.
And it totally did.

34
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:49,842
Wade, don't hit him
with a stick, please. Thank you.

35
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:55,787
I was on the street from a real
young age. I was headed for trouble.

36
00:02:55,857 --> 00:02:59,384
Our dads weren't there, man.
And so, fuck you.

37
00:03:01,763 --> 00:03:06,200
There's nothing really in the punk rock
ethos that prepares you for being a dad.

38
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:12,430
<i>#Do you remember #</i>

39
00:03:12,507 --> 00:03:18,707
<i># When you were young
and you wanted to set the world on fire? #</i>

40
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,372
<i># When you were young ##</i>

41
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:30,416
This picture was taken
on the day we got to Hawaii,

42
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:34,588
and I was playing in, uh,
Washington, D.C.

43
00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:36,153
It was my birthday.

44
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:39,394
<i>And I flew home and got in at midnight.</i>

45
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:42,232
<i>And then woke up the next morning...</i>

46
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:46,673
and got my kids and packed them up
and got on a plane and went to Hawaii.

47
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:49,336
And then we got there and that
was like the first day of vacation...

48
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:51,140
after I'd been gone for like three weeks.

49
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:55,673
So, it was, like, "Yay! Everyone's back
and it's normal time with Dad around again. "

50
00:03:57,886 --> 00:04:01,788
Are you giving me a doll... a Barbie
doll to take with me on the road? Yes!

51
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:04,155
I don't think she'd be very happy
on the road.

52
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:07,354
She might get in trouble
on the tour bus.

53
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:11,559
<i>I've been doing this for 20 years,
being a singer for a punk band.</i>

54
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:16,627
Rock belt. That's where
the magic happens.

55
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,107
Um, I'm not even sure
that these are clean.

56
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:22,200
I just found these, but, you know...

57
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:24,575
You want me to get you
a different pair?

58
00:04:24,646 --> 00:04:26,273
<i>We have a big album coming out.</i>

59
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:28,714
<i>You know, a lot of touring
in front of us.</i>

60
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:31,947
Got open house at school,
I'll be in Myrtle Beach.

61
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,148
Got a birthday party,
I'll be in West Palm Beach.

62
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:38,556
My anniversary,
I'll be in St. Petersburg.

63
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:41,494
<i>Sometimes I'll be here,
sometimes I'll be gone.</i>

64
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:45,761
No, I can't take 20 Barbies.
I'll take one.

65
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:49,133
<i>For the first time, my oldest daughter
said, "I hate it when you leave.</i>

66
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:51,798
<i>You know, I really don't like it. "</i>

67
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:53,306
<i>It's heartbreaking.</i>

68
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,107
<i>Twenty years on, Pennywise is still rockin'
with a new album coming out.</i>

69
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:02,116
<i>And, of course, Reason To Believe
is what that's called.</i>

70
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:07,781
<i>You're leaving right after the Key Club Show. Aren't you heading
toJapan and then down to Australia, and you're gonna do it all.</i>

71
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,295
This is the ever-important shave kit.

72
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:23,532
Everything in there. Everything
I need to keep movin' on the road.

73
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,873
Antacids. Super important,
'cause you eat like shit.

74
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:36,780
Pennywise is like
one of the pillars of punk.

75
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:45,224
<i>Certainly in the punk of my generation, they are a
band that really stayed the course for so many years.</i>

76
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:48,957
Shake hands all day.
Gotta get hand sanitizer.

77
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:56,037
The hair dye.
Gotta keep the dream alive.

78
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,740
<i>Keep people thinking that I'm 20,
when I'm twice that age.</i>

79
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:05,644
Pennywise took us on our
first Australian tour ever.

80
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:09,047
<i>Right then, Pennywise was breaking
in Australia. Huge in Australia.</i>

81
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:11,711
<i>And Blink was nobody back then.</i>

82
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:13,516
They were like mentors to us.

83
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:16,682
Trimmer, 'cause now you're starting
to get hairs in weird places.

84
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:20,361
Bunch of hats to hide the "receda. "

85
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:23,193
Receding hairline has
to be hidden from view.

86
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:31,295
That's okay, guys. I got it.

87
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:49,582
# I say #

88
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:06,701
<i># We're gonna open your eyes #</i>

89
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:09,073
# Frustration, domination #

90
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:11,476
# Feel the rage of a new generation #

91
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:13,707

92
00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:15,477
<i>#And we're never gonna stop #</i>

93
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,711
# Stop tryin' #

94
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:20,050
# Stop tryin' #

95
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:22,419
# Stop tryin' #

96
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:24,482
<i>#Stop tryin'##</i>

97
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:33,533
I have my first two daughters' names
tattooed, but, um, I don't have the third yet.

98
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:36,002
It's taken a long time,
and now they're kinda fighting...

99
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:40,337
over who gets Kate's name
on their side.

100
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:46,236
You're a rose.

101
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:48,282
And what am I?

102
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,478
I could make you a rhinoceros.
What do you want?

103
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:53,817
I don't know.
An armadillo.

104
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:56,016
No!

105
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,490
Nope.
A unicorn.

106
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,186
Unicorn?
A butterfly. A butterfly.

107
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:02,321
Unicorn, I don't know. I think those
tattoos have kinda gone out of style.

108
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:04,797
I want to be a butterfly.
You want to be a butterfly?

109
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:09,360
These are all very girlie tattoos.
You got to remember I'm a dude, so...

110
00:08:09,437 --> 00:08:12,463
All right, we have to go. We're
gonna be late for this thing anyways.

111
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:16,807
Bye. Okay. Love you
girls. Have them go to bed.

112
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:20,507
<i>Homework, bath, bed.
American Idol. American Idol.</i>

113
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:24,279
<i>American Idol, bath,
bed. Okay, love you. Bye.</i>

114
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:34,624
I told her this morning...

115
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:38,689
Uh, I go, "Kate, I'm getting your name
tattooed tonight. " And she was so excited.

116
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:42,203
<i>I think she even wanted to share it
at school today during her "share"thing.</i>

117
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,329
<i>Other kids are sharing, like, their dolls...</i>

118
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:48,399
<i>and mine's sharing that her dad's
getting her name tattooed.</i>

are feeling the same way.</i>

127
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:18,963
<i>Before, I think, when we were younger, we were all very
nihilistic and didn't care. Live for today, live fast.</i>

<i>We grew up at a...
during a different time.</i>

134
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:45,924
We were kinda left
to our own devices.

135
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,730
I didn't have
a male role model.

136
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:51,294
Male role models in my life
were my dad, who left, right?

137
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,238
Didn't-Didn't pay
child support.

138
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:57,108
Didn't, um, own up
to his responsibilities.

139
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:59,078
I used to have to salute him.

140
00:09:59,147 --> 00:10:02,139
"Jack Grisham reporting for
inspection, sir," when he got home.

141
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:06,745
My dad once told me, uh, if I ever
get my ears pierced, he'd yank 'em out.

142
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:08,812
My dad hated me.
He hated me.

143
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,859
I don't know what it is,
but your thinking changes.

144
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:16,625
You're that guy that tied a screw out of
your neck, and you become Ward Cleaver.

145
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:18,290
And Ward Cleaver's a prick.

146
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:21,233
You march right back upstairs,
young man, and put on a clean shirt.

147
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:26,262
All right, homie, I think we're gonna get
ready and go to dinner. You got your stuff?

148
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:29,606
I was doing my chores
and I was washing my dad's truck,

149
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:32,306
and I was listening to a
Descendents's song, and he walked out.

150
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,143
It was a song
called "Parents. "

151
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:37,946
And, uh, the, uh...
the hook of the song is...

152
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:42,285
"Parents, why won't they shut
up? Parents, they're so f'ed up. "

153
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:46,191
And, uh, he walked out right when that
was playing, didn't like that song.

154
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,024
And I remember
he ejected the cassette...

155
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:52,032
and took it and threw it in the bucket
of water I was washing his car with.

156
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:56,464

cocksucker, motherfucker #

#Tits, fart, dirty twat #

160
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:06,946
<i>I mean, punk rock, in general,
is really nihilistic.</i>

161
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:08,676
It was just about doing
whatever you want.

162
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,651
And usually whatever you want
meant causing a lot of trouble...

163
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,382
<i>and doing everything that your parents
didn't want you to do.</i>

164
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:16,356
#Tits, fart, dirty twat #

165
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:19,052
# I fucked your mom ##

166
00:11:21,563 --> 00:11:26,330
<i>Thank you.
Thank you so very, very much.</i>

167
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:32,636
How did we go from rebelling against your
own parents to become parents ourselves?

168
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:43,484
<i>I just remember going out on the blacktop
in kindergarten the first time...</i>

169
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:46,782
<i>and just having all those kids look at me
like, "There's something wrong with you,"</i>

170
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:48,618
<i>and, like, looking at me strange.</i>

171
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:53,060
<i>And this one guy looked at me and said,
"Oh, yeah. You do that.</i>

172
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:56,154
You make that funny face
and we'll go scare the girls. "

173
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:57,698
I was born totally cross-eyed.

174
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:04,871
<i>So it'd be like someone who's like
with irregular faces scaring kids.</i>

175
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:06,873
It, you know, had a weird effect on me.

176
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:10,741
<i>From an early age, I started acting out
and acting like a total freak...</i>

177
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:13,474
<i>just to have people
look past my eye condition.</i>

178
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:16,676
<i>And so right when I entered junior high
and I was getting in trouble all the time,</i>

179
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:22,246
<i>it was right then when this big musical
bomb dropped on the cultural landscape...</i>

180
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:24,086
<i>and altered music forever.</i>

181
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:37,435
<i>I was 12 years old in 1977.</i>

182
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:39,996
<i>It was a really important time
for me musically,</i>

183
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:44,135
<i>because that's really when music
becomes a huge part of your life.</i>

184
00:12:44,212 --> 00:12:48,478
I started playing with Fear,
I guess in 1980 or 1981?

185
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,713
<i>Punk rock had already been going
for, like, three or four years or something.</i>

186
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:54,721
You have to be the perfect stereotypical
California teenager.

187
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:58,555
And if that's not you, you better stand
out in some way or else you're a loser.

188
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:01,356
So, like, for me, it was, like,
well, I better find something.

189
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:04,489
<i>Thank God I got the guitar
and started playing it.</i>

190
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:15,503
<i>I think the L.A. Scene...</i>

191
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:19,536
<i>I think it was less about fashion
than New York or London.</i>

192
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:21,946
<i>L.A. 's a funny city, you know.</i>

193
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:26,953
<i>It's just a big, sprawling thing,
and people get really lonely here.</i>

194
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:31,822
<i>L.A. Was more
like these kind oflike...</i>

195
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:35,624
<i>desolate people, kind of desperate
people, all kind of coming together.</i>

196
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:37,631
It was a real feeling of bonding.

197
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:41,499
And a real feeling of community.
And a real feeling of belonging.

198
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,837
<i>#I love livin'in the city #</i>

199
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:53,838
<i>#I love livin'in the city #</i>

200
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:00,652
<i>#My house smells just like the zoo #</i>

201
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:03,748
<i>#It's chock full of shit and puke #</i>

202
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:06,316
Punk rock, when it started,
there weren't so many of us.

203
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:09,420
So when you were driving down the street,
if you saw somebody with purple hair,

204
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:11,590
you'd pull over and go,
"Hey, what are you into, man?"

205
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:15,261
<i>And it was that instant kinship
which was really cool.</i>

206
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:18,635
It wasn't cool to be a punk rocker. Like you
walk down the street, people yelled at you.

207
00:14:18,706 --> 00:14:21,436
They made fun of you. They beat
you up. They threw shit at you.

208
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:25,570
You can't look like you're fitting in to
society if you don't want to fit in society.

209
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:28,343
I used to get beat up every day
for having green hair.

210
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:32,375
<i>And it was a bunch of misfits who all
came from the same kind ofbackground.</i>

211
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:34,148
<i>And you felt like you fit in finally.</i>

212
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:39,353
You were, like, "Whoa! Where the fuck did this
come from? Why didn't I find this last year?"

213
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:45,362
<i>Here's this group of people that will definitely
accept me, no matter how screwed up I am.</i>

214
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:48,664
And, you know, that was a feeling they couldn't
get at home, they couldn't get anywhere else.

215
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:53,366
And it was important to find that in
life, or else you just feel cast out.

216
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:05,108
<i>I think in Hermosa Beach back then,
it was a very strange place to grow up.</i>

217
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:09,646
<i>Even though we're at the beach and everything's nice and
it's clean and with everything we could possibly want,</i>

218
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:12,625
<i>the underbelly of it all is rotting.</i>

219
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:24,935
<i>You had this huge military
defense complex surrounding you.</i>

220
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:30,740
<i>You realized that your mom worked for Air Research
and your dad worked for TRWworking on satellites.</i>

221
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:34,839
All these things you read about in the paper are
being built, you know, two blocks from your house.

222
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,044
<i>The attacks slashed at North Vietnam
with renewed fury.</i>

223
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:42,055
<i>In our generation, our first images
of politicians...</i>

224
00:15:42,123 --> 00:15:44,023
<i>was President Nixon resigning.</i>

225
00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:47,084
<i>I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

226
00:15:47,161 --> 00:15:50,324
You had this spiraling
divorce rate in the '70s.

227
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:54,027
So a lot of broken homes, a lot of anger
that couldn't be expressed anywhere else.

228
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:59,631
It was supposed to be Ozzie and Harriet and the
Nelson family, and the perfect little family.

229
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:03,734
<i>But Vietnam and Nixon and all that
came along and ruined it.</i>

230
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:07,076
<i>It's almost like you're promised the
American dream, and you got the nightmare.</i>

231
00:16:07,148 --> 00:16:08,809
<i>But in reality, what can people do?</i>

232
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:10,976
<i>Do you go throw rocks at windows
or do you...</i>

233
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:14,715
<i>A lot of people decided to play music that
sounded like a rock going through a window.</i>

234
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:19,850
<i>It was like a powder keg
ready to explode, and it did.</i>

235
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:23,192
<i>In all of L.A., a lot of really influential bands
came from this area,</i>

236
00:16:23,264 --> 00:16:27,928
<i>but three of the biggest... Black Flag, CircleJerks
and Descendents... came from one tiny town.</i>

237
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:29,833
<i>And you'd see these guys
walking around.</i>

238
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:34,739
<i>But you'd also see their flyers, and they had these
really, really aggressive, really dark flyers...</i>

239
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:38,176
<i>from Raymond Pettibon,
that were really subversive.</i>

240
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:40,806
<i>A lot of them had pretty
hard core images on them...</i>

241
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:45,512
<i>that were against everything in society that
we supposedly hold dear... religion, politics.</i>

242
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:50,114
<i>#Die young #</i>

243
00:16:50,191 --> 00:16:52,352
<i>#Live fast, die young ##</i>

244
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:55,362
<i>I was part of the Black Flag fan club.</i>

245
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,331
<i>I remember bringing home Jealous Again,
the yellow album.</i>

246
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,836
That was the best music I'd ever heard
in my life, but especially the voice.

247
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:04,929
<i>Ron had a very expressive voice.</i>

248
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:11,241
<i>For me, even to this day, it's the most
explosive, genuine, raw album there is.</i>

249
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:13,405
# I don't care what you think #

250
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:16,006
<i>#I don't care what you think #</i>

251
00:17:17,718 --> 00:17:20,186
<i>#I don't care what you say #</i>

252
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:25,390
<i>That was exactly it...
"I don't care what you think. "</i>

253
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,928
And I felt that way so deeply.

254
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:29,792
Like, I don't care what you think.

255
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:32,628
<i>And to hear that just come right out
of those speakers,</i>

256
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,224
it was just like, yeah!

257
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:36,293
<i>#No, no, no, no, no values #</i>

258
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,895
<i>#No, no, no values ##</i>

259
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:43,669
I rented a place in this place
called The Church.

260
00:17:43,744 --> 00:17:48,738
And it became kind of the mecca
for the South Bay punk rock scene...

261
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:50,807
<i>that emerged in my living room.</i>

262
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:59,725
<i>When I was about 15 years old,
this guy hired me and my friend to work here.</i>

263
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:03,355
And it was across the street
from The Church.

264
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:06,161
In fact, that's why I took the job.
I really didn't want to work at all.

265
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:12,738
<i>It was huge for me. It was like a little kid
having Led Zeppelin living across the street.</i>

266
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:16,504
<i>So we kind of created this scene
out of, like, our rehearsal space.</i>

267
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:18,511
Everybody was doing
everything that you can imagine.

268
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:43,234
<i>#I was a fuck-up ## That's the one
difference from the New York scene...</i>

269
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:45,204
<i>and the London scene that I saw a lot.</i>

270
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:48,936
I mean, yeah, they were violent there,
but in California it was super violent.

271
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:55,006
<i>- #I was out of my head #
- Black Flag always made me want to go out and drink beer and smash stuff up.</i>

272
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:59,212
Like, it scared me, but it also gave me like
a boner at the same time, you know what I mean?

273
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,346
Just the troublemaking
is what attracted me.

274
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:03,117
<i>#I was so jacked up
I was so drunk up #</i>

275
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:05,989
<i>#I was so knocked out
I was out of my head #</i>

276
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,965
<i>#I was so wasted
I was wasted ##</i>

277
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:16,202
<i>And I went to go see, like, Black Flag,
and it was really violent.</i>

278
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,262
<i>And people were getting beat up
for having the wrong hair.</i>

279
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,537
And I mean beat up, not just like punched.
I mean, like, hospitalized.

280
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:27,206
And, like, constant. It was, like, ambulances
taking people away from shows all the time.

281
00:19:32,286 --> 00:19:34,220
<i>We had a lot of friends
die along the way.</i>

282
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:37,724
Some died of an overdose,
lot of psychological problems.

283
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:42,559
So, you know, and obviously, um, the
bass player for our band died later on.

284
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,532
<i>And, you know, you saw that happening
all the time. So it was like...</i>

285
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:50,335
<i>We knew the dangers were there.</i>

286
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:55,371
And that's what a lot of our songs
became about, you know...

287
00:19:55,443 --> 00:20:00,881
is, uh, you know, living every day
like it's your last, because it could be.

288
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:08,915
<i>It was angry. It was...</i>

289
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,654
<i>The lyrics spoke to me. The music
was loud and abrasive and fast.</i>

290
00:20:13,728 --> 00:20:16,959
The people that I went to school with
hated it. They hated me, I hated them.

291
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:19,727
It was perfect.
It was beautiful.

292
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,530
It was beautiful.
It was everything I needed.

293
00:20:22,603 --> 00:20:27,199
<i># Whoa, oh, oh, oh #</i>

294
00:20:28,342 --> 00:20:32,472
<i># Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh #</i>

295
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:38,180
<i># Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh #</i>

296
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:43,713
<i># Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh ##</i>

297
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,656
I thought we were gonna
change the world.

298
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,531
The whole thing boggles the
mind. It's, like, I don't know.

299
00:20:54,602 --> 00:20:58,003
You might say, hey, maybe punk
rock was never meant to grow up.

300
00:20:58,072 --> 00:21:00,802
But it did. So too bad.

301
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,641
You know, it's like we're
in uncharted territory, you know.

302
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:15,484
<i>#Happy birthday, dear Brighton #</i>

303
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:20,050
# Happy birthday to you ##

304
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:26,258
Hey, don't get so excited, Brighton.

305
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:29,770
That's it, darling.
You can do it.

306
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:35,707
You can do it.
Yay! Yes!

307
00:21:37,178 --> 00:21:41,512
#We are not men
We are DEVO #

308
00:21:41,582 --> 00:21:43,140
# D-E-V-O #

309
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:45,344
# Ba, ba, ba, ba,
ba, ba, ba, ba #

310
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:51,289
It's tough to be a punk rock hero and still be a good
authority figure for your kids. It's almost impossible.

311
00:21:53,828 --> 00:21:57,491
<i>When my wife and I decided to have a kid,
we made kind of a pact.</i>

312
00:21:57,565 --> 00:22:00,033
<i>Said we're not gonna change our life.</i>

313
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:04,037
We'll have a good time with the kid.

The cool thing about

354
00:24:42,663 --> 00:24:47,396
is that the expectation of me

00:32:25,692 --> 00:32:28,160
You know, sometimes you
think about, like, you know,

477
00:32:28,228 --> 00:32:31,823
"Oh, shit. Should I have
tattooed my forehead?" You know.

478
00:32:35,102 --> 00:32:36,694
Park.

479
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:39,068
We better get there
before they shut it down.

480
00:32:39,139 --> 00:32:41,573
<i>But, you know, that lasts
about two seconds.</i>

481
00:32:41,641 --> 00:32:43,734
Because, to be honest,
I am who I am.

482
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:49,271
<i>And hopefully, I will instill in my son
that you respect people on their merit,</i>

483
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:50,907
<i>not on the way that they look.</i>

484
00:32:50,984 --> 00:32:54,511
<i>#Said, who would've thought
the dreams come true? #</i>

485
00:32:54,588 --> 00:32:57,216
<i>#And who would've thought
I ended up with you? #</i>

486
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,157
<i>What's working is that
I live in San Francisco.</i>

487
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:04,664
<i>So you got to basically be naked on fire before
somebody's even going to bat an eye at you.</i>

488
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:08,497
So, I mean, I'm stoked.

489
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:13,505
<i>What are you doing? And I'm pretty sure
there's a lot more open-minded people here.</i>

490
00:33:13,573 --> 00:33:17,873
<i>It's not like I'm in, uh,
Little Rock, Arkansas, right now.</i>

491
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,304
Hey, you guys want to know
how to clear out a park?

492
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:23,076
That sounds great, yeah.

493
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,811
Bring the punker...
Turn on the camera.

494
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:27,183
Yeah, bring a punker
and the camera.

495
00:33:27,254 --> 00:33:30,985
Get this place to ourselves.
High five, pal. High five.

496
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:34,621
Let's go. Come on.
Let's go down the slide.

497
00:33:35,662 --> 00:33:40,656
<i>Lookin'like this, tryin'to raise a kid,
that might be a little tougher, you know.</i>

498
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:41,758
Crazy.

499
00:33:43,103 --> 00:33:45,867
<i>You don't want to do
anything that's gonna...</i>

500
00:33:45,939 --> 00:33:49,966
inhibit your child's progression
in life.

501
00:33:50,043 --> 00:33:54,241
<i>Because it's the most important
thing in my life is this kid now.</i>

502
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:59,013
<i>I kind of choose not to take on, like, could of,
would of, should of, or what will be or whatever.</i>

503
00:33:59,086 --> 00:34:01,179
<i>I kind of just like
try to stay in the moment.</i>

504
00:34:01,254 --> 00:34:06,487
<i>And, um, you know,
if I can win over her family...</i>

505
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,654
<i>I can win over a fucking school teacher.</i>

506
00:34:11,298 --> 00:34:13,232
You know what I mean? So...

507
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:16,600
Ohh!

508
00:34:19,906 --> 00:34:22,067
Look, he's eating a poo
right in front of you.

509
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:25,339
How's that taste, dog? Dude.

510
00:34:25,412 --> 00:34:28,643
This lady told me that
any bad habits your dog has,

511
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:32,014
it's actually your fault
for not training him right.

512
00:34:32,085 --> 00:34:35,782
So, when he lays a turd,
you put some Tabasco on it.

513
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:41,089
I can imagine my neighbor looking over and seeing me putting
Tabasco on a turd and wondering what the hell I'm doing.

514
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:44,858
Poop's on.

515
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:48,526
There you go. Try that on for
size. See how you like that.

516
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:03,743
Just the other day I was talking to my kid
and I was saying something...

517
00:35:03,817 --> 00:35:06,650
and she looked at me and went like...

518
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,018
And I could tell she had just turned off.

519
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:13,549
You know, she wasn't listening to me anymore and,
like, was giving me like a, "Oh, yeah, sure, Dad. "

520
00:35:13,627 --> 00:35:18,360
And right in the middle I go, "Don't give me
that look. That's... I invented that look. "

521
00:35:23,837 --> 00:35:28,672
If you want... If you want to request a Pennywise
song, you got to add a "fucking" in there.

522
00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:32,007
In the middle.
Like "Every Single Fucking Day. "

523
00:35:32,078 --> 00:35:34,205
Or "Living for Fucking Today. "

524
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:36,772
"Peaceful Fucking Day. "
"Peaceful Fucking Day. "

525
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,442
"My Own Fucking Country. "

526
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:41,385
"My Own Fucking Way of Life. "
"My Own Fucking Way of Life. "

527
00:35:41,454 --> 00:35:43,388
"Wouldn't It Be Fucking Nice?"

528
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:46,323
You got... You got
the fucking picture?

529
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:48,725
Penny-fucking-wise.

530
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,768
Emma, I'm not gonna warn
you again, honey, okay?

531
00:35:57,837 --> 00:36:00,328
Then you're gonna stay home
from Allison's.

532
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:06,476
<i>It's like you're supposed to be a, uh...
a model citizen for your little kid...</i>

533
00:36:06,546 --> 00:36:08,537
<i>and show them
the right thing to do.</i>

534
00:36:08,615 --> 00:36:10,708
Whereas, you know,
I'm the exact opposite of that.

535
00:36:12,652 --> 00:36:14,085
# Fuck 'em all ##

536
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:21,119
In the beginning, I probably let her do what
she wanted, but now I discipline her, for sure.

537
00:36:21,194 --> 00:36:25,062
I never hit her. I never
spank her. I pinch her.

538
00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:28,267
Do you want one of these?

539
00:36:28,335 --> 00:36:30,860
Do you want one of these?
No!

540
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:34,566
I just give her, like, the little
good pinch on her arm and she goes...

541
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:37,701
'Cause I don't have the heart to
smack her on her hands or her butt.

542
00:36:37,777 --> 00:36:43,079
But, like, I just figure I'll pinch her
and she'll get the point, you know?

543
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:49,015
Ready?
#Twinkle #

544
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:51,216
Hey, I just turned that off.

545
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:54,089
Hey, I'm turning it off, okay?
No.

546
00:36:58,098 --> 00:37:00,032
You know this one, right?

547
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,330
Not all of it.

548
00:37:02,402 --> 00:37:04,836
Sing a part that you know.

549
00:37:04,904 --> 00:37:06,838
I don't know all of it.

550
00:37:08,508 --> 00:37:10,066
You know how it goes?

551
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:13,579
I'll start it.
# Now I'm standing on a... #

552
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:15,547
# Rooftop #

553
00:37:15,615 --> 00:37:17,446
# Ready to fall #

554
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:19,007
# I think I'm at the... #

555
00:37:19,085 --> 00:37:20,814
# Edge now #

556
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:23,412
# But I could be... #
#Wrong #

557
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,855
# Now I'm standing on a... #

558
00:37:24,924 --> 00:37:26,619
That's all I know.
That's all you know?

559
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:27,751
# Ready #

560
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:31,786
# I'm standing on the rooftop
ready to fall #

561
00:37:31,865 --> 00:37:35,164
# I think I'm at the edge now,
but I could be wrong #

562
00:37:35,235 --> 00:37:40,605
# I'm standing on the rooftop
ready to fall #

563
00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:42,039
# Look out #

564
00:37:42,108 --> 00:37:44,975
# Now I'm standing on the rooftop
ready to fall #

565
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:49,607
Now we have to put it in the oven. The
oven? We're not putting this in the oven.

566
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:51,742
I've never microwaved
peanut butter before.

567
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:54,378
What if it... explodes?

568
00:37:54,454 --> 00:37:56,684
You scared me.

569
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:59,156
#... won't take me #

570
00:37:59,225 --> 00:38:02,319
# Heights don't phase me #

571
00:38:02,395 --> 00:38:05,159
# So take a step #

572
00:38:05,231 --> 00:38:10,032
# But don't look down
Take a step #

573
00:38:10,103 --> 00:38:13,937
# I'm standing on the rooftop
ready to fall #

574
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:21,071
I think Mom and Dad
make the rules.

575
00:38:21,147 --> 00:38:23,342
I think that's how it goes.
Right?

576
00:38:26,753 --> 00:38:28,687
You're in charge of
your playhouse? Mm-hmm.

577
00:38:28,755 --> 00:38:29,813
Okay.

578
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:34,385
How many playhouses do you have?
Are you a playhouse tycoon?

579
00:38:35,995 --> 00:38:38,088
Right now, Boston!

580
00:38:38,164 --> 00:38:40,132
We got to take care
of each other!

581
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,135
We'll see you next time! Peace!

582
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:02,145
<i>Ron, can you show us
where you live, please?</i>

583
00:39:02,222 --> 00:39:06,750
<i>You mean, like, specifically,
like where I sleep? Yeah.</i>

584
00:39:06,826 --> 00:39:09,556
<i>Okay, well, this room is where I live.</i>

585
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:15,329
<i>This is... This is a two-room apartment
here, right? Yeah, this is a...</i>

586
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,405
<i>I can't rent a house because
I owe the gas company money.</i>

587
00:39:20,473 --> 00:39:24,375
<i>I owe the electrical company money.
I owe the telephone company money.</i>

588
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:27,811
<i>So I can't rent a house under my name.</i>

589
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:31,977
<i>So I might as well live in a fucking closet
for $ 16.00 a month, you know.</i>

590
00:39:37,657 --> 00:39:40,785
<i>I think what's happening is, like,
with me, I'm noticing that actually...</i>

591
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,761
<i>I've turned a little bit more
into my dad...</i>

592
00:39:44,464 --> 00:39:46,932
<i>than I would have ever thought
I would have.</i>

593
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,490
Let's go inside.

594
00:39:52,372 --> 00:39:55,933
Oh, no. Oh, no? What
do you mean, oh, no?

595
00:39:56,009 --> 00:39:59,968
This is a great record. I wonder if
they have the first Blondie record?

596
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:01,479
Um...

597
00:40:01,548 --> 00:40:04,016
<i>I would go for this one...
Dirty Deeds...</i>

598
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:07,211
because it's got my favorite AC/DC
song on it. It has my favorite.

599
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:09,118
"Ride On. "
It has "Rocker" on it.

600
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:10,679
Okay, so there you go.

601
00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:12,520
This one has your dad on it.

602
00:40:12,592 --> 00:40:16,358
This was recorded in Hermosa Beach where we
used to live. Where I used to live, of course.

603
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:19,193
So, um, yeah, what a trip.

604
00:40:19,265 --> 00:40:25,261
Me and Jessica Mclntryre looked up
you on Wikipedia and we found...

605
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:27,363
a bunch of stuff.

606
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,930
That's hilarious.

607
00:40:40,653 --> 00:40:42,245
<i>When Di and I had kids,</i>

608
00:40:42,322 --> 00:40:46,053
we tried hanging on
to some of that, you know.

609
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:51,085
Going out, going to gigs,
getting a little bit wasted...

610
00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:56,158
<i>and coming back and, like, you know,
trying to breast-feed and change diapers.</i>

611
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:59,171
<i>And it just... It doesn't work.</i>

612
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:01,901
<i>And God bless anybody
who's made it work.</i>

613
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:05,376
<i>But for us, it was like,
"This is not gonna work. "</i>

614
00:41:05,445 --> 00:41:10,576
<i>I don't know if it was a conscious thing. We didn't sit down
one day and say, "Hey, let's not be punk rockers anymore. "</i>

615
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:15,451
<i>But there was a definite, uh,
switch in priorities as far as our life priorities.</i>

616
00:41:15,522 --> 00:41:19,117
And it became more like, "Well, because, you
know, I actually have to pay for these diapers. "

617
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:30,567
<i>#A guitar #</i>

they need to have their diapers changed,</i>

622
00:41:42,815 --> 00:41:45,340
<i>they need to go to the doctor,
you need health insurance.</i>

623
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:49,115
And then you need a house for them and then
you need clothes and you have a mortgage.

624
00:41:49,188 --> 00:41:53,056
And then all of a sudden the system that
you are fighting against or trying to change,

625
00:41:53,126 --> 00:41:55,117
<i>you become part of that system.</i>

Everybody who has high ideals
at some point has a crisis,

you know, when they have to actually get food
on the table and take care of other people.

632
00:42:18,985 --> 00:42:23,513
No one joined Pennywise to make money.
No one joined Rancid to make money.

633
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:27,026
No one, uh... We didn't start
the Vandals to make money.

00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,725
<i>We're a working-class band.</i>

636
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:35,529
<i>It's not like we have Learjets
picking us up...</i>

637
00:42:35,602 --> 00:42:38,969
<i>or, you know, manservants
doing stuff for us.</i>

638
00:42:39,038 --> 00:42:42,269
<i>Are you really supposed to make money
from, uh... from rock music?</i>

639
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:46,870
Do you deserve an income from rock music,
especially if you want to have kids too?

640
00:42:46,946 --> 00:42:50,404
Isn't rock music
for the wild, rambling guy...

641
00:42:50,483 --> 00:42:53,646
<i>who maybe has kids he doesn't
know about in each town?</i>

642
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,588
<i>And doesn't pay his taxes.
And has a drug problem.</i>

643
00:42:57,657 --> 00:43:01,218
And dies when he's 34, 35.

644
00:43:01,294 --> 00:43:04,593
<i>#It's time to bring it back ##</i>

645
00:43:06,132 --> 00:43:11,160
Your life goes through stages, and I don't
think any of us when we started punk rock,

646
00:43:11,237 --> 00:43:15,037
uh, looked at punk rock
as a career decision...

647
00:43:15,108 --> 00:43:18,669
with a long-term, uh, career path
and a pension plan.

648
00:43:20,313 --> 00:43:25,046
<i>It's funny in the punk scene, because, you
know, I try to always instill that Pennywises,</i>

649
00:43:25,118 --> 00:43:26,915
the Bad Religions,
the NOFX's,

650
00:43:26,986 --> 00:43:30,513
the bands are starting to go on
their 20, 25 years of existence.

651
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:34,651
And it's not been that meteoric
rise and fall of these bands.

652
00:43:34,727 --> 00:43:38,686
It's just been a steady...
how do you make this a steady business?

653
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:40,924
Oh, God, it's killing everybody, dude.

654
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,127
How long do you think
you can keep doing it...

655
00:43:43,202 --> 00:43:47,229
and, you know, supporting your
kid and helping out with the...

656
00:43:47,306 --> 00:43:52,801
I mean, as far you want to count
on record sales, it's over, man.

657
00:43:52,879 --> 00:43:54,369
I mean, right now it is.

658
00:43:54,447 --> 00:43:57,712
I mean, there's no way we're gonna make
any money on record sales.

659
00:43:57,784 --> 00:44:01,720
For a long time,
we stayed on an independent label,

660
00:44:01,788 --> 00:44:03,847
but it just... this last album...

661
00:44:03,923 --> 00:44:07,586
it just got to the point where that's
not gonna be viable for us anymore.

662
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,855
Everybody, it's Fletcher from Pennywise.

663
00:44:09,929 --> 00:44:12,227
I've been meaning to ask...
the new record,

664
00:44:12,298 --> 00:44:14,732
it's been put out on
Myspace for two weeks, right?

665
00:44:14,801 --> 00:44:18,464
You guys feel good about this new
chapter in the Pennywise history?

666
00:44:18,538 --> 00:44:23,237
I mean, yeah. Obviously we've been on Epitaph
for about 16 years or something like that.

667
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:25,470
It's probably the greatest
independent label in the world.

668
00:44:25,545 --> 00:44:30,039
Uh, like a family to us. And just can't
say anything but good things about Epitaph.

669
00:44:30,116 --> 00:44:33,745
But with the way the music industry's
been over the last couple of years,

670
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,187
and people not buying records anymore
and record stores closing,

671
00:44:37,256 --> 00:44:38,951
we just wanted to change it up
a little bit.

672
00:44:39,025 --> 00:44:42,153
I've never judged them for it
for one second, you know.

673
00:44:42,228 --> 00:44:46,460
I think a band... it's-it's difficult
to make a living as a musician.

674
00:44:46,532 --> 00:44:49,092
And a band's gotta do what they
gotta do to get paid out there.

675
00:44:49,168 --> 00:44:52,695
Something I read, put a lot of thought
into, that entity is owned by...

676
00:44:52,772 --> 00:44:56,003
<i>a huge, multinational conglomerate,</i>

677
00:44:56,075 --> 00:44:59,340
<i>which is probably the worst words
you can mention in the punk arena.</i>

678
00:44:59,412 --> 00:45:02,472
<i>Just the other day I went there
for the first time for a meeting...</i>

679
00:45:02,548 --> 00:45:06,075
<i>and walked into the lobby,
and literally the hairs on my back stood up.</i>

680
00:45:06,152 --> 00:45:08,518
<i>And I'm just like, "Oh, my God.
I'm in the monster. "</i>

681
00:45:08,588 --> 00:45:12,991
<i>I'm standing in the lobby of the monster,
and there's Fox News on the wall.</i>

682
00:45:14,727 --> 00:45:19,027
Well, at this point, everything with meaning
in this world better be prepared to be a brand.

683
00:45:19,098 --> 00:45:22,693
I always joke there's this place
called Hot Topic at malls.

684
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:26,671
<i>I always call it the big church
of the commodification of subculture.</i>

685
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:29,003
<i>Because it's where, like,</i>

686
00:45:29,075 --> 00:45:34,172
<i>every bizarre subculture
can be friends at the mall.</i>

687
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:37,410
<i>So you've got your, like,
Sex Pistols baby T's,</i>

688
00:45:37,483 --> 00:45:39,212
<i>you've got your anarchist's bracelets,</i>

689
00:45:39,285 --> 00:45:42,846
<i>your, like, little Goth chokers, you know,</i>

690
00:45:42,922 --> 00:45:47,256
<i>your Tim Burton ephemera, your Slip Knot,
your speed metal, your surfer, whatever.</i>

691
00:45:47,326 --> 00:45:49,351
<i>They're all friends.
They're cheap.</i>

692
00:45:49,428 --> 00:45:53,387
You know, this is corporate culture
eating everything that exists up.

693
00:45:53,466 --> 00:45:58,904
<i>#Let me take you to the herding ground #</i>

694
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:05,842
<i># Where all good men
are trampled down #</i>

695
00:46:07,613 --> 00:46:09,843
<i>#Just to settle a bet #</i>

696
00:46:09,916 --> 00:46:11,747
<i>The Pennywise deal that we did,</i>

697
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:14,514
we worked with Pennywise to
give their album away for free,

698
00:46:14,587 --> 00:46:19,286
and we found a sponsor to make sure that
Pennywise, um, was able to get paid for their art.

699
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:22,452
<i>Now what was the... what was
the rationale behind giving it away?</i>

700
00:46:22,528 --> 00:46:25,429
<i>We thought it would be a cool way
to give back to the fans.</i>

701
00:46:25,498 --> 00:46:27,591
<i>We figured if we...
if we don't sell any records,</i>

702
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:30,295
<i>then, uh, we'll be cool with
just getting some new fans.</i>

703
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:34,465
<i>#And there will be sorrow #</i>

704
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:38,977
<i>Some people compare the digital
revolution, the Web revolution...</i>

705
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:40,672
to the industrial revolution.

706
00:46:40,746 --> 00:46:43,579
It's really more significant
than that.

707
00:46:43,649 --> 00:46:46,117
<i>Stores are no longer necessary.</i>

708
00:46:46,185 --> 00:46:48,380
<i>Little shiny disks
are no longer necessary.</i>

709
00:46:48,454 --> 00:46:53,084
<i>The trucks that ship the content
back and forth are no longer necessary.</i>

710
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:55,457
<i>The warehouses are no longer necessary.</i>

711
00:46:55,528 --> 00:47:00,056
<i>And probably the record companies
themselves are no longer necessary.</i>

712
00:47:00,132 --> 00:47:06,799
<i># There will be sorrow no more #</i>

713
00:47:06,873 --> 00:47:10,309
<i>#No more ##</i>

714
00:47:12,011 --> 00:47:16,710
I think for some reason rock musicians
are judged on a much stricter standard...

715
00:47:16,782 --> 00:47:19,182
than anyone else in our society...
I have no idea why.

716
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:22,517
<i>You make one wrong turn, they call
you a sellout or something like that.</i>

717
00:47:22,588 --> 00:47:27,321
<i>You know, you sell an MP3 for 99 cents
and they think you're ripping someone off.</i>

718
00:47:27,393 --> 00:47:28,951
<i>You know, where they have no problem,</i>

719
00:47:29,028 --> 00:47:34,989
<i>you know, paying $3.99 for a crappy coffee at
Starbucks, and it's not even a free-trade product.</i>

720
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:39,629
<i>You know, it's like exploiting some...
some peasant in Nicaragua.</i>

721
00:47:39,705 --> 00:47:41,969
You know what I mean?
They'll go down there and chug it...

722
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:44,407
and then they'll fill up their car
with Shell Oil, right?

723
00:47:44,477 --> 00:47:48,004
And then they'll get mad at a band...

724
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:53,518
for being in a, uh... in a Nike commercial...
having their music in a Nike commercial...

725
00:47:53,586 --> 00:47:55,349
when they're fucking wearing Nikes.

726
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:57,855
Forget punk.
Just ask yourself as a person...

727
00:47:57,924 --> 00:48:02,418
Is it... How is one supposed to
operate ethically in this world...

728
00:48:02,495 --> 00:48:04,622
while at the same time pay your way?

729
00:48:04,697 --> 00:48:08,633
And the reality of having to make money
and keep your family supported...

730
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:12,034
<i>and then being home, there's this
huge kind of sacrifice on both ends.</i>

731
00:48:12,104 --> 00:48:15,335
<i>The wife and the husband
trying to figure out that balance.</i>

732
00:48:15,408 --> 00:48:19,367
What are we paying for?
What are these checks for?

733
00:48:19,445 --> 00:48:23,404
P.E. Clothes, yearbook, planner,

734
00:48:23,482 --> 00:48:27,509
P.T.A. Membership and foundation.

735
00:48:27,586 --> 00:48:29,918
P.E. Clothes?
Did I have to pay for P.E. Clothes?

736
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:31,479
<i>You know what?</i>

737
00:48:31,557 --> 00:48:36,722
I mean, Pennywise,
to make a living, have to work.

738
00:48:36,796 --> 00:48:39,526
<i>And Pennywise work means...</i>

739
00:48:39,598 --> 00:48:41,657
<i>getting up on stage...</i>

740
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:46,899
<i>and entertaining those who are willing
to pay money to see them do so.</i>

741
00:48:46,973 --> 00:48:50,101
They just got to learn to kick ass live,
that's what it's all about.

742
00:48:50,176 --> 00:48:53,043
You got to really know how to play music.

743
00:48:53,112 --> 00:48:57,446
Well, now what you may
have noticed is, uh, bands that,

744
00:48:57,516 --> 00:49:02,249
<i>you know, would tour once a year,
are now coming home once a year.</i>

745
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:05,154
Um, I'm sorry I have to
miss your thing tonight,

746
00:49:05,224 --> 00:49:07,954
but I want you to do
really good, okay? Okay.

747
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:15,232
Buckle up.

748
00:49:15,301 --> 00:49:17,633
<i>#All my bags are packed
and ready to go #</i>

749
00:49:17,703 --> 00:49:20,194
<i>#I'm standin'here outside the door #</i>

750
00:49:20,272 --> 00:49:25,300
<i>#I hate to wake you up to say good-bye # Okay,
everyone, be super good to Mom while I'm gone, right?</i>

751
00:49:25,378 --> 00:49:27,608
<i>#But the dawn is breakin'
It's early morn #</i>

752
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,240
<i># The taxi's waitin' He's
blowin'his horn # Love you.</i>

753
00:49:30,316 --> 00:49:34,844
<i>#Already I'm so lonesome I could die #</i>

754
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,048
<i># 'Cause I'm leavin'on a jet plane #</i>

755
00:49:38,124 --> 00:49:40,752
<i>#Don't know
when I'll be back again #</i>

756
00:49:40,826 --> 00:49:45,263
<i>#Oh, babe, I hate to go #</i>

757
00:49:46,766 --> 00:49:48,961
Then you have a good tour
and it's easy to keep going.

758
00:49:49,035 --> 00:49:53,802
I love everything about Pennywise... their
sound, their aggression on stage. Just everything.

759
00:49:53,873 --> 00:49:56,808
Pennywise is sick.
Pennywise is great.

760
00:49:56,876 --> 00:50:00,209
I just like the basic beat and, like,
the singer. I like everything about it.

761
00:50:00,279 --> 00:50:02,975
It's this sick, fast-paced punk band.

762
00:50:03,049 --> 00:50:06,541
Explosiveness, like when
they're singing on stage.

763
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:09,850
I mean, there's Black Flag, there's,
you know, all kinds of good stuff.

764
00:50:09,922 --> 00:50:11,685
But Pennywise will always,

765
00:50:11,757 --> 00:50:17,525
always be in the top category
of any punk rock bands, period.

766
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:21,491
<i># 'Cause I'm leavin'
on a jet plane #</i>

767
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,195
<i>#Don't know
when I'll be back again #</i>

768
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,261
<i>#Oh, babe, I hate to go #</i>

769
00:50:26,338 --> 00:50:27,999
<i>Right now I feel happy about it.</i>

770
00:50:28,074 --> 00:50:31,601
<i>I understand that we're goin'out there
to play music and do somethin'for our fans,</i>

771
00:50:31,677 --> 00:50:33,702
<i>and I think we're still
playing good music...</i>

772
00:50:33,779 --> 00:50:36,009
<i>and stoking our fans out,
which is what it's all about.</i>

773
00:50:36,082 --> 00:50:40,519
As long as we're doing that, I'll keep doing it...
well, for a little while longer.

774
00:50:40,653 --> 00:50:43,144
As long as they keep
their live show...

775
00:50:43,222 --> 00:50:46,851
as much fun
and as good as it is,

776
00:50:46,926 --> 00:50:48,951
I think, you know,

777
00:50:49,028 --> 00:50:51,997
no reason they can't go
another 10 or 20 years.

778
00:50:52,064 --> 00:50:54,760
<i>#Oh, kiss me and smile for me #</i>

779
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:56,893
<i># Tell me that you'll wait for me #</i>

780
00:50:56,969 --> 00:51:00,268
<i>#Hold me like you'll never let me #</i>

781
00:51:00,339 --> 00:51:02,170
<i># You'll never let me go #</i>

782
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:05,369
<i># 'Cause I'm leaving

783
00:51:05,444 --> 00:51:08,004
<i>#Don't know

784
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:12,881
<i>#Oh, babe, I hate to go ##</i>

785
00:51:12,952 --> 00:51:16,615
Well, I just checked in
to my hotel in, uh, Austria.

786
00:51:16,689 --> 00:51:18,350
- Bologna, Italy.
- Hamburg.

787
00:51:18,424 --> 00:51:19,686
- Milan.
- Sardinia.

788
00:51:19,758 --> 00:51:20,747
Landau, Germany.

789
00:51:24,196 --> 00:51:26,187
8:00 in the morning...

790
00:51:26,265 --> 00:51:29,098
on a flight back to Milan.

791
00:51:29,168 --> 00:51:32,228
Vocals shot, as usual.

792
00:51:33,372 --> 00:51:36,034
<i>#Hey, where have you gone? #</i>

793
00:51:36,108 --> 00:51:38,702
<i># You used to be the one #</i>

794
00:51:38,777 --> 00:51:40,711
<i># That we looked up to #</i>

795
00:51:41,847 --> 00:51:45,578
<i>#Seemed like nothing
could get you down #</i>

796
00:51:46,986 --> 00:51:49,011
<i>#How high was your price #</i>

797
00:51:49,088 --> 00:51:50,817
<i>#And was it worth it? #</i>

798
00:51:51,991 --> 00:51:53,652
Write an "R."

799
00:51:59,165 --> 00:52:01,133
<i>#From the start #</i>

800
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,498
<i>#In the end #</i>

801
00:52:03,569 --> 00:52:07,130
<i>#It's all a question ofheart #</i>

802
00:52:07,206 --> 00:52:09,504
<i>#Hey, where have you gone? #</i>

803
00:52:09,575 --> 00:52:13,841
<i># You used to be the one
that we looked up to #</i>

804
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:19,076
<i>#Seemed like nothing
could bring you down #</i>

805
00:52:19,151 --> 00:52:23,520
<i>#How high was the price
and was it worth it? #</i>

806
00:52:23,589 --> 00:52:27,753
Kids sense an intrinsic value
to a live performance.

807
00:52:27,826 --> 00:52:29,589
<i>It's something that they're part of.</i>

808
00:52:29,662 --> 00:52:32,495
<i>It's something that's only gonna happen
right then and there,</i>

809
00:52:32,565 --> 00:52:34,192
<i>for that moment,
and then it's gone.</i>

810
00:52:34,266 --> 00:52:36,427
<i>And so they put a value on it,</i>

811
00:52:36,502 --> 00:52:40,336
and that's one of the places
where artists can make money now.

812
00:52:40,406 --> 00:52:43,807
That's, like, maybe the main place
for most bands.

813
00:52:47,546 --> 00:52:49,776
<i>#Hey, where did it go? #</i>

814
00:52:49,848 --> 00:52:51,839
<i>#Everything we fought for #</i>

815
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:54,147
<i>#And everything it meant #</i>

816
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,680
<i>Touring is really something for people
that are in their 20s to do anyhow.</i>

817
00:52:58,757 --> 00:53:01,726
<i># Who I am, who I was #</i>

818
00:53:01,794 --> 00:53:04,262
<i># Who I wanna be ##</i>

819
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:07,891
<i>The idea of touring at my age...</i>

820
00:53:10,035 --> 00:53:12,526
is hard work.

821
00:53:12,605 --> 00:53:15,233
I'm not in a band
that's at a level...

822
00:53:15,307 --> 00:53:19,209
<i>that comfort is always... there.</i>

823
00:53:21,547 --> 00:53:24,482
As the bands get older, you know,

824
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,950
it's like,
"Boy, this isn't for me, you know.

825
00:53:27,019 --> 00:53:29,647
I want a hotel. "
They deserve it.

826
00:53:34,026 --> 00:53:36,187
But I'm still trying.

827
00:53:36,262 --> 00:53:38,594
Oh, yeah? What's the hotel?
The Econo Lodge.

828
00:53:38,664 --> 00:53:40,188
The Econo Lodge.

829
00:53:47,106 --> 00:53:49,700
<i>#Everyday I convince myself #</i>

830
00:53:49,775 --> 00:53:52,471
<i>#Of everything I can and can't believe #</i>

831
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:57,643
<i>#Abused, confused #</i>

832
00:53:59,818 --> 00:54:02,378
<i>#Everyday you get a little bit older #</i>

833
00:54:02,454 --> 00:54:05,855
<i>#And everything gets hard
You wonder why #</i>

834
00:54:05,924 --> 00:54:09,917
<i>#Afraid, deranged #</i>

835
00:54:12,064 --> 00:54:13,998
<i>#Hold on to your promise #</i>

836
00:54:14,066 --> 00:54:16,626
<i># You can use it for a crutch #</i>

837
00:54:18,337 --> 00:54:21,135
<i>It doesn't matter who the band is,
it's all Spinal Tap.</i>

838
00:54:21,206 --> 00:54:24,107
<i>Everybody... No matter what you say, you
know, you're playing the same kind of venues,</i>

839
00:54:24,176 --> 00:54:27,771
<i>and you have the same kind of crews
and the same kind of flights...</i>

840
00:54:27,846 --> 00:54:30,144
<i>and the same kind
ofbad hotel food...</i>

841
00:54:30,215 --> 00:54:32,080
<i>and bad hotel experiences.</i>

842
00:54:32,151 --> 00:54:34,642
Okay.
Let's see what we got here.

843
00:54:35,721 --> 00:54:38,019
We got a chicken sandwich,
but...

844
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:42,653
the bread has, like, weird pimentos.

845
00:54:42,728 --> 00:54:45,060
Oh, man!

846
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:49,796
What the hell is this?
Look at this stuff.

847
00:54:49,868 --> 00:54:52,462
This is what I'm talkin' about.
Like, what is that?

848
00:54:52,538 --> 00:54:54,438
I don't even know what that is.

849
00:54:54,506 --> 00:54:58,237
It looks like a huge,
flattened booger.

850
00:55:00,145 --> 00:55:01,942
I don't know what to do with that.

851
00:55:02,014 --> 00:55:05,814
<i>#Afraid, deranged #</i>

852
00:55:08,087 --> 00:55:10,612
<i>#Hold on to your promise #</i>

853
00:55:10,689 --> 00:55:13,317
<i>- # You can use it for a crutch #
- My earl</i>

854
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,955
<i>#Stand by while all your dreams
get trampled into dust ##</i>

855
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:20,965
This is the bunk area
where everyone sleeps.

856
00:55:21,033 --> 00:55:23,467
Usually when we're rollin' down the road,

857
00:55:23,535 --> 00:55:26,197
there's anywhere from 10 to 12 guys...

858
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:27,898
sleeping in here at once.

859
00:55:27,973 --> 00:55:31,500
So it smells like a combination...

860
00:55:31,577 --> 00:55:35,707
of ass, farts, feet...

861
00:55:35,781 --> 00:55:40,047
and, um, a hint of balls
in there too.

862
00:55:51,797 --> 00:55:54,527
I don't know where he is sometimes,

863
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,763
and I don't know where he is
right now.

864
00:55:59,905 --> 00:56:01,964
I think he's going to
lots of different places.

865
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,100
Yeah. Once he went to Texas.

866
00:56:24,163 --> 00:56:26,324
Stay on the bus.

867
00:56:31,336 --> 00:56:34,134
<i>Right now I'm starting to realize,</i>

868
00:56:34,206 --> 00:56:36,197
<i>like, I don't wanna
do it this way anymore.</i>

869
00:56:36,275 --> 00:56:38,436
<i>You know, I don't wanna
sell the band out...</i>

870
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:40,808
<i>at every possible opportunity.</i>

871
00:56:40,879 --> 00:56:45,509
<i>I wanna... I want to just play to our fans
at the place that we wanna play.</i>

872
00:56:45,584 --> 00:56:47,779
<i>I don't wanna do a bunch ofhype.</i>

873
00:56:47,853 --> 00:56:53,086
<i>I don't want to do all these things that people
think you have to do to make a band successful.</i>

874
00:56:53,158 --> 00:56:55,592
Oh, that's pretty bad.

875
00:56:59,198 --> 00:57:01,860
Oh, fuckin' right,
it's great to be here.

876
00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:07,669
<i>What happens to a lot of guys...
You get up there and you're just sarcastic.</i>

877
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:10,674
<i>"Hey, Chicago. How you doin'?
Who gives a fuck?</i>

878
00:57:10,742 --> 00:57:13,973
<i>All right. What's goin'on
today? How you feelin'?"</i>

879
00:57:14,046 --> 00:57:16,879
And then you're, like,
"I'm a dildo. I'm just...

880
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:19,440
I'm not the real thing, you know?

881
00:57:19,518 --> 00:57:21,452
I'm just up here. "

882
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,012
You know, insert "Milwaukee"
where "Chicago" was.

883
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:28,924
Oh, it's great to be here tonight.
Have I said that yet?

884
00:57:28,994 --> 00:57:31,690
I'm just being honest,
'cause a lot of guys won't tell you this.

885
00:57:31,763 --> 00:57:35,756
They'll go up there and be, like,
"No, the show last night was rockin'."

886
00:57:35,834 --> 00:57:38,132
But they won't tell you
they have hemorrhoids...

887
00:57:38,203 --> 00:57:42,037
<i>and their liver's fallin'apart because they
had to drink, you know, a pint of whiskey...</i>

888
00:57:42,107 --> 00:57:45,406
to get into their personality
for the show.

889
00:57:45,477 --> 00:57:47,968
And they're a frickin' mess, you know.

890
00:57:48,046 --> 00:57:51,106
Or they're like me...
They're on Ambien and, you know, hair dye.

891
00:57:58,423 --> 00:58:02,086
<i>In Japan I was so sick
from the night before...</i>

892
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,185
<i>because everyone wanted
to party with me.</i>

893
00:58:04,263 --> 00:58:06,322
I started feeling nauseous in the van.

894
00:58:06,398 --> 00:58:08,457
I was, like, "Oh, my God.
I feel nauseous, dude. "

895
00:58:08,534 --> 00:58:10,695
I was, like,
"I gotta puke. I gotta puke. "

896
00:58:10,769 --> 00:58:15,672
They opened up the fucking sliding door,
and the guy's holding me down.

897
00:58:15,741 --> 00:58:20,769
I'm throwing up out on the side
of the freeway, dude. Like...

898
00:58:20,846 --> 00:58:24,976
I saw Fletcher one time
throw up in the crowd one time.

899
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,951
Yeah, that's great.
I saw him go... He's all...

900
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,421
You know...
Throw-up flies out of his mouth, dude.

901
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:35,722
It turns out...
Like pictures like crazy of him.

902
00:58:35,794 --> 00:58:38,695
Throw-up coming right out of his mouth,
guitar in his hand, dude. He's, like...

903
00:58:38,764 --> 00:58:41,255
He's an artist.
He's a vomit artist.

904
00:58:43,602 --> 00:58:46,230
<i>When I'm on tour,
I'm drunk every day.</i>

905
00:58:46,305 --> 00:58:49,035
For sure. I will not play sober.

906
00:58:50,509 --> 00:58:54,240
And I'm not one of those guys
who has a couple drinks before a show.

907
00:58:54,313 --> 00:58:57,714
You know, I will have four
vodka drinks and maybe a Valium.

908
00:58:57,783 --> 00:58:59,978
Let's just get this one thing straight...

909
00:59:00,052 --> 00:59:02,612
MichaelJackson...
wow, he wrote some good songs,

910
00:59:02,688 --> 00:59:05,248
but he was a fucking child molester,
so fuck him.

911
00:59:06,992 --> 00:59:09,051
This song is for MichaelJackson...

912
00:59:09,127 --> 00:59:13,291
because this was actually
the theme song of Neverland.

913
00:59:13,365 --> 00:59:16,266
Here we go.
It's called "Fuck Da Kids. "

914
00:59:16,335 --> 00:59:19,168
# Fuck da kids, fuck da kids #

915
00:59:19,237 --> 00:59:21,967
# Fuck da kids, fuck, yeah, yeah ##

916
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,532
Every road guy, to me, is an actor.

917
00:59:25,611 --> 00:59:28,671
I mean, you have to make them think
that this song...

918
00:59:28,747 --> 00:59:31,648
you fucking hate now,
you hate playing it,

919
00:59:31,717 --> 00:59:34,117
<i>you don't even listen to it anymore,</i>

920
00:59:34,186 --> 00:59:36,051
<i>but you are playing it.</i>

921
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:39,955
<i>To this person,
it fucking means the world to them.</i>

922
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:43,188
He can't believe you're singing this
right in front of him,

923
00:59:43,261 --> 00:59:47,027
and it's his one night out
and your 900th night out.

924
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:49,363
You're looking at your watch.
"How you doin'?"

925
00:59:49,434 --> 00:59:51,095
I got three days left.

926
00:59:51,169 --> 00:59:54,297
# I named this Randy
With a can I am handy #

927
00:59:54,373 --> 00:59:57,206
#Watch what I can do
Fuck all of you ##

928
00:59:58,477 --> 01:00:01,878
If you're touring with your band,
the pettiness of traveling on the road...

929
01:00:01,947 --> 01:00:03,938
is ridiculous at times.

930
01:00:04,016 --> 01:00:07,076
# My name is Randy
I look likeJamie Foxx #

931
01:00:07,152 --> 01:00:10,144
Let me hear ya. # If you ask me what
I like, I'll tell you I like cocks #

932
01:00:10,222 --> 01:00:11,951
Okay. Here it is.

933
01:00:12,024 --> 01:00:15,255
# My name is Fletcher
and I am real big #

934
01:00:15,327 --> 01:00:18,990
# I cannot see my penis,
but I sure can find a fork #

935
01:00:23,101 --> 01:00:26,002
<i>The other guys, I mean,
especially Fletcher, man,</i>

936
01:00:26,071 --> 01:00:28,767
<i>he wants to just keep
doing this forever, you know.</i>

937
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,501
At least I don't have hemorrhoids.

938
01:00:30,575 --> 01:00:33,009
At least I don't come back from
the bathroom, fuckin' talkin' about,

939
01:00:33,078 --> 01:00:37,139
"Oh, my God. That outhouse... code red.
You don't wanna see what happened in there. "

940
01:00:38,216 --> 01:00:41,743
Well, at least
I don't pee in the sink.

941
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:44,414
Hey, the sink's a perfect height.
# Fletcher pees in the sink #

942
01:00:44,489 --> 01:00:46,320
Sink's a perfect height.
#What do you think? #

943
01:00:46,391 --> 01:00:48,882
Yeah. Big fuckin' deal.

944
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,794
I'm fuckin' drunk again.
Goddamn it.

945
01:00:52,864 --> 01:00:55,196
<i>Couple of the other guys in the band
don't have kids,</i>

946
01:00:55,267 --> 01:00:57,758
<i>and, um, you know,
they wanna keep going.</i>

947
01:00:57,836 --> 01:00:59,861
They wanna go out there and rage...

948
01:00:59,938 --> 01:01:02,498
and go out and party every night
and play shows.

949
01:01:02,574 --> 01:01:04,235
That's totally fine. That's great.

950
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:07,710
If you don't have kids to consider,
that's an easy decision.

951
01:01:07,779 --> 01:01:09,940
When you'reJimmy
from Pennywise,

952
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:13,849
<i>and you're drawing anywhere
from 1,500 to 5,000 kids,</i>

953
01:01:13,919 --> 01:01:18,720
and that's anywhere... not in the
state, country-slash-the world...

954
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:23,750
and you've got three other people that
are counting on you to keep it going,

955
01:01:23,829 --> 01:01:26,024
<i>no longer are you just like...
you're the singer.</i>

956
01:01:26,098 --> 01:01:29,192
Like you can't go, "Oh, yeah, dude.
Pennywise withoutJimmy, that's cool. "

957
01:01:29,267 --> 01:01:32,862
You know, it's like no one can
replace the singer. It doesn't work.

958
01:01:34,406 --> 01:01:37,898
This band was fuckin' built
on fuckin' backyard parties...

959
01:01:37,976 --> 01:01:39,910
and fuckin' Budweiser,

960
01:01:39,978 --> 01:01:42,310
and we're never gonna stop...

961
01:01:43,315 --> 01:01:45,249
until I have to get a liver transplant,

962
01:01:45,317 --> 01:01:48,878
and then I'm gonna fuckin' slow down
for, like, a couple weeks.

963
01:01:48,954 --> 01:01:52,412
Punk rock singers should be up there
bleeding and drunk...

964
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:54,755
<i>and, you know...
How we doin' up there?</i>

965
01:01:54,826 --> 01:01:56,521
<i>Off their tree every night.</i>

966
01:01:56,595 --> 01:01:58,256
<i>That's who they want you to be.</i>

967
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:01,026
<i>They want you to be the tragic figure...</i>

968
01:02:01,099 --> 01:02:03,590
<i>of Darby Crash or Sid Vicious...</i>

969
01:02:03,668 --> 01:02:06,000
<i>and, you know, get on heroin
and get drunk...</i>

970
01:02:06,071 --> 01:02:09,438
and play totally fucked up
and break bottles over your head.

971
01:02:09,508 --> 01:02:12,500
<i>Who wants to be that every day?
You'll be dead by the time you're 30.</i>

972
01:02:12,577 --> 01:02:15,307
It's like, you know,
you write a song when you're 18,

973
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:18,975
like "Fuck the world.
I'm gonna die before I get old. "

974
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:22,451
But then you get old,
and you don't wanna die.

975
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:24,921
Dyeing the goatee a little bit.

976
01:02:26,658 --> 01:02:29,456
Gettin' a little gray.
Don't wanna disappoint the kids,

977
01:02:30,462 --> 01:02:32,453
let 'em think I'm gettin' old.

978
01:02:33,598 --> 01:02:35,691
So,

979
01:02:35,767 --> 01:02:38,235
a little hair dye on the old beard.

980
01:02:39,437 --> 01:02:41,371
Look young again.

981
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:45,267
Don't tell anyone
I'm doin' it though.

982
01:02:46,545 --> 01:02:48,479
Don't want the secret to get out.

983
01:02:48,547 --> 01:02:51,880
We were going through the set for the
next Blink tour that starts this summer,

984
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:54,783
and, uh, there was
a couple songs that got cut...

985
01:02:54,853 --> 01:02:59,153
'cause I'm, like, "Look, I'm 37.
I'm not singin' about jerking off...

986
01:02:59,224 --> 01:03:02,091
Right now. "

987
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,991
Yeah, sometimes you feel
like a birthday clown.

988
01:03:04,062 --> 01:03:06,530
<i>There's definitely
that element in there.</i>

989
01:03:06,598 --> 01:03:10,090
<i>It's, like, "All right. These are
little kids, and you're entertaining 'em.</i>

990
01:03:11,503 --> 01:03:14,131
Why not make a balloon animal, you know?
They'd probably like that too. "

991
01:03:14,206 --> 01:03:16,766
Live fast, die, uh, a little bit older.

992
01:03:16,842 --> 01:03:22,178
I don't wear boots and go do random
acts of nihilistic destruction.

993
01:03:22,247 --> 01:03:24,738
<i>Even though
I thoroughly enjoyed doing so...</i>

994
01:03:24,816 --> 01:03:27,751
<i>as a teenager, right?</i>

995
01:03:27,819 --> 01:03:30,617
<i>I think that's probably
the right time to be doing it, you know.</i>

996
01:03:30,689 --> 01:03:32,987
If you do it at my age,
you're a terrorist.

997
01:03:33,124 --> 01:03:37,026
Here, let's play catch with that diaper
behind your head. There's a dirty diaper.

998
01:03:37,095 --> 01:03:40,496
Throw it to me. Come on!
Let's have some fun.

999
01:03:41,733 --> 01:03:44,429
<i>I've been touring a lot in the last
three years with Nine Inch Nails.</i>

1000
01:03:44,502 --> 01:03:46,231
It's tough finding the balance,

1001
01:03:46,304 --> 01:03:49,432
and I consciously work at that
because I work a lot.

1002
01:04:00,585 --> 01:04:03,179
What do you think's in there...
one or two?

1003
01:04:03,255 --> 01:04:05,917
Throw it, we'll figure it out.
You know, I think it's two actually.

1004
01:04:05,991 --> 01:04:07,982
Just go ahead,
throw it to me.

1005
01:04:08,059 --> 01:04:11,620
<i>#So fresh, so clean #
Whoa!</i>

1006
01:04:11,696 --> 01:04:15,154
I don't know. It's questionable.
It's kinda heavy.

1007
01:04:15,233 --> 01:04:17,701
Oh, gee! You gotta catch it.

1008
01:04:17,769 --> 01:04:20,260
This was his to begin with.
Here.

1009
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:22,602
Can you play catch?
Yeah.

1010
01:04:22,674 --> 01:04:25,905
This isn't even the most screwed-up part of the
whole thing, playing catch with a dirty diaper.

1011
01:04:25,977 --> 01:04:29,140
<i>As my oldest son gets older,
it's getting harder.</i>

1012
01:04:29,214 --> 01:04:31,205
You know, the more
he turns into his own person,

1013
01:04:31,283 --> 01:04:36,016
the more he and I have this bond
that continues to get stronger and stronger,

1014
01:04:36,087 --> 01:04:38,214
and he's turning
into a little boy,

1015
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:40,656
it's just tough being gone,
and now we've got this newborn.

1016
01:04:44,429 --> 01:04:46,090
Go!

1017
01:04:50,735 --> 01:04:52,066
Go, Augie.

1018
01:04:52,137 --> 01:04:55,072
It's the late-night phone calls where he's
sad, or asking me when I'm gonna come home.

1019
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,630
That's the worst part.

1020
01:04:57,676 --> 01:05:00,645
<i>The rate and the volume
that Nine Inch Nail's been touring,</i>

1021
01:05:00,712 --> 01:05:04,170
<i>I just couldn't keep up with it right now.
You know what I mean?</i>

1022
01:05:04,249 --> 01:05:05,807
Augie.

1023
01:05:05,884 --> 01:05:10,218
<i>You know, I left the band
strictly because of that.</i>

1024
01:05:10,288 --> 01:05:13,883
<i>Uh, because, uh,
I needed to be around more.</i>

1025
01:05:13,959 --> 01:05:15,893
Yeah, there's the "wa-wa. "

1026
01:05:16,895 --> 01:05:18,886
No, we're not walking
down to it though.

1027
01:05:18,964 --> 01:05:21,432
We can look at it
from across the street.

1028
01:05:21,499 --> 01:05:24,297
All right. We're running a little
bit late, okay, so let's keep going.

1029
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:26,360
All right. Jacket off.

1030
01:05:26,438 --> 01:05:29,669
I need to go to the bathroom. We'll get your
jacket off, and we'll go to the bathroom.

1031
01:05:29,741 --> 01:05:32,505
<i>My child is five years old.
I've never been home for a Halloween.</i>

1032
01:05:32,577 --> 01:05:35,045
<i>You know, I've never seen her
on Halloween day...</i>

1033
01:05:35,113 --> 01:05:36,774
<i>or with her trick-or-treating.</i>

1034
01:05:36,848 --> 01:05:41,285
It's little things like that... that sort of... that
are sad moments that you miss, that you sacrifice.

1035
01:05:41,353 --> 01:05:43,378
<i>That's the hard part for me,</i>

1036
01:05:43,455 --> 01:05:46,356
<i>is knowing that there's things
I wanna be present for.</i>

1037
01:05:46,424 --> 01:05:47,914
Okay, go jump in the car.

1038
01:05:47,993 --> 01:05:50,188
<i>I missed the first day of school
for my kid this year...</i>

1039
01:05:50,261 --> 01:05:53,424
<i>to go to Europe and do extra shows
that I didn't wanna play,</i>

1040
01:05:53,498 --> 01:05:57,400
<i>but the guys really wanted to do 'em
and thought they were important.</i>

1041
01:05:57,469 --> 01:06:00,632
<i>I hope my kids understand one day
that the reason I went on tour...</i>

1042
01:06:00,705 --> 01:06:02,832
<i>is so I can give them everything.</i>

1043
01:06:05,543 --> 01:06:08,239
Is that gonna... Oh, ballpoint
pen. Okay. You got it.

1044
01:06:08,313 --> 01:06:11,476
Should we go see if Brighton's
coming up the street yet?

1045
01:06:11,549 --> 01:06:15,781
It's only exactly 3:00, so I'd be
surprised if she made it home yet, but...

1046
01:06:24,929 --> 01:06:27,864
So how was the first day, you guys?
Good.

1047
01:06:27,932 --> 01:06:31,424
Was it fun? Did you guys
have a good time? Yeah.

1048
01:06:31,503 --> 01:06:34,495
Ready, get together.
One, two.

1049
01:06:34,572 --> 01:06:37,564
One more. One, two.
Emma, stop it.

1050
01:06:37,642 --> 01:06:39,872
Okay. One more.
One, two.

1051
01:06:39,944 --> 01:06:42,174
<i>Hello.</i>

1052
01:06:42,247 --> 01:06:44,238
Hi. We can't see you.
Yes.

1053
01:06:45,617 --> 01:06:49,075
<i>Can you see me?
Daddy! Lookit. There he is.</i>

1054
01:06:49,154 --> 01:06:50,883
<i>Hi!
I fixed it.</i>

1055
01:06:50,955 --> 01:06:52,616
<i># I am DEVO #
Are they there?</i>

1056
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:57,650
And Kelly was here, and we went
school shopping. # I am DEVO, hoo-hoo #

1057
01:06:57,729 --> 01:07:01,688
<i>Oh, you went school shopping with, uh, my
sister? Kelly. We went to go get supplies.</i>

1058
01:07:01,766 --> 01:07:03,427
<i>Uh-huh.
Where are you?</i>

1059
01:07:03,501 --> 01:07:05,435
<i>There you are.
How come you can see us?</i>

1060
01:07:05,503 --> 01:07:08,563
<i>I don't know. You just had me, and
now I'm gone. Uh-oh. Get yourself back.</i>

1061
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,200
<i>It's not quite the same unless
we can see you. I'll try.</i>

1062
01:07:11,276 --> 01:07:15,042
<i>Daddy, let me tell you
about my day, all righty?</i>

1063
01:07:15,113 --> 01:07:18,605
<i>Okay. How was it? Kate's trying to be
in front of me, so I'm gonna wait till...</i>

1064
01:07:18,683 --> 01:07:20,583
Good confetti.
Okay. Go ahead.

1065
01:07:20,652 --> 01:07:24,713
Okay, Dad. So do you want to hear
about my whole entire actual live day?

1066
01:07:24,789 --> 01:07:26,484
<i>Yeah. Let's hear it.</i>

1067
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:29,349
Dad?

1068
01:07:39,971 --> 01:07:43,964
<i>Growing up, my dad was a salesman
and had to wine and dine clients,</i>

1069
01:07:44,042 --> 01:07:45,976
<i>you know, after work.</i>

1070
01:07:46,044 --> 01:07:48,877
<i>And he missed out on baseball games
and stufflike that.</i>

1071
01:07:48,947 --> 01:07:51,848
I'll never forget this one game
that I pitched, and I got...

1072
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:53,941
I pitched a two-hitter
and we won the game.

1073
01:07:54,018 --> 01:07:57,181
<i>After the game, I, you know,
wanted my dad to be proud of me.</i>

1074
01:07:57,255 --> 01:08:00,952
<i>I came out, and he showed up
at the end of the game and missed it all.</i>

1075
01:08:01,025 --> 01:08:04,791
Even though I love my dad and stuff, I was,
"How could you miss that and not be there for me?

1076
01:08:04,863 --> 01:08:08,094
Like, that was such an important thing,
and I wanted you to be proud of me.

1077
01:08:08,166 --> 01:08:10,726
<i>I won the game,
and everyone cheered for me. "</i>

1078
01:08:10,802 --> 01:08:13,930
<i>Even though it was a long time ago,
it still sticks with me,</i>

1079
01:08:14,005 --> 01:08:16,405
and I don't want to do that
to my kid, you know.

1080
01:08:16,474 --> 01:08:19,102
It's, like, I don't want them
ever to be, like, "Where were you?"

1081
01:08:20,078 --> 01:08:22,410
When I had my daughter,

1082
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,677
that's when I started to
really get angry at my dad.

1083
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:33,054
<i>I didn't go to the park with my dad.
I never went to a game with my dad.</i>

1084
01:08:33,124 --> 01:08:34,785
<i>I never did anything with him.</i>

1085
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:39,296
<i>I was asking him about it. He was, like, "Yeah,
yeah. Your mom used to make me take you on weekends,</i>

1086
01:08:39,364 --> 01:08:42,197
you know, twice a month,
but I didn't want you around. "

1087
01:08:42,267 --> 01:08:47,603
And he would, uh... he would be at the pool
at his adults-only apartment building,

1088
01:08:47,672 --> 01:08:49,799
and I'd be inside, watching TV.

1089
01:08:52,043 --> 01:08:57,709
<i>I don't understand why they would
let me just roam the streets as a kid.</i>

1090
01:08:57,782 --> 01:09:00,842
When I was growing up,
came home from school,

1091
01:09:00,919 --> 01:09:03,888
and, you know,
when the streetlights come on,

1092
01:09:03,955 --> 01:09:06,048
<i>it's time to come home.</i>

1093
01:09:06,124 --> 01:09:08,183
So that's a solid, like,
three or four hours...

1094
01:09:08,259 --> 01:09:10,625
where they just had no clue
where I was or anything.

1095
01:09:10,695 --> 01:09:12,560
<i>That is wheels off.</i>

1096
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:16,623
<i>And they'd just drop us off at the park.
"All right. We'll come back in two hours.</i>

1097
01:09:16,701 --> 01:09:19,033
<i>You guys have fun. "</i>

1098
01:09:19,103 --> 01:09:20,968
<i>And that was normal.</i>

1099
01:09:21,973 --> 01:09:25,409
For the first 10 years of my life,
I was raised...

1100
01:09:25,476 --> 01:09:27,137
<i>from a single parent.</i>

1101
01:09:27,212 --> 01:09:29,271
<i>My mom was a single parent.</i>

1102
01:09:29,347 --> 01:09:31,440
<i>My dad left when I was real young.</i>

1103
01:09:31,516 --> 01:09:35,043
I had a stepdad who had a lot
of major substance abuse problems.

1104
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:39,351
My mom was a full-time worker
and didn't really have time...

1105
01:09:39,424 --> 01:09:41,358
and wouldn't know what I was doing.

1106
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,121
I once asked my dad...

1107
01:09:44,195 --> 01:09:47,460
what the difference between
a Republican and a Democrat is,

1108
01:09:47,532 --> 01:09:50,023
<i>and his answer was,
"We're Republicans, Son. "</i>

1109
01:09:52,503 --> 01:09:54,471
So I don't know if that tells you.

1110
01:09:54,539 --> 01:09:58,600
I just was not happy
with my family life.

1111
01:09:58,676 --> 01:10:00,473
I just didn't like my whole thing.

1112
01:10:00,545 --> 01:10:03,105
My mom was so overboard Christian,

1113
01:10:03,181 --> 01:10:05,843
<i>and my dad was a gun fanatic.</i>

1114
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:07,782
<i>He trashed my place.</i>

1115
01:10:07,852 --> 01:10:11,151
He ripped off my posters
and broke my records.

1116
01:10:11,222 --> 01:10:13,918
<i>And I ran away from home.</i>

1117
01:10:13,992 --> 01:10:16,552
My parents divorced at nine...

1118
01:10:16,628 --> 01:10:19,290
<i>when I was nine,
so I had to be dad.</i>

1119
01:10:19,364 --> 01:10:23,130
My father left
when I was four, five.

1120
01:10:23,201 --> 01:10:27,103
<i>You know, took that walk for the
cigarettes and didn't come back.</i>

1121
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:30,504
So we ended up on the welfare thing,
eatin' the welfare food...

1122
01:10:30,575 --> 01:10:33,806
Velveeta and the big cans
and all that shit.

1123
01:10:33,878 --> 01:10:36,972
The police would come and knock
on my window and sneak us out...

1124
01:10:37,048 --> 01:10:40,950
<i>because my stepfather was in
another part of the house with a gun,</i>

1125
01:10:41,019 --> 01:10:42,782
<i>threatening to shoot
everybody in the house.</i>

1126
01:10:45,857 --> 01:10:48,348
But it's made me
want to be a better dad.

1127
01:10:48,426 --> 01:10:51,452
I try to catch myself
when I see my dad coming through.

1128
01:10:51,529 --> 01:10:54,794
I learned something about my father...

1129
01:10:54,866 --> 01:10:57,926
and every other man
that's walked out on their kids.

1130
01:10:58,002 --> 01:11:01,563
I learned that there are some people
in the world that don't deserve children,

1131
01:11:01,639 --> 01:11:05,268
and, um, that they really don't
deserve them.

1132
01:11:05,343 --> 01:11:08,471
I mean, because my parents
just didn't really do it.

1133
01:11:08,546 --> 01:11:12,243
They weren't really present,
and, you know,

1134
01:11:12,317 --> 01:11:14,717
um,

1135
01:11:14,786 --> 01:11:18,119
I don't think that they were really
focused on the job at hand.

1136
01:11:18,189 --> 01:11:20,919
I don't think that they knew,
you know?

1137
01:11:20,992 --> 01:11:25,053
And I just, like, for me,
I saw this little girl that I loved so much,

1138
01:11:25,129 --> 01:11:30,089
and I wanted to be there for her
at all times and to be there...

1139
01:11:30,168 --> 01:11:32,898
You know, when she was real young,
like, I stopped doing everything.

1140
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:35,131
I stopped drugs, and I stopped drinking.

1141
01:11:35,206 --> 01:11:38,767
I stopped smoking weed.
It was, like, "I'm gonna be here for you. "

1142
01:11:38,843 --> 01:11:41,437
And whether I'm
on the other side of the world,

1143
01:11:41,512 --> 01:11:44,310
when you talk to me on the phone,
I'm gonna be present, you know?"

1144
01:11:44,382 --> 01:11:45,872
And, like...

1145
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:51,050
That's what parents
are supposed to do, you know.

1146
01:11:51,122 --> 01:11:54,614
So I guess it's like I feel sad
because I just feel like, you know,

1147
01:11:54,692 --> 01:11:56,853
that my parents...
it's kind of sad to me...

1148
01:11:56,928 --> 01:12:00,056
'cause they just never understood that.

1149
01:12:02,767 --> 01:12:05,065
# Father of mine #

1150
01:12:05,136 --> 01:12:07,969
#Tell me where have you been #

1151
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:10,667
#Just close my eyes #

1152
01:12:10,742 --> 01:12:13,973
# My whole world disappeared #

1153
01:12:14,045 --> 01:12:16,172
<i>I just remember being
a really sweet boy...</i>

1154
01:12:16,247 --> 01:12:19,808
that wanted everybody
to just behave.

1155
01:12:19,884 --> 01:12:24,048
I wanted my daddy would be my daddy
and my mama to be my mom.

1156
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:28,718
<i>And when I was six,
my dad split to Florida.</i>

1157
01:12:28,793 --> 01:12:30,454
He didn't pay child support.

1158
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:37,430
# Father of mine #

1159
01:12:37,502 --> 01:12:40,164
#Take me back to the day #

1160
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:42,570
#Yeah, when I was still
your golden boy #

1161
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,904
# Back before you went away #

1162
01:12:44,976 --> 01:12:47,911
# I was 10 years old #

1163
01:12:47,979 --> 01:12:51,142
<i>#Doing all that I could #</i>

1164
01:12:51,215 --> 01:12:53,877
#Wasn't easy for me
to be a scared white boy #

1165
01:12:53,951 --> 01:12:56,419
# In a black neighborhood #

1166
01:12:57,989 --> 01:13:03,655
I was... I was abused. I was sexually
raped by older boys in the neighborhood...

1167
01:13:03,728 --> 01:13:05,719
when I was living
in the projects.

1168
01:13:07,999 --> 01:13:10,365
<i>#Never be safe #</i>

1169
01:13:10,435 --> 01:13:13,233
# I will never be sane #

1170
01:13:13,304 --> 01:13:16,137
# I will always be weird inside #

1171
01:13:16,207 --> 01:13:18,801
# I will always be lame #

1172
01:13:18,876 --> 01:13:21,106
One of the things
of the therapy I'm in right now,

1173
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:24,512
I'm dealing with a lot of the trauma
that happened to me as a kid,

1174
01:13:24,582 --> 01:13:26,675
as I go back as an adult...

1175
01:13:26,751 --> 01:13:29,242
and comfort me as a child.

1176
01:13:30,354 --> 01:13:32,618
# Father of mine #

1177
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:35,488
#Tell me how do you sleep #

1178
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,290
#With the children you abandoned #

1179
01:13:38,362 --> 01:13:41,331
#And the wife I saw you beat #

1180
01:13:41,399 --> 01:13:45,096
When my daughter Anna was born,
I remember...

1181
01:13:45,169 --> 01:13:48,696
<i>she was born in the early afternoon.</i>

1182
01:13:48,773 --> 01:13:51,207
I remember sitting down
on the couch...

1183
01:13:51,275 --> 01:13:52,867
in our apartment...

1184
01:13:52,944 --> 01:13:55,879
and feeling this weight,
physical weight on me,

1185
01:13:55,947 --> 01:13:58,780
<i>like I had never felt.</i>

1186
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:03,651
<i>It just felt like an elephant
was sitting on my chest.</i>

1187
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:07,350
I had no idea how to do this.
I can barely take care of myself.

1188
01:14:08,459 --> 01:14:10,893
<i>#I'm a grown man #</i>

1189
01:14:10,962 --> 01:14:13,522
<i># With a child of my own #</i>

1190
01:14:13,598 --> 01:14:16,658
<i>#And I'll swear
I'm not gonna let her know #</i>

1191
01:14:16,734 --> 01:14:19,567
#All the pain I have known #

1192
01:14:21,973 --> 01:14:24,942
# Daddy gave me a name #

1193
01:14:27,612 --> 01:14:30,843
<i>#Daddy gave me a name #</i>

1194
01:14:30,915 --> 01:14:33,349
<i># Then he walked away #</i>

1195
01:14:33,417 --> 01:14:36,409
<i>#Daddy gave me a name #</i>

1196
01:14:36,487 --> 01:14:38,978
<i># Then he walked away #</i>

1197
01:14:39,056 --> 01:14:42,184
<i>#Daddy gave me his name #</i>

1198
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:44,660
#Then he walked away #

1199
01:14:44,729 --> 01:14:47,425
#Then he walked away #

1200
01:14:47,498 --> 01:14:49,591
#Then he walked away, yeah ##

1201
01:15:01,612 --> 01:15:05,946
Okay, I'm gonna go outside and work.
You wanna work on the tomatoes?

1202
01:15:06,017 --> 01:15:07,917
Plant that stuff?
I am.

1203
01:15:07,985 --> 01:15:10,044
Dari, you wanna help me?
No? All right.

1204
01:15:10,121 --> 01:15:12,146
Come on, Nico. Let's do it.

1205
01:15:12,223 --> 01:15:15,454
You got the directions?
Do you have the seeds?

1206
01:15:17,628 --> 01:15:19,562
Let's do these over here.

1207
01:15:22,133 --> 01:15:25,296
We're gonna test natural selection
is what we're gonna do.

1208
01:15:25,369 --> 01:15:29,271
Then we'll have to pull out the strong...
keep the stronger ones.

1209
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:31,831
'Cause those are gonna be the ones
that'll make the tomatoes.

1210
01:15:31,909 --> 01:15:35,811
It's really hard growing something from a seed.
I'll be impressed if this actually happens.

1211
01:15:38,983 --> 01:15:42,248
<i>When Mary and I got married,
we wanted to have children.</i>

1212
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,050
<i>That was in the plan.</i>

1213
01:15:45,122 --> 01:15:48,091
And the pregnancy
went really well.

1214
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:52,960
But then something went wrong,
and she had a stillbirth.

1215
01:15:53,798 --> 01:15:57,029
<i>And, um, I said,
"Can I see the baby?</i>

1216
01:15:57,101 --> 01:16:00,434
<i>You know, bring me the baby. "</i>

1217
01:16:00,504 --> 01:16:04,065
They'd wrapped her up and sat and let
me hold her and let me sit with her.

1218
01:16:04,141 --> 01:16:07,235
I talked to her
and read her a story.

1219
01:16:07,311 --> 01:16:10,439
Just... Just tried not to lose my mind.

1220
01:16:10,514 --> 01:16:14,974
<i>So I can still see that baby.
I can still see Anabella, you know.</i>

1221
01:16:15,052 --> 01:16:17,714
<i>I can still see her face.</i>

1222
01:16:17,788 --> 01:16:20,188
<i>She looked just like her mother.</i>

1223
01:16:21,626 --> 01:16:23,890
These kids need you, man.

1224
01:16:23,961 --> 01:16:26,828
"Cat's in the Cradle" is so real.

1225
01:16:26,897 --> 01:16:29,024
You know, that song?

1226
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:32,592
<i>You know, promisin'the kid,
"And we'll get together then, Son. "</i>

1227
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:34,604
<i>You know,
"We'll have a good time then. "</i>

1228
01:16:34,672 --> 01:16:38,369
That's him when he was young,

1229
01:16:38,442 --> 01:16:41,309
him and his brother sleepin', you know.

1230
01:16:42,213 --> 01:16:45,114
Just stuff... a lot of stuff
when I wasn't there,

1231
01:16:45,182 --> 01:16:46,843
like what he was doin'.

1232
01:16:46,917 --> 01:16:49,181
Those were his shoes
he was wearin',

1233
01:16:49,253 --> 01:16:51,084
his last cup.

1234
01:16:51,155 --> 01:16:55,353
This is his little thing
when he was nine.

1235
01:16:55,426 --> 01:16:57,087
That was him.

1236
01:16:57,161 --> 01:17:00,255
He just got this, his first tattoo.
"Peters. "

1237
01:17:00,331 --> 01:17:03,823
So all the nephews and brother...

1238
01:17:03,901 --> 01:17:06,392
and everybody's got...
I even got one.

1239
01:17:08,139 --> 01:17:09,970
Can you see it?

1240
01:17:22,053 --> 01:17:25,386
<i>#My son, you're gone #</i>

1241
01:17:25,456 --> 01:17:27,924
<i>#Had a little fun #</i>

1242
01:17:27,992 --> 01:17:32,088
<i>#Good-bye
My God, I'm numb #</i>

1243
01:17:32,163 --> 01:17:34,461
<i>#Now you're gone #</i>

1244
01:17:34,532 --> 01:17:39,492
My kid was comin' down a street
that was just about to get on to the freeway.

1245
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:44,064
This guy couldn't wait, and he went to
make a left right in front of my son,

1246
01:17:44,141 --> 01:17:46,939
and my son, in front,
instead of hittin' him,

1247
01:17:47,011 --> 01:17:48,740
tried to... he veered.

1248
01:17:48,813 --> 01:17:51,281
<i>He didn't go to the hospital or nothin'.</i>

1249
01:17:51,348 --> 01:17:55,250
He was in the worst car crash
the towing company had seen in 10 years.

1250
01:17:55,319 --> 01:17:58,220
The car was split in two,
wrapped around a pole.

1251
01:17:58,289 --> 01:18:00,223
<i>They had to take two trucks to...</i>

1252
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:02,122
<i>He was killed instantly.</i>

1253
01:18:02,193 --> 01:18:05,128
It was just so gnarly.
It was, like, where was he?

1254
01:18:05,196 --> 01:18:07,790
<i>It was so gnarly in this thing.</i>

1255
01:18:07,865 --> 01:18:11,357
<i>#My boy, I see you smile #</i>

1256
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:17,332
<i>#Can feel you right beside me #</i>

1257
01:18:17,408 --> 01:18:20,172
<i>#My sweet child #</i>

1258
01:18:21,746 --> 01:18:24,408
<i>#I miss the games #</i>

1259
01:18:24,482 --> 01:18:27,883
<i>#I miss the school plays ##</i>

1260
01:18:29,086 --> 01:18:31,020
My first parental instinct...

1261
01:18:31,088 --> 01:18:34,216
when I heard my kid was killed...

1262
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:36,851
Ah, got an answer. Got a gun.

1263
01:18:36,927 --> 01:18:40,488
Running to the gun.
Half-ass suicide.

1264
01:18:40,564 --> 01:18:43,556
Aaah. Do I really wanna...
blah, blah, blah.

1265
01:18:43,634 --> 01:18:45,966
Whoa, it's kinda gnarly.

1266
01:18:46,036 --> 01:18:48,266
Blah, blah, blah.
This was the answer.

1267
01:18:48,339 --> 01:18:51,797
My kid needs a jacket.

1268
01:18:51,876 --> 01:18:55,368
Uh, warm... somethin' to eat.

1269
01:18:55,446 --> 01:18:57,277
You know what I mean?

1270
01:18:57,348 --> 01:18:59,077
This is a gnarly trip.

1271
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:02,608
I gotta go find him
before he gets too far away.

1272
01:19:02,686 --> 01:19:05,154
And I was just running
to go get my gun.

1273
01:19:05,222 --> 01:19:07,622
I was almost happy, kind of,

1274
01:19:07,691 --> 01:19:10,854
and there was not gonna
be any hesitation.

1275
01:19:10,928 --> 01:19:14,159
And in a matter of a second,

1276
01:19:14,231 --> 01:19:17,257
my, uh, other two boys came up,

1277
01:19:17,334 --> 01:19:21,236
and I got so fuckin' bummed,
I collapsed...

1278
01:19:21,305 --> 01:19:24,297
and totally seized up and shit.

1279
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:26,809
So I couldn't go nowhere.

1280
01:19:26,877 --> 01:19:29,971
You know? I can't go nowhere.

1281
01:19:34,885 --> 01:19:37,115
<i>We've been through a lot,</i>

1282
01:19:37,188 --> 01:19:41,215
and, uh, this is the most important job
a person can have...

1283
01:19:41,292 --> 01:19:43,283
is that of a parent.

1284
01:19:44,495 --> 01:19:48,158
And anybody who's lucky enough
to have children needs to understand that.

1285
01:19:48,232 --> 01:19:50,359
This has to be everything.

1286
01:19:56,473 --> 01:20:00,170
<i>It's funny, you always hear about
people saying, like, uh...</i>

1287
01:20:00,244 --> 01:20:03,042
That thing, the classic parent attitude
of, like, to a kid,

1288
01:20:03,113 --> 01:20:06,674
like, "I brought you into this world!
I gave you life, you know!"

1289
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,684
Like, I think completely opposite.

1290
01:20:08,752 --> 01:20:11,653
<i>Like, my kids gave me life.
You know?</i>

1291
01:20:11,722 --> 01:20:13,713
<i>They gave me a reason.</i>

1292
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:44,114
<i>To become a real parent,
whether you're a father or a mother,</i>

1293
01:20:44,188 --> 01:20:49,023
you have to... there has to be
this almost physiological change,

1294
01:20:49,093 --> 01:20:52,824
definitely a psychological
and spiritual change.

1295
01:20:52,897 --> 01:20:56,833
There's a... There's a couple of kids
in the back of that wagon.

1296
01:20:56,901 --> 01:20:59,768
The baby in the back... that's mine.

1297
01:21:00,971 --> 01:21:02,632
This is Arizona.

1298
01:21:06,343 --> 01:21:08,004
Mmm.

1299
01:21:08,078 --> 01:21:12,071
<i>The transition that I was talking about,
I think once it happened for one child,</i>

1300
01:21:12,149 --> 01:21:16,085
<i>it was kinda in for,
not just any other child I have,</i>

1301
01:21:16,153 --> 01:21:18,621
<i>but for any child I ever see.</i>

1302
01:21:18,689 --> 01:21:22,181
I'm the kind of person, that if a
kid's running loose at the airport,

1303
01:21:22,259 --> 01:21:23,988
I'll pick 'em up.

1304
01:21:24,061 --> 01:21:26,757
Of course I'm sure I've freaked
a lot of parents out.

1305
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:29,060
You know, "Where's my baby?

1306
01:21:29,133 --> 01:21:32,899
Oh, that blond man with the tattoos
and earrings is carrying her.

1307
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:34,961
Oh, that's... that's cool.

1308
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:36,768
That's kind of scary. "

1309
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:41,140
But I think once they meet me
and they see the way I hold a baby,

1310
01:21:41,211 --> 01:21:44,476
they know that I'm a dad
because kids know that I'm a dad.

1311
01:21:45,516 --> 01:21:49,008
<i>I want to be present for my children,
mentally and physically,</i>

1312
01:21:49,086 --> 01:21:53,250
and being gone all the time
just doesn't work into that.

1313
01:21:53,324 --> 01:21:55,485
What, what, what,
what, what, what?

1314
01:21:55,559 --> 01:21:59,359
Being home for a day or two
here and there...

1315
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:02,593
really doesn't give you
that bonding that you need.

1316
01:22:02,666 --> 01:22:05,692
<i>Being a parent is such
an indescribable thing...</i>

1317
01:22:05,769 --> 01:22:09,603
<i>that when you talk to people...
friends who don't have kids...</i>

1318
01:22:09,673 --> 01:22:14,167
and are maybe thinking about it or maybe,
like, a friend whose wife is pregnant,

1319
01:22:14,244 --> 01:22:16,405
<i>they're, like, "Oh, man, what's coming?
What's gonna happen?"</i>

1320
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:20,314
<i>And you're, like, "I'm gonna tell you this. It's
gonna change every single thing in your entire world,</i>

1321
01:22:20,384 --> 01:22:25,515
and I tell you that right now, but it'll
be 10 times that when it actually happens. "

1322
01:22:25,589 --> 01:22:28,558
It just really is like, uh...

1323
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:31,253
<i>It's like red matter
from Star Trek, you know?</i>

1324
01:22:31,328 --> 01:22:35,094
It just sucks everything in, and
your whole world just becomes...

1325
01:22:35,165 --> 01:22:36,826
this right here,

1326
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,164
and it's the most
amazing thing ever.

1327
01:22:40,738 --> 01:22:44,469
My family comes first,
regardless of anything,

1328
01:22:44,541 --> 01:22:46,702
and that's the beautiful thing
about Rancid...

1329
01:22:46,777 --> 01:22:50,269
is that, like, me and Matt
both have kids.

1330
01:22:50,347 --> 01:22:53,339
I'm real lucky 'cause I've got guys
that I work with are super-involved...

1331
01:22:53,417 --> 01:22:57,581
and super, um...

1332
01:22:57,654 --> 01:22:59,884
I mean, they get it.
They understand.

1333
01:22:59,957 --> 01:23:01,891
<i>They love those kids too.</i>

1334
01:23:01,959 --> 01:23:04,427
<i>So I've been really lucky with that.</i>

1335
01:23:04,495 --> 01:23:06,486
Okay, give me your foot.

1336
01:23:15,873 --> 01:23:24,042
<i>#Happy birthday to you #</i>

1337
01:23:24,114 --> 01:23:26,105
<i>I love you.
I love you.</i>

1338
01:23:27,351 --> 01:23:29,285
Thank you very much, girls.

1339
01:23:29,353 --> 01:23:31,480
<i>Daddy, guess what?
What?</i>

1340
01:23:31,555 --> 01:23:35,548
<i>You get to a certain point in your life...
What have I done and where am I going?</i>

1341
01:23:35,626 --> 01:23:38,857
<i>And I think guys, girls, women, men...</i>

1342
01:23:38,929 --> 01:23:41,420
<i>They end up going through it
at this time, you start saying,</i>

1343
01:23:41,498 --> 01:23:45,628
<i>"Do I like who I am, and do I want to
continue being this person?"</i>

1344
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:49,739
<i>What I'm getting at is,
this is a midlife crisis.</i>

1345
01:23:49,807 --> 01:23:52,640
<i>You know, spelled out in a band.</i>

1346
01:24:02,753 --> 01:24:05,381
<i>- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, kiddo. What are you doin'?</i>

1347
01:24:06,857 --> 01:24:10,987
<i>Dad, I did my guitar
every day.</i>

1348
01:24:11,061 --> 01:24:12,995
You practiced your guitar
every day?

1349
01:24:13,063 --> 01:24:15,827
<i>Yup.
Every day?</i>

1350
01:24:15,899 --> 01:24:17,457
<i>Yeah.
Even today?</i>

1351
01:24:18,836 --> 01:24:20,929
<i>Yeah.
Yeah?</i>

1352
01:24:21,004 --> 01:24:23,336
Awesome, B.
I'm so proud of you.

1353
01:24:35,018 --> 01:24:36,849
#Am I loud and clear #

1354
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,115
# Or am I breakin' up #

1355
01:24:39,189 --> 01:24:42,158
<i>You look out the window,
and you have a lot of time...</i>

1356
01:24:42,226 --> 01:24:45,787
of thinking about your family
and your kids getting older.

1357
01:24:45,863 --> 01:24:50,357
# Or are we just getting more lost #

1358
01:24:50,434 --> 01:24:54,131
<i>Then all of a sudden you find yourself...
the years start going by quicker,</i>

1359
01:24:54,204 --> 01:24:57,571
and you need to find
how you get off the road.

1360
01:24:58,308 --> 01:25:02,938
<i>I moved some dates around,
so I'm flying home from Texas...</i>

1361
01:25:03,013 --> 01:25:04,981
<i>for the father-daughter dance.</i>

1362
01:25:05,048 --> 01:25:06,982
<i>But the band doesn't know that.</i>

1363
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:10,281
<i>I'm sure when they find out why I switched
the shows, they're all gonna be pissed.</i>

1364
01:25:10,354 --> 01:25:14,518
<i># We live on front porches
and swing life away #</i>

1365
01:25:14,591 --> 01:25:19,119
<i># We get by just fine here
on minimum wage #</i>

1366
01:25:19,196 --> 01:25:22,632
<i>My middle daughter has never had
just me alone for the father-daughter dance.</i>

1367
01:25:22,699 --> 01:25:25,065
<i>She's always had to share me
with her older sister.</i>

1368
01:25:25,135 --> 01:25:28,036
<i>And I have to go to the dance
and dance with two of'em at once.</i>

1369
01:25:29,173 --> 01:25:31,334
Beautiful.

1370
01:25:32,342 --> 01:25:37,507
<i>My middle daughter definitely likes
having just me and just my attention,</i>

1371
01:25:37,581 --> 01:25:40,516
<i>so this is the one year
that she will have that.</i>

1372
01:25:40,584 --> 01:25:44,987
<i># We live on front porches
and swing life away #</i>

1373
01:25:45,055 --> 01:25:49,890
<i># We get by just fine here
on minimum wage #</i>

1374
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:53,691
<i>#Iflove is a labor,
I'll slave till the end #</i>

1375
01:25:53,764 --> 01:25:59,430
<i>#I won't cross these streets
until you hold my hand #</i>

1376
01:26:00,604 --> 01:26:03,664
<i>#Swing life away #</i>

1377
01:26:04,908 --> 01:26:08,071
<i>#Swing life away #</i>

1378
01:26:09,413 --> 01:26:13,873
<i>#Swing life away ##</i>

1379
01:26:13,951 --> 01:26:17,546
I'm willing to piss everyone off
to make my daughter happy.

1380
01:26:37,307 --> 01:26:40,276
<i>The other day I get a five-page letter
from the band...</i>

1381
01:26:40,344 --> 01:26:43,142
saying that I don't appreciate
what we have...

1382
01:26:43,213 --> 01:26:46,671
and, you know, basically, that I'm an
asshole because I won't tour enough...

1383
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:50,151
<i>and won't tour as much
as they want, you know.</i>

1384
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:53,280
<i>I feel like this year
I've toured twice as much.</i>

1385
01:26:55,759 --> 01:27:00,958
Just looks like every other downtown city I've
been in in the last frickin' month and a half.

1386
01:27:01,965 --> 01:27:06,265
<i>I added it up...
We did, like, 115 shows this year.</i>

1387
01:27:06,336 --> 01:27:08,770
<i>I'm definitely burnt out
from playing shows...</i>

1388
01:27:08,839 --> 01:27:10,397
<i>and just need a little break.</i>

1389
01:27:10,474 --> 01:27:12,135
Fuck.
# I need a Red Bull #

1390
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:16,104
<i>This isn't something
that has a lot of precedent.</i>

1391
01:27:16,179 --> 01:27:18,773
<i>If you're a big rock star,
you know, it's no question.</i>

1392
01:27:18,849 --> 01:27:21,010
<i>You go on tour,
you make millions of dollars.</i>

1393
01:27:21,084 --> 01:27:26,420
<i>And then if you're a small band, people know that
you can't continue to do it past a certain age.</i>

1394
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:32,351
I'm, uh... You have a list
for Club Nokia?

1395
01:27:32,429 --> 01:27:35,227
<i>When you're right in the middle
like this, it's kind of difficult.</i>

1396
01:27:35,299 --> 01:27:38,757
Last name: Lindberg.
L- I-N-D-B-E-R-G.

1397
01:27:40,904 --> 01:27:43,429
Do you have Fletcher Dragge, Byron...

1398
01:27:43,507 --> 01:27:44,997
Lindberg.

1399
01:27:45,075 --> 01:27:46,372
James orJim.

1400
01:27:46,443 --> 01:27:48,434
Yeah. Yeah.

1401
01:27:51,782 --> 01:27:55,445
<i>Motherfucking Pennywisel</i>

1402
01:28:06,296 --> 01:28:09,697
Los Angeles, we are Pennywise
from Hermosa Beach.

1403
01:28:09,766 --> 01:28:12,030
How you doin'?

1404
01:28:12,102 --> 01:28:13,763
Whoo-hoo!

1405
01:28:16,006 --> 01:28:17,997
Are you ready?

1406
01:28:20,377 --> 01:28:22,368
Let's do this shit.

1407
01:28:28,418 --> 01:28:31,910
All right.
Let me hear you scream!

1408
01:28:33,490 --> 01:28:35,151
<i>We got to see the world.</i>

1409
01:28:35,225 --> 01:28:37,887
<i>We made a lot of great fans,
and we had a good time doing it.</i>

1410
01:28:37,961 --> 01:28:40,930
<i>But I'm up there trying to be a good
lead singer of a band... Are you ready?</i>

1411
01:28:40,997 --> 01:28:42,988
<i>And a good dad at the same time.
Are you ready?</i>

1412
01:28:43,066 --> 01:28:46,729
<i>And you start to worry
if you're doing a bad job at both.</i>

1413
01:28:46,803 --> 01:28:48,464
Oh, shit.

1414
01:28:49,339 --> 01:28:50,829
Oh, thank God.
Are you ready?

1415
01:28:50,907 --> 01:28:53,569
I have, you know, been in places
where there's that fan...

1416
01:28:53,643 --> 01:28:56,476
and the adulation and stuff
like that, and it's huge.

1417
01:28:56,546 --> 01:29:00,312
You know what? I got an ego just like
anyone else, and I like that. It feels good.

1418
01:29:11,061 --> 01:29:14,155
But you know what? Still, you know,
you come home, and... "Hey, Dad. "

1419
01:29:15,232 --> 01:29:18,565
<i>I got a house full of teenagers,
and they're still here,</i>

1420
01:29:18,635 --> 01:29:21,297
<i>and they haven't moved out.</i>

1421
01:29:21,371 --> 01:29:24,772
And, you know, to me,
that's just the crown... for me.

1422
01:29:24,841 --> 01:29:26,638
I just love that.
That's awesome.

1423
01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:29,941
Growing up here in Hermosa Beach,
I learned from bands like Black Flag...

1424
01:29:30,013 --> 01:29:32,072
and the CircleJerks
and the Descendents.

1425
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:34,743
<i>You don't have to kill yourself,
you know,</i>

1426
01:29:34,818 --> 01:29:37,651
<i>playing a different show every night
for months and months and months.</i>

1427
01:29:37,721 --> 01:29:40,747
<i>You do it as much as you can
and still live your life and be happy.</i>

1428
01:29:40,824 --> 01:29:42,815
We got one more song.

1429
01:29:46,229 --> 01:29:48,390
Before this song happens,

1430
01:29:48,465 --> 01:29:50,729
I'm gonna invite
fuckin' our band up here.

1431
01:29:50,801 --> 01:29:54,259
This has never happened in the fuckin'
history 'cause it's kind of fuckin' gay,

1432
01:29:54,337 --> 01:29:56,305
but we're doin'
a group hug up here.

1433
01:29:56,373 --> 01:29:59,831
Randy, get your ass over here.
Byron, get your ass out here.

1434
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:02,208
Don't make me drag you
from behind that kit.

1435
01:30:02,279 --> 01:30:05,043
What? Group hug.

1436
01:30:05,115 --> 01:30:07,913
I don't know what.
Byron, come here.

1437
01:30:07,984 --> 01:30:10,452
Pennywise, motherfuckers.
Let's hear it for us.

1438
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:13,284
This is a fuckin' family up here,
motherfuckers!

1439
01:30:13,356 --> 01:30:15,347
This shit don't happen.

1440
01:30:18,061 --> 01:30:19,551
I love you guys.

1441
01:30:19,629 --> 01:30:21,119
I love you guys!

1442
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:24,690
<i>I guess it's part of us
getting to a certain age,</i>

1443
01:30:24,768 --> 01:30:26,759
<i>but our drummer's mom passed away,</i>

1444
01:30:26,837 --> 01:30:29,499
<i>and then Fletcher's brother
passed away.</i>

1445
01:30:29,573 --> 01:30:31,837
<i>You know, we had Jason.</i>

1446
01:30:31,908 --> 01:30:34,035
Pennywise! Pennywise!

1447
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:35,771
<i>You know, we're all men.</i>

1448
01:30:35,846 --> 01:30:39,509
<i>It's hard to sit there
and pour your heart out to each other.</i>

1449
01:30:42,853 --> 01:30:45,048
L.A., I love you!
Here we go!

1450
01:30:45,121 --> 01:30:49,057
#Whoa, oh, oh, oh #

1451
01:30:51,361 --> 01:30:53,420
Everyone here, let me hear you.

1452
01:30:53,497 --> 01:30:56,625
#Whoa, oh, oh, oh #

1453
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:59,999
#Whoa, oh, oh, oh #

1454
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:11,408
Let's hear it!

1455
01:31:19,589 --> 01:31:21,079
Yeah, to you!

1456
01:31:21,157 --> 01:31:25,491
#Whoa, oh, oh, oh #

1457
01:31:25,562 --> 01:31:30,465
#Whoa, oh, oh, oh #

1458
01:31:30,534 --> 01:31:34,630
#Whoa, oh, oh, oh #

1459
01:31:34,704 --> 01:31:41,132
#Whoa, oh, oh, oh ##

1460
01:31:52,956 --> 01:31:56,221
Thank you, L. A! We're Pennywise!
We'll see you next time!

1461
01:32:12,442 --> 01:32:14,433
<i>We did something and it was great,</i>

1462
01:32:14,511 --> 01:32:16,570
<i>and it was filled with
all the drama oflife...</i>

1463
01:32:16,646 --> 01:32:20,673
<i>the tragedy, the success,
the fun times, the not-so-fun times.</i>

1464
01:32:21,885 --> 01:32:25,821
<i>It's time to just put
the final chapter on it.</i>

1465
01:32:28,892 --> 01:32:31,554
<i>Kind of made the decision
in, like, the last few hours...</i>

1466
01:32:31,628 --> 01:32:34,893
<i>that I'm gonna tell the guys
that I don't wanna do it anymore.</i>

1467
01:32:34,965 --> 01:32:37,695
It's a crazy day.
I quit Pennywise today.

1468
01:32:39,069 --> 01:32:40,559
Yeah.

1469
01:32:42,172 --> 01:32:47,667
It's official. I told Randy and Byron, but Fletcher
won't answer my phone calls for the last three days.

1470
01:32:49,012 --> 01:32:51,845
<i>I didn't want to be sitting
in a hotel in Pittsburgh...</i>

1471
01:32:51,915 --> 01:32:55,715
<i>and missing the soccer game
and the piano recital.</i>

1472
01:32:55,785 --> 01:32:57,980
<i>I didn't want to miss out
on some important thing...</i>

1473
01:32:58,054 --> 01:32:59,851
<i>that I needed to be there for
for my kids...</i>

1474
01:32:59,923 --> 01:33:02,892
<i>or miss some lessons
that they needed to be taught...</i>

1475
01:33:02,959 --> 01:33:05,655
<i>that I wasn't there for.</i>

1476
01:33:07,263 --> 01:33:10,892
<i>Now is a great opportunity
to try different things with writing...</i>

1477
01:33:10,967 --> 01:33:12,867
<i>or other types of music...</i>

1478
01:33:12,936 --> 01:33:14,870
<i>or doing soundtrack stuff.</i>

1479
01:33:14,938 --> 01:33:18,931
<i>But at the same time, I'm not above
anything to take a regular job.</i>

1480
01:33:20,043 --> 01:33:22,307
<i>The, uh, statement came down on Friday.</i>

1481
01:33:22,379 --> 01:33:24,313
<i>Let me read this,
and then we'll discuss.</i>

1482
01:33:24,381 --> 01:33:28,647
<i>"After 19 years with Pennywise, Jim Lindberg
has decided to step down as lead singer,</i>

1483
01:33:28,718 --> 01:33:31,585
<i>and we wish Jim the best luck
in his new ventures, whatever they may be. "</i>

1484
01:33:31,655 --> 01:33:33,987
<i>But "F"him, it says here.
I don't think it...</i>

1485
01:33:34,057 --> 01:33:35,718
<i>I'm sorry. That was an ad lib.</i>

1486
01:33:35,792 --> 01:33:37,589
<i>He's got a family,
and he wants to...</i>

1487
01:33:37,661 --> 01:33:41,461
<i>He's a punk-rock dad, for God's sakes. He wants
to be more dad and less punk rock, it sounds like.</i>

1488
01:33:41,531 --> 01:33:44,193
<i>Um, you said that.
I didn't say that.</i>

1489
01:33:44,267 --> 01:33:48,328
<i>I mean, like, we gotta respect the fact that
he wants to spend more time with his family,</i>

1490
01:33:48,405 --> 01:33:51,169
<i>and he doesn't want to tour as much.</i>

1491
01:33:59,249 --> 01:34:02,912
You don't take risks and you
don't gamble with your children.

1492
01:34:02,986 --> 01:34:08,288
You can take risks for yourself. I don't think
we have the right to take risks with our children.

1493
01:34:08,358 --> 01:34:13,091
There's one thing to be an individual. There's another thing
to be an individual at the cost of the people around you.

1494
01:34:13,163 --> 01:34:18,100
I'm tired of watchin' my life go by
like a fuckin' really fast movie.

1495
01:34:18,168 --> 01:34:20,864
<i>It's like a fuckin' bad Twilight Zone.</i>

1496
01:34:20,937 --> 01:34:23,929
I'm raising my kid...

1497
01:34:24,007 --> 01:34:25,998
the way I wish I had been raised.

1498
01:34:26,076 --> 01:34:28,169
I think that's what
we're all doing.

1499
01:34:29,345 --> 01:34:33,338
<i>Someone said the other day to me,
"Man, I wish you were my father. "</i>

1500
01:34:33,416 --> 01:34:35,543
<i>I go, "Me too.</i>

1501
01:34:36,553 --> 01:34:39,215
I wish I was my father too. "

1502
01:34:39,289 --> 01:34:41,951
I know there's kids out there
that might be watching this...

1503
01:34:42,025 --> 01:34:44,516
or can relate
that are from broken homes,

1504
01:34:44,594 --> 01:34:46,789
and that you've clung to that anger.

1505
01:34:46,863 --> 01:34:49,764
<i>But you learn over time,
you learn to take the anger...</i>

1506
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:51,960
<i>and make it something positive.</i>

1507
01:34:52,035 --> 01:34:55,232
<i>You take a negative to positive,
which is gonna put you on top,</i>

1508
01:34:55,305 --> 01:34:58,900
<i>which is another whole type oflevel
of punk rock feeling...</i>

1509
01:34:58,975 --> 01:35:01,102
<i>oflike flippin'a switch.</i>

1510
01:35:01,177 --> 01:35:03,668
<i>I just felt there was a better world
out there,</i>

1511
01:35:03,747 --> 01:35:05,977
<i>that with a little bit of unity
and cooperation,</i>

1512
01:35:06,049 --> 01:35:08,040
<i>we could all
make this place better.</i>

1513
01:35:08,118 --> 01:35:12,145
<i>And it's very idealistic, it's a very
young person's way oflooking at the world.</i>

1514
01:35:12,222 --> 01:35:15,020
<i>But I think once you get older,
you get a little more realistic,</i>

1515
01:35:15,091 --> 01:35:17,753
<i>but that's what I wanna have,
that's what I wanna hold on to...</i>

1516
01:35:17,827 --> 01:35:20,318
<i>is that feeling
that we can make a change out there.</i>

1517
01:35:20,396 --> 01:35:24,730
<i>Maybe the way we change the world
is by raising better kids...</i>

1518
01:35:24,801 --> 01:35:27,065
<i>and being more attentive
to those kids.</i>

1519
01:35:27,137 --> 01:35:30,072
<i>And, um, maybe that's how
we change the world...</i>

1520
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:34,270
<i>Instead ofby writing a punk rock song,
maybe we just be better parents.</i>

1521
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:43,909
<i>I wanna be around for my kids.
I wanna be, um...</i>

1522
01:35:43,987 --> 01:35:46,478
<i>I wanna be there
when they want me to be there,</i>

1523
01:35:46,556 --> 01:35:49,548
<i>and I think that's
the punkest thing of all.</i>

1524
01:36:03,673 --> 01:36:05,766
<i>#Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah #</i>

1525
01:36:05,842 --> 01:36:09,710

<i># You remember #</i>

1535
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:42,544

<i>#I was a teenage anarchist #</i>

1539
01:36:59,362 --> 01:37:02,354

1540
01:37:02,432 --> 01:37:05,526
<i>#In the depths of their humanity #</i>

1541
01:37:05,602 --> 01:37:08,594
<i>#All I saw was bloodless ideology #</i>

1542
01:37:08,671 --> 01:37:11,663
<i># With freedom as a doctrine #</i>

1543
01:37:11,741 --> 01:37:14,904

01:37:14,978 --> 01:37:18,038

01:37:18,114 --> 01:37:21,845

01:37:46,209 --> 01:37:51,841
<i># When you were young
and you wanted to set the world on fire? #</i>

1551
01:37:53,349 --> 01:37:55,579
She wants us
to start a swear jar.

1552
01:37:55,652 --> 01:37:58,120
But I think all the
money's gonna go to her.

1553
01:37:58,187 --> 01:38:00,121
So it's, you know...
She'll call you out on it.

1554
01:38:00,189 --> 01:38:02,180
You'll be, like, "Damn it. "
And she's, like, "Daddy. "

1555
01:38:02,258 --> 01:38:04,488
I mean, crap!
"Crap" is like a quarter.

1556
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,790
I'm, like, crap is... No,
"crap" is in the dictionary.

1557
01:38:06,863 --> 01:38:09,627
Does anybody really get
offended by the word "fuck"?

1558
01:38:09,699 --> 01:38:11,929
Anybody? Really?
I don't think so.

1559
01:38:12,001 --> 01:38:14,936
But yet, when we're around people
that we don't know that well,

1560
01:38:15,004 --> 01:38:17,063
we don't say it.

1561
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:20,200
Let's bring down these
walls between people.

1562
01:38:20,276 --> 01:38:23,905
The word "fuck" can being
us together as humans.

1563
01:38:24,547 --> 01:38:26,811
Fuck the neighbors.

1564
01:38:26,883 --> 01:38:29,909
Why? I don't know. They're close by.

1565
01:38:29,986 --> 01:38:31,613
I don't know
what's going on.

1566
01:38:31,688 --> 01:38:33,679
Sounds like
that cat's dying.

1567
01:38:33,756 --> 01:38:35,656
I'm not a cat guy.

1568
01:38:35,725 --> 01:38:39,286
It was the first time I had to, uh,
actually lay down the law as a dad,

1569
01:38:39,362 --> 01:38:41,296
and it was not easy.

1570
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:45,767
The thing I can't give him
is orange juice.

1571
01:38:45,835 --> 01:38:47,962
There's just a blowout
after that, man.

1572
01:38:48,037 --> 01:38:51,165
It's just like you're running
around with a bucket behind him.

1573
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,401
The craziest colors come
out. You know what I mean?

1574
01:38:53,476 --> 01:38:56,445
You're like, "What kind of
fuckin' shade of green is that?"

1575
01:38:56,512 --> 01:38:58,503
I wish I could get
my hair that color.

1576
01:38:58,581 --> 01:39:00,344
I'll never be
as old as DEVO.

1577
01:39:00,416 --> 01:39:03,214
I keep
telling myself that.

1578
01:39:03,286 --> 01:39:05,550
Can I ask how old you
are? Is that okay? Yeah.

1579
01:39:05,621 --> 01:39:07,612
How old are you?
Thirty-eight.

1580
01:39:07,690 --> 01:39:11,387
No, 58. I know I had you
fooled there for a second.
