33
00:06:45,886 --> 00:06:48,296
Yeah, I know it's been awhile.

34
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:49,713
How are ya doing?

35
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,539
Look, I'm sorry to call you so late.

36
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:57,277
I'm gonna be in town
the next couple of days

37
00:06:57,277 --> 00:07:00,616
and I was wondering if I could stay

38
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:02,699
at your place for awhile.

39
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:07,868
No, everything's cool.

40
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:13,369
I, I just need to get out
of the city for awhile.

41
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:20,373
Hey, great.

42
00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:24,143
I'll be there in the morning.

43
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:27,149

44
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,939

Brett Murdock?

- Yeah.

97
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:32,775
He moved out two, three years ago.

98
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,645
I talked to him once before we moved in.

99
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:35,645
You his son?

00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,116
- What?

107
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:24,722
- I thought you were getting
here earlier this morning?

108
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:28,260
- Oh, yeah, I did a little sight seeing.

109
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,638
So all this is yours now?

110
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:32,914
- Yep, the folks moved
out about five years ago.

111
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:34,133
Dad's work moved him to London

112
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,533
so they let me keep the place.

113
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:40,700
I can barely afford it, but
someday, it'll all be mine.

114
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,696
You sounded pretty weird last night.

115
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:45,529
You're not running from the law

116
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:46,577
by any chance are ya?

117
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:47,410
(laughs)

118
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,896
- [Tyge] I'm afraid not.

119
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:50,151
- [Deke] Damn

120
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:53,252
Ah well, you look like
you could use a drink.

121
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:54,085
I'm buying.

122
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:56,248
- Can I get you anything else?

123
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:57,538
- I don't think so.

124
00:12:57,538 --> 00:12:58,637
- All right, enjoy your meal.

125
00:12:58,637 --> 00:12:59,470
- Thanks.

126
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,777
I guess it's been, what, 10 years?

127
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:04,355
- Has it been that long?

128
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:07,105
- [Deke] Shit, we're gettin' old.

129
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,775
- I haven't heard anything
about a reunion yet.

130
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:10,608
Have you?

131
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:13,116
- No, and that's fine with me.

132
00:13:13,116 --> 00:13:16,295
Shit, half of our class
were fucking morons.

133
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,495
Those were the ones that never left town.

134
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:20,245
I see them every day.

135
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:25,866
Case in point.

136
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:28,759
You remember Zack Ledanakoh, right?

137
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,592
- [Tyge] I think so.

138
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:30,425
- Oh sure you do.

139
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:32,589
He ran the school radio station.

140
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:33,778
You know the one you couldn't even pick up

141
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:35,652
in the parking lot?

142
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:37,011
- [Tyge] Okay.

143
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:37,844
- Zack!

144
00:13:44,652 --> 00:13:46,372
- [Zack] Hey, you just get here?

145
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:47,663
- [Deke] Yep, thought
we'd get a couple drinks

146
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:49,772
and do some catching up.

147
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:50,924
- Cool.

148
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:52,491
- [Zack] Sup Tyge, how you been?

149
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:53,884
I heard you moved to L.A. years ago.

150
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:56,092
- [Tyge] L.A.'s not really my scene.

151
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:57,924
- [Zack] So how long are
you going to be in town?

152
00:13:57,924 --> 00:13:59,453
- I'm not sure yet.

153
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:00,844
- Still making movies?

154
00:14:00,844 --> 00:14:02,666
Oh, I heard there are still a few copies

155
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,124
floating around of that
shitty horror movie you made

156
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:06,575
back when we were in high school.

157
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:08,604
A friend of mine down
at Sunny's Video Shack,

158
00:14:08,604 --> 00:14:09,604
remember that place?

159
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:10,866
- Yeah, I used to work there.

160
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:13,146
- He told me they still have a copy of it.

161
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:14,855
What was the name of that thing?

162
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,295
Dark something.

163
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:19,383
It was Dark...

164
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:20,495
- Dark Aura.

165
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:24,732
- That's right, man, oh
geez, that shit was painful.

166
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:27,222
- Whew, it's been an experience talking

167
00:14:27,222 --> 00:14:28,972
with you again, Zack.

168
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:31,633
I gotta make a phone call.

169
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:33,170
Are you ready for another one?

170
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,673
- [Deke] I'm still working on this one.

171
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:35,673
- All right.

172
00:14:43,941 --> 00:14:45,192
- What?

173
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:46,392
- What was that?

174
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:48,369
Why are you acting like a little bitch?

175
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:50,565
- Relax, I was just playing with him.

176
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:51,962
- [Deke] Anyway, Tyge is
going to be staying with us

177
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:53,885
for a couple of days.

178
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:54,965
- What?

179
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:56,474
Why?

180
00:14:56,474 --> 00:14:58,074
- He's my best friend.

181
00:14:58,074 --> 00:14:59,936
I haven't seen him in years.

182
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:02,114
- Yeah, well he gives me the creeps.

183
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:06,674
- Zack, no offense byt sometimes
you give me the creeps.

184
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:10,154
- Oh no, I am not coming
down there tonight.

185
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:11,664
Look, hello.

186
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:14,414
Hello, I can barely hear ya, man.

187
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:19,274
Oh, look, can't this wait until tomorrow?

188
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:22,234
I mean I already gave them a statement.

189
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,944
Look, are they charging you with anything?

190
00:15:24,944 --> 00:15:26,794
Well then tell them I
wiLL be there tomorrow.

191
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:28,704
You're my agent, make something up.

192
00:15:28,704 --> 00:15:31,257
That's what you do best.

193
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:33,257
(sighs)

194
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:39,611
What time do you want me to be there?

195
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:40,834
(sighs)

196
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:41,667
Hello.

197
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:43,944
John.

198
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,354
Hello!

199
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:48,490
(sighs)
Oh shit.

200
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,442
Ashley.

201
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:51,144
- Don't hit me.

202
00:15:51,144 --> 00:15:53,802
- Oh, no, I just...

203
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:55,302
I lost the signal.

204
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,132
What are you doing here?

205
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:00,449
- I came to get a drink.

206
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:04,282
- No, I mean, what are
you doing back in town?

207
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,397
- Is that all you can say?

208
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,852
- It's been a long time, Ash.

209
00:16:14,852 --> 00:16:17,270
I just didn't expect us to
run into each other like this,

210
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,510
you know, I mean, I
haven't seen you since--

211
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,593
- Graduation.

212
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:24,789
10 years.

213
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:26,932
We're gettin' old.

214
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:29,849
(slow piano music)

215
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:35,892
Well, I think I'm just going to go.

216
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:40,460
- Well wait, I mean, how have you been?

217
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,590
I mean, are you here visiting family?

218
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,423
- Kinda.

219
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:51,976
Well, my sister's dead.

220
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:58,926
- Diana.

221
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,790
My god.

222
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,790
- Wrong one.

223
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,125
- Mikki?

224
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,733
Ash, what happened?

225
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:17,675
- Well, she killed herself.

226
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,005
- I'm...

227
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:28,234
I'm so sorry.

228
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,593
- Yeah, I don't, I don't
know why I came here.

229
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,601
I've got all this running around to do

230
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:35,851
and everything.

231
00:17:38,138 --> 00:17:41,859
I'm staying at my parents
house while I'm in town.

232
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,776
Do you need the number?

233
00:17:45,844 --> 00:17:47,177
- I remember it.

234
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:52,515
Call me.

235
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:54,265
If you want.

236
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:59,595
- Are you gonna be okay?

237
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:05,054
- I'll be fine.

238
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:11,826
- Whoa, calm down loverboy.

239
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,631
Was that who I think it was?

240
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:16,882
Yeah.

241
00:18:16,882 --> 00:18:17,715
(laughs)

242
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:20,798
And how is the fine Ms. Lomack doing?

243
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,433
Is something wrong?

244
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:30,682
- She said her sister
Mikki just passed away.

245
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:36,251
What?

246
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:38,751
- Mikke died back in '98, man.

247
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:40,755
- But--

248
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:41,820
- [Deke] I shit you not.

249
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,634
She was living with her
grandparents at the time.

250
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:47,463
She didn't get along
with her folks too well.

251
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:49,660
Anyway, the police found
her in the basement.

252
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,863
Cuts all over her body.

253
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,280
Blood everywhere.

254
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:56,882
Oh, you know what's real
fucked up about that?

255
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:59,023
On the night that Mikki
died, her grandparents

256
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:01,554
were killed in a car accident.

257
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:03,554
Brake failure I think.

258
00:19:03,554 --> 00:19:04,482
(scoffs)

259
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:05,899
Lovely story huh?

260
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,031
- I never head anything about that.

261
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:13,164
And Ash just made it sound
like it happened yesterday.

262
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:15,266
- Well, come on, let's go.

263
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:18,266
I can only take Zack in small doses.

264
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,595
- So why didn't Zack get into radio?

265
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,595
I seem to remember him
being pretty good at it.

266
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:26,075
- [Deke] You mean that was the only thing

267
00:19:26,075 --> 00:19:26,908
he was good at.

268
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:29,825
Well, Zack was in radio for awhile.

269
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:35,314
The local news, sports
broadcast here and there.

270
00:19:35,314 --> 00:19:37,577
Nothing too spectacular.

271
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:38,755
(sighs)

272
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:40,587
When his aunt, uncle, and cousin died,

273
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:43,425
he pretty much lost interest in that.

274
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:46,665
Pretty much lost interest in everything.

275
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:48,945
- Oh yeah.

276
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:50,462
Weren't they some of those
people that were murdered

277
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:52,962
back up in Ditmer back in '93?

278
00:19:55,742 --> 00:19:57,172
What?

279
00:19:57,172 --> 00:20:00,172
(upbeat rock music)

280
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:05,052
Damn.

281
00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:06,052
What a slob.

282
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:15,793
So how long has Zack been living with you?

283
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:16,910
- [Deke] Too long.

284
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,951
He was going through a lot of shit

285
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:21,663
so I thought I'd be helping the guy out

286
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:23,933
by letting him move in, you know?

287
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:26,194
That's what I get for thinkin'.

288
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:30,361
("I Sold My Soul To A
Frankenhooker" by Frankenhookers)

289
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,652
- What's this?

290
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:47,069
- [Deke] Hang on.

291
00:20:49,821 --> 00:20:51,402
Ah, here it is.

292
00:20:51,402 --> 00:20:53,980
That marking is for the vulture deity.

293
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,813
- Excuse me, the what?

294
00:20:58,522 --> 00:20:59,939
- Listen to this.

295
00:21:05,886 --> 00:21:08,886
(suspenseful music)

296
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:10,860
- [Male Voice On Tap]
A shocking and bizarre

297
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,755
event in Jefferson County last night.

298
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:17,797
Wendell Ledanakoh age 39
brutally murdered and partially

299
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:22,325
devoured six victims including
her husband, Gary Ledanakoh.

300
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:25,167
The mass murder took place
on the Ledanakoh's property

301
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,887
in Ditmer, Missouri.

302
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:29,738
Authorities were told of
the killings by Mikki Lomack

303
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:31,298
age 22.

304
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:33,917
Lomack was with the party
that was murdered but managed

305
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,157
to escape.

306
00:21:35,157 --> 00:21:38,397
Authorities who arrived to take
Mrs. Ledanakoh into custody

307
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,306
say that Ledanakoh was
obviously in a state

308
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:43,674
of deteriorated mental health.

309
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:45,495
Ledanakoh is currently being held

310
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:49,162
at Harrison Mental
Institution in St. Louis.

311
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:52,584
In other news...

312
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:55,195
The Gateway Arch.

313
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,067
- [Female On Tape] You are
listening to KMJW News and--

314
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:10,759
- Bizarre huh?

315
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,342
- That's how he found
ut about the murders?

316
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:27,655
I had no idea.

317
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:31,373
- Gary, Lynn, and Karen
was his only family.

318
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:33,373
It really fucked him up.

319
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:36,695
That was the end of his radio career.

320
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:39,146
- So what's the deal with these notebooks?

321
00:22:39,146 --> 00:22:40,866
Is Zack researching for something?

322
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:43,292
- They belonged to his Uncle Gary.

323
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:44,853
After the investigation, the police

324
00:22:44,853 --> 00:22:46,613
just handed them over to Zack.

325
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:49,204
Those two used to do all
kinds of shit together.

326
00:22:49,204 --> 00:22:51,354
Anything with a history to it.

327
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:53,975
They'd go to civil war reenactments.

328
00:22:53,975 --> 00:22:57,295
They'd research local ghost stories.

329
00:22:57,295 --> 00:22:58,820
That's what got him interested
in all of the Indian

330
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,055
legends and myths about the area.

331
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:02,724
- What's the deal with these rocks.

332
00:23:02,724 --> 00:23:04,565
- Zack's notebooks say
that there was a Cherokee

333
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:06,227
tribe that settled in the area,

334
00:23:06,227 --> 00:23:10,645
after they fled the Trail of
Tears, back in the late 1830's.

335
00:23:10,645 --> 00:23:11,965
One of the tribe's
spiritual elders started

336
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:13,699
messing around with this black magic

337
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:15,547
and communicating with demons.

338
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:16,907
Each of the symbols are
supposed to represent

339
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:18,805
a different demon that the elders

340
00:23:18,805 --> 00:23:19,985
had cahoots with.

341
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:22,096
oN the morning of their annual harvest,

342
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:23,935
the tribe went out to the fields and found

343
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,147
that all of their crops had been turned

344
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:26,147
into stones.

345
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,625
Each of the stones had
an animal marking on it.

346
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,208
Just like this one.

347
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:33,975
- That's creepy.

348
00:23:33,975 --> 00:23:35,735
- [Deke] The elder was
killed and most of the tribe

349
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:39,716
fled the land, fearing
now that it was cursed.

350
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:42,916
Most of 'em froze to death that winter.

351
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,116
- Damn.

352
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:46,292
- The rocks became
passageways for the demons

353
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,695
that now roam the land to
possess anyone that make

354
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:50,934
physical contact with them.

355
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:52,615
The demon whose symbol is on the rock

356
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:54,135
is the one that possesses you.

357
00:23:54,135 --> 00:23:56,703
The demon supposedly won't awaken and have

358
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:58,794
the ability to possess you
unless one of the descendents

359
00:23:58,794 --> 00:24:01,133
of that Cherokee elder guy
steps onto the cursed land.

360
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:02,575
I think Zack and Gary made translations

361
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:05,124
for over 40 demons in all.

362
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:05,957
- Huh.

363
00:24:07,954 --> 00:24:11,121
They've got the spider.

364
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:15,721
And the scorpion.

365
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:19,707
The bobcat's.

366
00:24:21,383 --> 00:24:22,466
And the boar.

367
00:24:23,406 --> 00:24:24,239
Snake.

368
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:29,249
And the wolf.

369
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:33,233
The vulture.

370
00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:38,321
Ah, leech.

371
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:39,154
Thanks.

372
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:45,422
Here's a weird one.

373
00:24:45,422 --> 00:24:46,381
- What?

374
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:47,714
- The demon man.

375
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:51,892
If someone touches a rock
with the man demon symbol

376
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:54,561
on it, they are possessed
by the most dangerous

377
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:55,721
demon of all.

378
00:24:55,721 --> 00:24:58,033
Someone possessed by the
man demon won't attack

379
00:24:58,033 --> 00:25:00,033
and kill like an animal.

380
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:02,386
It thinks.

381
00:25:04,361 --> 00:25:07,129
It will plan ways to have as much control

382
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:10,796
over as many other human
beings as possible.

383
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:14,229
All that from touching a rock?

384
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,406
What's this stuff about
invisible barriers?

385
00:25:18,406 --> 00:25:19,489
- Let me see.

386
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:25,260
Oh, yeah, that's just
part of the legend, man.

387
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,093
- Hmmph.

388
00:25:28,578 --> 00:25:32,000
So does Zack really think that
there's a connection between

389
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,468
these stories and his family being killed?

390
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:36,214
- Think it'll make a good movie, Tyge?

391
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:37,796
- Dammit, you scared the shit out of me.

392
00:25:37,796 --> 00:25:40,772
What are you doing home so soon?

393
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,732
(sighs)
- Why do you think?

394
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:44,911
- You got fired again.

395
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:47,260
What is that, three jobs in two months?

396
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,041
What, are you going for
some kind of record?

397
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,708
- You couldn't resist, could ya?

398
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:56,111
- Zack, I was just telling
him about some Indian legends.

399
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:57,528
It's no big deal.

402
00:27:07,707 --> 00:27:08,635
- [Judy On Answering
Machine] Mason, hello,

403
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:09,555
it's mom.

404
00:27:09,555 --> 00:27:10,864
Just calling to see if you're planning

405
00:27:10,864 --> 00:27:13,245
on stopping by to see me on Sunday.

406
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:15,884
Your Fall break starts today, right?

407
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,854
If I'm not here when
you show up, I might be

408
00:27:17,854 --> 00:27:20,595
stopping by the old Lomack's farm.

409
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:22,805
I've got some clients coming by next week

410
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:23,797
to take a look at the place,

411
00:27:23,797 --> 00:27:25,077
if you can believe it.

412
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,909
Well, I guess that's it.

413
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:28,392
Call me when you get this.

414
00:27:28,392 --> 00:27:29,596
Say hi to Jessica for me.

415
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:31,539
I can't wait to meet her.

416
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:33,372
I love you, baby, bye.

417
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:37,365
(slow piano music)

418
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:46,499
- Friends?

419
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,332
- Sure.

420
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:53,720
- See ya tomorrow, Mason.

421
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:58,808

(upbeat rock music)

424
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:08,459
- Hi.

425
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:10,126
- You up for a ride?

426
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:22,313
("My Wish" by Somnia)

427
00:28:28,277 --> 00:28:31,019
- There's the old pharmacy
where my mom used to work.

428
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:33,200
- It looks a little run down.

429
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,960
- It's been abandoned for years.

430
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,877
I don't know why they
haven't torn it down yet.

431
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:47,653
I remember liking Autumn a
lot more when I was little.

432
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:51,059
I used to take these walks in the woods

433
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,142
behind my parent's house.

434
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:57,749
I remember how quiet the woods were.

435
00:28:57,749 --> 00:28:58,749
Not a sound.

436
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:03,040
The leaves were gone.

437
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,873
The woods looked like
they stretch on forever.

438
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:11,229
I can't stand the quiet now.

439
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:13,498
- So where are we going anyway?

440
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:15,029
I'm almost afraid to ask.

441
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:15,862
- [Ashley] You'll see.

442
00:29:15,862 --> 00:29:18,499
You'll get a kick out of it, trust me.

443
00:29:18,499 --> 00:29:21,249
- Like that ever got me anywhere.

444
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:25,320
- Nice to see some things haven't changed.

445
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,487
Same old Tyge.

446
00:29:43,488 --> 00:29:44,738
- Where are we?

447
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,113
Ash.

448
00:29:53,568 --> 00:29:56,568
(eerie piano music)

449
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:00,712
Are you okay?

450
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,768
What is this place?

451
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:09,549
- It's the old Ledanakoh property.

452
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:11,382
- Are you shittin' me?

453
00:30:13,341 --> 00:30:17,357
Hey, hey, where do you think you're goin'?

454
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,600
- I'm going to take a look around.

455
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,381
Are you coming or not?

456
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:24,280
- What do you think
you're going to find, Ash?

457
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,891
I mean, come on, I don't
think you really want

458
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:27,501
to be putting yourself through this.

459
00:30:27,501 --> 00:30:31,158
- Aren't you the least bit curious?

460
00:30:31,158 --> 00:30:33,158
(sighs)

461
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:19,621

(sinister music)

463
00:31:41,013 --> 00:31:42,846
There's nothing there.

464
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,368
There's nothing.

465
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:48,363
There's nothing there.

466
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:50,196
There's nothing there.

470
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:37,754
- Ashley!

471
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:43,500
Oh, my god.

472
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,333
Oh, my god.

473
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:45,333
Hey, Ashley.

474
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:48,595
Come here, come here.

475
00:32:48,595 --> 00:32:49,653
Wake up, Ash, come on.

476
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:50,777
(Ashley screams)
- No, no!

477
00:32:50,777 --> 00:32:51,610
- It's me.

478
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,443
- No, no.

479
00:32:52,443 --> 00:32:53,276
- It's me, it's all right.

480
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:54,109
- The blood.

481
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:55,649
- Your nose is bleeding,
your nose is bleeding.

482
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:56,540
Are you okay, Ash?

483
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,721
- No, where's--

484
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:01,804
- [Tyge] What, did you see something?

485
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:14,896
- I guess I got dizzy.

486
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,740
(sinister piano music)

487
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,492
- Here.

488
00:33:57,492 --> 00:33:58,409
Take these.

489
00:34:10,827 --> 00:34:14,267
And you should probably
still see a doctor.

490
00:34:14,267 --> 00:34:15,894
- Oh, I'll live.

491
00:34:15,894 --> 00:34:17,488
- Here.

492
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,238
Take a look at these.

493
00:34:20,696 --> 00:34:23,363
(macabre music)

494
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:26,745
- Where did you find them?

495
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:29,424
- Well, Deke Myrick showed
me this at his house

496
00:34:29,424 --> 00:34:31,107
last night.

497
00:34:31,107 --> 00:34:33,107
Remember Zack Ledanakoh?

498
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:35,936
Well, he's living with Deke, he's got

499
00:34:35,936 --> 00:34:37,945
a whole bunch of these.

500
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:41,336
I found this one up at
the Ledanakoh place.

501
00:34:41,336 --> 00:34:43,256
- Why are you keeping them?

502
00:34:43,256 --> 00:34:46,786
- Well, Deke was telling
me this really weird story

503
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:50,476
about where they came
from and, I just thought

504
00:34:50,476 --> 00:34:52,957
maybe you'd know something about it.

505
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,485
- Why?

506
00:34:54,485 --> 00:34:57,402
- Well, you know, because of Mikki.

507
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:01,776
- Sorry, Sherlock.

508
00:35:01,776 --> 00:35:05,216
I'm not in the mood to play right now.

509
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:07,037
I'm just going to take a nap

510
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:10,120
and try to shake this headache, okay?

511
00:35:10,957 --> 00:35:13,979
- Ash, you do know what
I'm talking about, right?

512
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:14,812
- Yes, Tyge.

513
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,015
I've heard all of Zack's stories before

514
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:20,437
and that's all they are, stories.

515
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:21,687
- Yeah, well...

516
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:30,789
I'll be downstairs if you need anything.

517
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:39,325
Your parents aren't going to be home

518
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:40,926
any time soon, are they?

519
00:35:40,926 --> 00:35:42,126
- Not for another week.

520
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:45,209
They're still in Florida on vacation.

521
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:46,972
- Good.

522
00:35:59,096 --> 00:36:00,899
- You think you're pretty tough, don't ya?

523
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:04,399
- Oh, my god, you've got to be kiddin' me.

524
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:10,798
It's time you die like the bitch you are.

525
00:36:11,882 --> 00:36:12,715
- Oh man.

528
00:37:15,262 --> 00:37:18,502
- [Mikki] I feel myself
rotting from the inside.

529
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:19,502
- What the--

530
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:25,844
- My work here is done.

531
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:28,677
There's nothing left for me to do.

534
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:40,772
They're coming for me.

535
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:41,993
I don't know what they're going to do

536
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,241
when they find me.

537
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:45,324

538
00:37:46,353 --> 00:37:49,186

00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:05,414
What?

547
00:39:05,414 --> 00:39:07,110
- Is Deke home?

548
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:07,943
- No.

549
00:39:23,198 --> 00:39:27,006
- What the fuck is your problem, man?

550
00:39:27,006 --> 00:39:27,839
- What the hell's that?

551
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,758
- Don't pretend you didn't
send this to Ashley.

552
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:31,566
- Man, are you out of your fucking mind?

553
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:33,376
- I'm not here to play
games with you, Zack.

554
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,955
I know you have a copy
of this in your bedroom.

555
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,038
- Okay, okay.

556
00:39:38,715 --> 00:39:40,355
- Where did you get that tape?

557
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:41,675
Why did you send it to her?

558
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:42,547
- None of your fucking business.

559
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,776
- Oh yeah, it becomes my fucking business

560
00:39:43,776 --> 00:39:45,115
when your stupid little mind games

561
00:39:45,115 --> 00:39:46,635
drive my friend to a mental breakdown.

562
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:49,801
Hasn't she been through
enough, you fucking psycho?

563
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:51,884
(grunts)

564
00:39:58,341 --> 00:40:00,672
- Don't ever call me that.

565
00:40:00,672 --> 00:40:02,102
I know the tape was a little dramatic

566
00:40:02,102 --> 00:40:03,254
but I know she wants those answers

567
00:40:03,254 --> 00:40:04,587
as much as I do.

568
00:40:12,581 --> 00:40:13,414
Where did you get that?

569
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:14,701
- Near your uncle's place.

570
00:40:14,701 --> 00:40:18,519
I went there with Ashley this afternoon.

571
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:21,602
These the answers you're looking for?

572
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:24,439
I know you've been through a lot, Zack,

573
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:25,272
but this...

574
00:40:25,272 --> 00:40:28,021
(sighs)

575
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:29,771
This answers nothing.

576
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:37,031
- Those stories that
Deke told you last night,

577
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:40,756
that was just a game for me,
something to pass the time.

578
00:40:40,756 --> 00:40:43,839
But, after the murders,

579
00:40:44,813 --> 00:40:46,046
the more I tried to figure out exactly

580
00:40:46,046 --> 00:40:48,129
what happened that night,

581
00:40:49,062 --> 00:40:52,824
the less it seemed like a game to me.

582
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:54,494
Maybe it was just my imagination getting

583
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:58,151
the best of me or maybe
it just took something

584
00:40:58,151 --> 00:41:00,073
like this to show me
the truth that had been

585
00:41:00,073 --> 00:41:01,406
there all along.

586
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:06,955
(eerie music)

587
00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:18,835
- This is crazy, Zack.

588
00:41:21,134 --> 00:41:24,140
Do you really expect for me
to take this stuff seriously?

589
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,582
- Read first, then decide.

590
00:41:26,582 --> 00:41:28,582
(sighs)

591
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:39,859
- Tyge!

592
00:41:42,732 --> 00:41:43,565
Tyge!

593
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:47,937
(sinister music)

594
00:42:25,032 --> 00:42:26,269
(screaming)

595
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:29,658
(Ashley screams)

596
00:42:29,658 --> 00:42:32,325
(macabre music)

597
00:42:34,992 --> 00:42:36,992
(gasps)

598
00:42:38,736 --> 00:42:41,236
(eerie music)

599
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,908
(screaming)

600
00:43:20,793 --> 00:43:21,626
Mikki.

601
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:27,747
- [Tyge] This is the second
time I've found her knocked out.

602
00:43:27,747 --> 00:43:29,113
She might have a concussion.

603
00:43:29,113 --> 00:43:30,547
- [Deke] Why didn't you
call of ran ambulance?

604
00:43:30,547 --> 00:43:32,247
What are we supposed to do for her?

605
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:33,871
- [Zack] Man, she don't look too good.

606
00:43:33,871 --> 00:43:35,337
- [Tyge] I knew I shouldn't
have left her alone.

607
00:43:35,337 --> 00:43:36,553
- Looks like she took one too many trips

608
00:43:36,553 --> 00:43:37,720
to happy land.

609
00:43:41,517 --> 00:43:42,658
- Holy shit.

610
00:43:42,658 --> 00:43:44,301
- What are they for?

611
00:43:44,301 --> 00:43:46,134
- It's for nightmares.

612
00:43:47,629 --> 00:43:50,462
Like the one I'm having right now.

613
00:43:52,153 --> 00:43:53,236
Get your own.

614
00:43:56,846 --> 00:43:58,015
- I'll be in the kitchen.

615
00:43:58,015 --> 00:43:59,015
Coffee's on.

616
00:44:25,197 --> 00:44:26,030
- Why...

617
00:44:29,295 --> 00:44:31,933
Why did you send me that tape?

618
00:44:31,933 --> 00:44:34,103
- I'm sorry if the package was a little--

619
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:35,521
- Fucking morbid.

620
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:36,937
- I know this is difficult for you, Ash,

621
00:44:36,937 --> 00:44:38,610
but I've lost people
that I care about too.

622
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,031
- Yeah and that's the
only reason I haven't

623
00:44:40,031 --> 00:44:42,215
fucking ripped your balls off yet.

624
00:44:42,215 --> 00:44:44,947
Look, Zack, I don't know
anything that you don't

625
00:44:44,947 --> 00:44:46,030
already know.

626
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:48,299
Mikki didn't talk to me
much after the murders

627
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:51,107
at the Ditmer, I mean, She didn't talk

628
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:53,149
to much of anybody after that.

629
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,861
- Do you think Mikki may have left

630
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:58,318
a journal or a diary, something that would

631
00:44:58,318 --> 00:44:59,998
give us an indication of what was going on

632
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:02,003
in her head when she committed suicide?

633
00:45:02,003 --> 00:45:03,427
Something that would give us some details

634
00:45:03,427 --> 00:45:05,164
about the murders.

635
00:45:05,164 --> 00:45:06,875
- I don't think so.

636
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,659
What are you looking for?

637
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:10,411
- I'm wondering if maybe
she wrote something down

638
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:11,987
about what happened that night.

639
00:45:11,987 --> 00:45:14,084
- You already know what happened.

640
00:45:14,084 --> 00:45:15,890
Six people were killed, Mikki flipped out

641
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,533
and killed herself five years later.

642
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:18,366
End of story.

643
00:45:18,366 --> 00:45:20,449
- Just hear me out, okay?

644
00:45:25,606 --> 00:45:28,404
- Okay, talk.

645
00:45:28,404 --> 00:45:31,391
- A friend of mine, a
cop, he showed me some

646
00:45:31,391 --> 00:45:34,083
crime scene photos of the victims.

647
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:35,510
He's also who hooked me up with the copy

648
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,423
of the tape that I sent you.

649
00:45:37,423 --> 00:45:40,862
Besides the fatal wounds on the victims,

650
00:45:40,862 --> 00:45:42,279
there were other,

651
00:45:44,195 --> 00:45:46,695
anomalies found on the bodies.

652
00:45:48,365 --> 00:45:49,365
- Like what?

653
00:45:50,413 --> 00:45:52,913
(eerie music)

654
00:46:08,483 --> 00:46:12,699
- My aunt died exactly a
year after she was committed

655
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:15,031
back in '93.

656
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:17,205
There was nothing anybody
could ever do for her.

657
00:46:17,205 --> 00:46:20,270
In the end she was like this animal,

658
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,603
completely void of human self awareness.

659
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:28,069
Just wasn't anything left inside at all.

660
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:29,619
- [Deke] Fuck.

661
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:31,452
Did she die in a fire?

662
00:46:32,475 --> 00:46:34,858
- [Tyge] They just found her like that?

663
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,191
- [Zack] Just a shriveled husk.

664
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:38,996
Her skin split open like road kill frying

665
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,246
on hot asphalt.

666
00:46:41,918 --> 00:46:45,047
It was as if she'd rotted from the inside.

667
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:46,142
- Is there a point to all of this.

668
00:46:46,142 --> 00:46:48,125
- I've known my aunt
my whole life, Ashley.

669
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:49,406
She'd never hurt anyone.

670
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:50,785
Reports say she killed
six people but I do not

671
00:46:50,785 --> 00:46:52,090
believe that.

672
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,436
- Zack, what's going on, buddy?

673
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,814
- [Zack] Something got
to my aunt that made

674
00:46:54,814 --> 00:46:55,775
her go insane.

675
00:46:55,775 --> 00:46:56,608
- That's it.

676
00:46:56,608 --> 00:46:57,441
Zack please, I'm leaving.

677
00:46:57,441 --> 00:46:58,945
- Something got to my aunt, the same thing

678
00:46:58,945 --> 00:47:00,088
that Mikki saw that night.

679
00:47:00,088 --> 00:47:01,773
- You're sick, I want,
all of you to get the hell

680
00:47:01,773 --> 00:47:02,606
out right now.

681
00:47:02,606 --> 00:47:04,368
- The same thing that
made Mikki kill herself.

682
00:47:04,368 --> 00:47:06,180
- I said get out!

683
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,281
Right now, I'm not listening
to this shit anymore.

684
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:09,672
Get out, Tyge, now!

685
00:47:09,672 --> 00:47:11,958
- Ashley would you calm down.

686
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:13,141
We're only trying to help.

687
00:47:13,141 --> 00:47:14,280
- No, I came here to get away from this.

688
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,057
Not listen to this bullshit.

689
00:47:16,057 --> 00:47:18,245
Hooray, hooray, at long
last I finally found out

690
00:47:18,245 --> 00:47:19,864
why my sister slit her
wrists and bled to death

691
00:47:19,864 --> 00:47:22,129
all over my grandparents farm.

692
00:47:22,129 --> 00:47:23,069
How stupid of me.

693
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:24,885
I should've known all along.

694
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:26,207
Mikki just came down with a nasty case

695
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,312
of demonitis, right?

696
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,735
Well thank you Dr. Murdock.

697
00:47:29,735 --> 00:47:31,287
Thank you Dr. Ledanakoh for your in depth

698
00:47:31,287 --> 00:47:32,888
clinical observation.

699
00:47:32,888 --> 00:47:34,255
I can finally put it all behind me.

700
00:47:34,255 --> 00:47:36,816
- Ashley, please, what
do you want me to say?

701
00:47:36,816 --> 00:47:41,233
- Nothing, why bother,
it won't change anything.

702
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,685
Are you having fun?

703
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:44,551
Is this amusing to you
seeing me like this,

704
00:47:44,551 --> 00:47:46,443
knowing full well you
don't have the faintest

705
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:47,791
fucking idea what I've been through?

706
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:48,821
- No, I am trying to help--

707
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:50,716
- I'm sorry you don't understand.

708
00:47:50,716 --> 00:47:51,580
I really am.

709
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,075
I don't understand it all myself.

710
00:47:54,075 --> 00:47:56,144
And maybe I never will.

711
00:47:56,144 --> 00:47:57,872
But maybe his is how Zack
decides to deal with it

712
00:47:57,872 --> 00:47:59,603
by playing a stupid game.

713
00:47:59,603 --> 00:48:01,485
But it's not a game, Tyge.

714
00:48:01,485 --> 00:48:03,336
People are dead and you're looking

715
00:48:03,336 --> 00:48:05,316
for some reason, some
cause that doesn't even

716
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:07,004
fucking exist.

717
00:48:07,004 --> 00:48:09,478
Do me a favor, look for it somewhere else.

718
00:48:09,478 --> 00:48:11,175
All of you.

719
00:48:11,175 --> 00:48:13,014
I'm not going to be a
part of this anymore.

720
00:48:13,014 --> 00:48:14,808
You guys go on your
scavenger hunt without me.

721
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,227
Don't let me ruin all the fun.

722
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,421
I'm going back home
tomorrow and forgetting

723
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:19,997
I ever fucking came back here.

724
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:20,830
- Ash.

725
00:48:22,272 --> 00:48:24,129
- That's for being a bastard.

726
00:48:24,129 --> 00:48:27,669
And for not being here when I needed you.

727
00:48:27,669 --> 00:48:31,169
Sorry I kicked your ass, nothing personal.

728
00:48:35,352 --> 00:48:37,324
- Well, that could've gone better.

729
00:48:37,324 --> 00:48:39,041
- I think I'm starting to get use to this.

730
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,002
- That was fun.

731
00:48:40,002 --> 00:48:41,721
Thank you both so much for
making me a part of that.

732
00:48:41,721 --> 00:48:44,546
Now unless you have an encore planned,

733
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,960
I really need to split.

734
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,085
I got some work I need to
finish up for a project

735
00:48:47,085 --> 00:48:48,367
on Monday.

736
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:51,029
- I want to go look around
her grandparents farm.

737
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:51,928
- What?

738
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,339
- There must be something there that Mikki

739
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:55,158
wanted Ashley to find, I mean, why else

740
00:48:55,158 --> 00:48:56,667
would she make that tape?

741
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,144
- Don't you think the cops would've found

742
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,865
whatever it is you're looking for?

743
00:48:59,865 --> 00:49:02,317
They searched the house after Mikki died.

744
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:04,079
- Why would the cops
do an extensive search

745
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,454
of the house if the house
was ruled a suicide?

746
00:49:06,454 --> 00:49:08,479
They had no reason to suspect foul play.

747
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:09,837
There must be something
there the cops overlooked.

748
00:49:09,837 --> 00:49:11,779
- Which would take forever to find.

749
00:49:11,779 --> 00:49:13,824
Man, you don't even know what it is you're

750
00:49:13,824 --> 00:49:15,006
looking for.

751
00:49:15,006 --> 00:49:16,554
Or if there's even anything there to find.

752
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:18,445
- [Zack] What would it hurt
to go out there and just

753
00:49:18,445 --> 00:49:19,278
look around?

754
00:49:19,278 --> 00:49:20,381
- Count me out.

755
00:49:20,381 --> 00:49:22,572
I'm just going to stay
around here and keep

756
00:49:22,572 --> 00:49:23,989
an eye on Ashley.

757
00:49:26,765 --> 00:49:29,427
- Call us if you change your mind.

758
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:32,219
("Girl Named Vegas" by Calico System)

759
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:35,038
♫ Where, where did you go

760
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:38,382
♫ I'm standing alone

761
00:49:38,382 --> 00:49:41,132
♫ You don't know

762
00:49:52,986 --> 00:49:54,938
♫ The first time

763
00:49:54,938 --> 00:49:58,580
♫ I laid my eyes on you

764
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,833
♫ I should have told you

765
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:05,083
♫ This love can't wait

766
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:09,006
♫ One minute longer

767
00:50:10,165 --> 00:50:13,933
♫ And if I hesitate

768
00:50:13,933 --> 00:50:17,579
♫ My chance is over

769
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:21,079
♫ And if I weren't so shy

770
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:22,768
- Hi.

771
00:50:23,901 --> 00:50:25,431
- Hi yourself.

772
00:50:25,431 --> 00:50:27,147
What are you still doing here?

773
00:50:27,147 --> 00:50:29,281
- Ah you know, I wanted to be here

774
00:50:29,281 --> 00:50:32,114
just in case you passed out again.

775
00:50:33,335 --> 00:50:35,252
You gonna hit me again?

776
00:50:36,123 --> 00:50:38,193
I helped myself to the fridge.

777
00:50:38,193 --> 00:50:39,026
Sorry.

778
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:41,584
- I noticed.

779
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:45,542
- I am sorry.

780
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:50,349
- I'm sorry, too.

781
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:52,766
Because I miss my medication.

782
00:50:54,642 --> 00:50:58,142
- You never did tell me why you came back.

783
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:04,373
- I guess I was looking for something

784
00:51:04,373 --> 00:51:08,206
that I didn't really need to know.

785
00:51:12,747 --> 00:51:16,747
But, I wanted to remember
Mikki the way she was.

786
00:51:17,702 --> 00:51:20,619
That's what was real.

787
00:51:22,491 --> 00:51:24,376
It's just all this demon shit's starting

788
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:27,094
to get a little too morbid for me.

789
00:51:27,094 --> 00:51:29,594
- Afraid you'll find monsters?

790
00:51:34,117 --> 00:51:36,950
You know, when I was 11 years old,

791
00:51:38,633 --> 00:51:41,800
I asked God to turn me into a monster.

792
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:46,218
(laughs)

793
00:51:46,218 --> 00:51:47,629
I even covered my ass and told him

794
00:51:47,629 --> 00:51:51,091
I'd be a good monster.

795
00:51:51,091 --> 00:51:53,255
- Okay.

796
00:51:53,255 --> 00:51:55,335
That's interesting.

797
00:51:55,335 --> 00:51:59,502
Why may I ask would you ask
for something like that?

798
00:52:01,587 --> 00:52:05,420
- I wanted to keep my
dad from beating my mom.

799
00:52:13,003 --> 00:52:16,753
But, God never answered me.

800
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,534
It was too late.

801
00:52:21,417 --> 00:52:23,417
(sighs)

802
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,500
We were about to do this shot

803
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,458
for a new film project I'm
working on in St. Louis

804
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:37,958
when I,

805
00:52:38,877 --> 00:52:42,967
I just stepped out to take a phone call,

806
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:44,915
two of the actors were going to run over

807
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:46,082
some blocking,

808
00:52:48,972 --> 00:52:52,222
the light fell from the scaffolding and

809
00:52:53,787 --> 00:52:56,931
hit one of the actors on the head.

810
00:52:56,931 --> 00:52:59,020
It split it wide open.

811
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:02,102
Blood everywhere.

812
00:53:02,102 --> 00:53:04,102
(sighs)

813
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:10,633
My whole life's been a fantasy.

814
00:53:12,285 --> 00:53:14,202
It's been make believe.

815
00:53:16,686 --> 00:53:19,853
But at that moment,

816
00:53:20,935 --> 00:53:22,196
at that one moment,

817
00:53:22,196 --> 00:53:26,363
it was, it was like I
was 11 years old again,

818
00:53:30,695 --> 00:53:34,862
afraid, alone.

819
00:53:35,902 --> 00:53:38,402
(eerie music)

820
00:53:42,692 --> 00:53:45,109
- It wasn't your fault, Tyge.

821
00:53:46,634 --> 00:53:49,697
(Tyge sighs)

822
00:53:49,697 --> 00:53:52,632
- Apparently dad was released from prison

823
00:53:52,632 --> 00:53:54,465
a couple of years ago.

824
00:53:55,324 --> 00:53:58,816
So I, went by the old house to see

825
00:53:58,816 --> 00:54:00,241
if he still lived there.

826
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:01,074
- Why?

827
00:54:03,459 --> 00:54:07,826
- Well, I wanted to show him

828
00:54:07,826 --> 00:54:11,993
that I'm not that scared
little boy he can hurt anymore.

829
00:54:12,926 --> 00:54:17,009
But, he moved away.

830
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:25,210
I don't know, maybe I'm
still that scared little boy,

831
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:29,377
scared that one day

832
00:54:30,843 --> 00:54:32,947
I'll look like my father.

833
00:54:32,947 --> 00:54:35,510
- [Ashley] Tyge, don't be ridiculous.

834
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:38,343
- Life just seems so meaningless.

835
00:54:41,983 --> 00:54:43,689
Trivial.

836
00:54:43,689 --> 00:54:47,522
- Chasing monsters isn't
going to change that.

837
00:54:50,794 --> 00:54:52,971
There was a part of me
that wanted to believe

838
00:54:52,971 --> 00:54:56,820
in Zack's stories too,
but look where it got him.

839
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,070
His life is consumed by it.

840
00:55:01,016 --> 00:55:02,791
I don't want to live my life like that.

841
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:04,781
And neither should you.

842
00:55:04,781 --> 00:55:08,031
- Maybe there is no magic in the world.

843
00:55:08,887 --> 00:55:10,268
- Maybe you're just looking for it

844
00:55:10,268 --> 00:55:11,851
in the wrong place.

845
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:25,142
(garage door motor whines)

846
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:43,831
- Ugh.

847
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:45,581
- Shit, what is that?

848
00:55:54,211 --> 00:55:55,764
Eh, it smells like your mom's making

849
00:55:55,764 --> 00:55:58,862
some of her famous ass chili again.

850
00:55:58,862 --> 00:56:00,360
Whew.

851
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,949
(scoffs)

852
00:56:01,949 --> 00:56:04,739
- Meat must have gone bad.

853
00:56:04,739 --> 00:56:07,656
(slow piano music)

854
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:11,451
(sighs)

855
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,513
Guess we'll just wait for mom to get back

856
00:56:12,513 --> 00:56:14,596
from her jog.

857
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,624
- [Ashley] Did you want
to go with Deke and Zach

858
00:56:19,624 --> 00:56:21,540
to my grandparents farm?

859
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,449
- [Tyge] We don't have to, Ash.

860
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:24,381
- [Ashley] It'll give me a chance

861
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:27,161
to say goodbye to the place.

862
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:28,328
- [Tyge] Okay.

863
00:56:33,313 --> 00:56:35,037
- [Zack] This place doesn't
look all that fuckin' abandoned.

864
00:56:35,037 --> 00:56:35,968
- [Deke] I think they're just renting out

865
00:56:35,968 --> 00:56:37,293
the land, you know, if you want to put

866
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,848
your cows here or something.

867
00:56:39,848 --> 00:56:40,854
- [Zack] How do you know that there's not

868
00:56:40,854 --> 00:56:42,087
somebody here right now?

869
00:56:42,087 --> 00:56:45,788
- [Deke] I think it's just the cows, man.

870
00:56:45,788 --> 00:56:48,955
- [Zack] This is off to a great start.

871
00:56:58,036 --> 00:57:01,274
Yep, creepy just like I imagined.

872
00:57:01,274 --> 00:57:03,788
- Let's get this over with.

873
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:07,138
- I can see why nobody's
bought the place yet.

874
00:57:07,138 --> 00:57:08,913
- Come on, sweetie, let's check out

875
00:57:08,913 --> 00:57:10,830
the big scary red barn.

876
00:57:13,753 --> 00:57:15,701
- You wanna go check out the lake?

877
00:57:15,701 --> 00:57:17,113
- That's fine with me.

878
00:57:17,113 --> 00:57:19,181
- You guys want to look around the house?

879
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:20,317
- Mm, maybe later.

880
00:57:20,317 --> 00:57:21,490
But there is a door around back that leads

881
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:22,726
down into the basement.

882
00:57:22,726 --> 00:57:24,326
The locks always been busted.

883
00:57:24,326 --> 00:57:25,999
- All right, give me
an hour to look around.

884
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:27,817
- [Deke] Who wants a roll in the hay?

885
00:57:27,817 --> 00:57:28,867
- That should give me enough time to hide

886
00:57:28,867 --> 00:57:30,030
Deke's body.

887
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,486
- [Deke] You don't know
what you're missing.

888
00:57:31,486 --> 00:57:33,904
I'll be the needle in your haystack.

889
00:57:33,904 --> 00:57:36,821
(slow piano music)

890
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,550
(sinister music)

891
00:58:52,194 --> 00:58:54,777
(door squeaks)

892
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:59,607
(foreboding piano music)

893
00:59:52,427 --> 00:59:54,442
- Is something wrong?

894
00:59:54,442 --> 00:59:56,859
- It's weird being back here.

895
00:59:57,891 --> 01:00:00,582
I've been gone way too long.

896
01:00:00,582 --> 01:00:04,093
(slow ominous piano music)

897
01:00:04,093 --> 01:00:06,760
(stairs squeak)

898
01:00:07,827 --> 01:00:10,994
(ominous piano music)

899
01:01:52,737 --> 01:01:53,883
(scoffs)

900
01:01:53,883 --> 01:01:54,883
- Fuck this.

901
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,233
- The last time I saw
Mikki, we were helping

902
01:01:58,233 --> 01:02:02,612
a cousin move into an
apartment in the city.

903
01:02:02,612 --> 01:02:06,195
I remember Mikki was
really quiet that day.

904
01:02:08,263 --> 01:02:11,680
And just before I left, she gave me this.

905
01:02:17,011 --> 01:02:19,718
It wasn't long after
that when those five kids

906
01:02:19,718 --> 01:02:21,837
went missing up at that church summer camp

907
01:02:21,837 --> 01:02:23,754
where she used to work.

908
01:02:28,341 --> 01:02:32,091
They found the kids in
the lake a week later.

909
01:02:35,325 --> 01:02:37,492
And they were all drowned.

910
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,330
(sighs)

911
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:44,997
Yep, that wasn't a very good year.

912
01:02:46,606 --> 01:02:49,273
(ominous music)

913
01:04:10,126 --> 01:04:12,126
(sighs)

914
01:04:20,736 --> 01:04:22,120
- [Deke] You two have fun?

915
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,620
I know I sure did.

916
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:37,256
Is he okay?

917
01:04:38,683 --> 01:04:40,266
- Mm, I don't know.

918
01:04:47,253 --> 01:04:49,121
So, where's your better half?

919
01:04:49,121 --> 01:04:52,038
- He's probably still in the house.

920
01:04:55,922 --> 01:04:56,755
Well?

921
01:04:56,755 --> 01:04:58,505
Ready to give up yet?

922
01:05:14,506 --> 01:05:15,339
- Hey.

923
01:05:15,339 --> 01:05:16,172
- How you doing?

924
01:05:16,172 --> 01:05:17,005
Whatcha working on?

925
01:05:17,005 --> 01:05:18,880
- A story for creative writing.

926
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,509
Except I've been in this
writer's block all week.

927
01:05:21,509 --> 01:05:23,601
So I've just been trying word association

928
01:05:23,601 --> 01:05:24,692
to work around it.

929
01:05:24,692 --> 01:05:26,492
- Not much happening?

930
01:05:26,492 --> 01:05:28,816
- Not really, but you look like you've got

931
01:05:28,816 --> 01:05:30,399
a lot on your mind.

932
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:33,665
- It's probably nothing but I think

933
01:05:33,665 --> 01:05:34,877
I'm going to take a quick walk down

934
01:05:34,877 --> 01:05:37,549
to the Lomack farm and see if Mom's there.

935
01:05:37,549 --> 01:05:38,909
- Why don't you just call down there?

936
01:05:38,909 --> 01:05:40,678
- The phone's still disconnected.

937
01:05:40,678 --> 01:05:42,943
Besides, I need to get
some fresh air anyway.

938
01:05:42,943 --> 01:05:45,054
- You need some company?

939
01:05:45,054 --> 01:05:47,984
(ominous music)

940
01:05:47,984 --> 01:05:51,067
- Oh, Zack, this is very interesting.

941
01:05:52,667 --> 01:05:54,910
We can watch it at my place.

942
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:56,033
I got to get going anyway, tyge needs

943
01:05:56,033 --> 01:05:57,238
to get going.

944
01:05:57,238 --> 01:05:58,702
- I'm fine.

945
01:05:58,702 --> 01:06:01,259
I just got a little dizzy.

946
01:06:01,259 --> 01:06:02,654
- I don't want to leave yet.

947
01:06:02,654 --> 01:06:03,659
There's still some areas of the house

948
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:04,684
I haven't checked out.

949
01:06:04,684 --> 01:06:06,373
- You're unbelievable.

950
01:06:06,373 --> 01:06:07,206
- What?

951
01:06:07,206 --> 01:06:08,817
- You don't know when to quit do you?

952
01:06:08,817 --> 01:06:11,152
- What the hell are you talking about?

953
01:06:11,152 --> 01:06:13,902
- This is what I'm talking about.

954
01:06:15,573 --> 01:06:17,424
Look familiar?

955
01:06:17,424 --> 01:06:18,706
Do you really expect us to believe

956
01:06:18,706 --> 01:06:20,448
you found this stuff
lying around the house?

957
01:06:20,448 --> 01:06:21,742
- I didn't find it lying around.

958
01:06:21,742 --> 01:06:23,723
I found it in the closet
in the bedroom upstairs.

959
01:06:23,723 --> 01:06:25,189
- Dammit, why don't you
knock this shit off, Zack?

960
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,569
- Why don't you fuck off?

961
01:06:27,569 --> 01:06:29,015
- What did you say?

962
01:06:29,015 --> 01:06:30,914
- Why can't you see what's happening here?

963
01:06:30,914 --> 01:06:32,947
I wouldn't pretend to find this stuff.

964
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,614
Why would I do that?

965
01:06:35,697 --> 01:06:37,009
All right look, I don't care if you guys

966
01:06:37,009 --> 01:06:37,848
believe me or not.

967
01:06:37,848 --> 01:06:39,817
Something really fucked is going on here.

968
01:06:39,817 --> 01:06:41,654
Okay, I'm not making this up.

969
01:06:41,654 --> 01:06:42,487
- Okay.

970
01:06:42,487 --> 01:06:44,101
I've had enough of this.

971
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:45,592
You want to play Nancy Drew, that's fine,

972
01:06:45,592 --> 01:06:47,679
but do it on your own.

973
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,871
When you guys are ready to leave,

974
01:06:49,871 --> 01:06:51,204
I'll be outside.

975
01:06:53,974 --> 01:06:55,500
- Deke, listen.

976
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,218
- No, you listen to me.

977
01:06:57,218 --> 01:06:58,405
I was willing to play along at first.

978
01:06:58,405 --> 01:07:02,021
I foolishly thought that
maybe you would come around.

979
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:05,188
But you'll always be a fucking psycho.

980
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:24,450
- I'm not a psycho.

981
01:07:27,233 --> 01:07:30,650
(melancholy piano music)

982
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,729
- [Mason] Jessica tells me
you're moving into her place.

983
01:08:00,729 --> 01:08:03,051
- [Zoe] Yeah, big sister commune.

984
01:08:03,051 --> 01:08:04,247
But I didn't have much of a choice.

985
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,995
My parents kicked me out a week ago.

986
01:08:05,995 --> 01:08:06,894
- Sorry to hear that.

987
01:08:06,894 --> 01:08:07,771
- Ah screw 'em.

988
01:08:07,771 --> 01:08:09,785
I'm a lot happier with Jess anyway..

989
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:11,861
- At least someone is.

990
01:08:11,861 --> 01:08:14,778
(slow piano music)

991
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,512
Who the hell is that?

992
01:08:24,512 --> 01:08:25,937
- [Zoe] Maybe your mom's
meeting some people

993
01:08:25,937 --> 01:08:27,231
to show 'em the place.

994
01:08:27,231 --> 01:08:28,814
Isn't that her job?

995
01:08:30,515 --> 01:08:31,537
- Come on.

996
01:08:31,537 --> 01:08:33,991
- [Zoe] Excuse me, what are we doing?

997
01:08:33,991 --> 01:08:34,982
- [Mason] What's it look like?

998
01:08:34,982 --> 01:08:36,557
Looking for my scatter-brained mother.

999
01:08:36,557 --> 01:08:39,005
- [Zoe] Oh lay off, I
think your mom's sweet.

1000
01:08:39,005 --> 01:08:42,103
Hey, did she sell small poshy jocks?

1001
01:08:42,103 --> 01:08:43,004
- [Mason] Probably.

1002
01:08:43,004 --> 01:08:44,729
(laughs)
- [Zoe] Awesome.

1003
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:47,411
- I don't know about that.

1004
01:08:47,411 --> 01:08:49,046
I really hate having to come home to see

1005
01:08:49,046 --> 01:08:50,249
that sad look in her eyes.

1006
01:08:50,249 --> 01:08:51,551
- Because of your dad?

1007
01:08:51,551 --> 01:08:52,718
- [Mason] Yep.

1008
01:08:53,575 --> 01:08:56,075
I know it's been six
years since he's died.

1009
01:08:56,075 --> 01:08:57,744
She still insists she's okay but,

1010
01:08:57,744 --> 01:08:59,974
I know better.

1011
01:08:59,974 --> 01:09:01,670
- Hey, you know, I was
thinking, what if that guy

1012
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,015
you saw was some kind of deranged murderer

1013
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:05,551
just posing as a client.

1014
01:09:05,551 --> 01:09:06,725
You ever think about that?

1015
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:08,736
Huh, huh?

1016
01:09:08,736 --> 01:09:13,137
- This would definitely
be a good place for one.

1017
01:09:13,137 --> 01:09:15,387
(cows moo)

1018
01:09:16,769 --> 01:09:17,893
Hello.

1019
01:09:17,893 --> 01:09:19,410
- [Zoe] Okay, you need
to share whatever it is

1020
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:20,532
that you're on.

1021
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:23,342
There's nobody here, dude.

1022
01:09:23,342 --> 01:09:24,734
- Maybe he's shy.

1023
01:09:24,734 --> 01:09:25,978
- Or maybe we should go back to the house

1024
01:09:25,978 --> 01:09:28,311
and look for your mom there.

1025
01:09:31,627 --> 01:09:32,460
- What?

1026
01:09:33,371 --> 01:09:34,968
(growling)

1027
01:09:34,968 --> 01:09:37,635
(Mason screams)

1028
01:09:48,121 --> 01:09:51,288
(screaming continues)

1029
01:10:15,262 --> 01:10:16,095
- Mason.

1030
01:10:16,095 --> 01:10:16,928
- Did you kill him?

1031
01:10:16,928 --> 01:10:17,776
- Yeah, I think so.

1032
01:10:17,776 --> 01:10:19,324
(growling)

1033
01:10:19,324 --> 01:10:20,637
Mason, we've got to get out of here.

1034
01:10:20,637 --> 01:10:21,536
Come on, get up.

1035
01:10:21,536 --> 01:10:22,369
You can do it, come on.

1036
01:10:22,369 --> 01:10:24,619
(grunting)

1037
01:10:27,255 --> 01:10:28,422
Somebody help!

1038
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:30,563
Help us!

1039
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,429
(sinister music)

1040
01:10:40,613 --> 01:10:42,280
- Fuck.

1041
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:45,578
- Deke!

1042
01:10:45,578 --> 01:10:46,411
- Deke!

1043
01:10:46,411 --> 01:10:48,812
- What's wrong with you?

1044
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:49,645
- Get away from him.

1045
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:50,478
He'll kill you.

1046
01:10:50,478 --> 01:10:51,311
- No!

1047
01:10:52,236 --> 01:10:53,069
- Deke!

1048
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,537
- Here, he gets near, you hit him.

1049
01:11:08,537 --> 01:11:10,370
- What the fuck, Deke?

1050
01:11:18,635 --> 01:11:19,948
- Ah.

1051
01:11:19,948 --> 01:11:22,448
(eerie music)

1052
01:11:25,987 --> 01:11:26,820
Ah.

1053
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,459
(growls)

1054
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:42,047
- Get the fuck off of me.

1055
01:11:50,977 --> 01:11:51,885
- Are you okay?

1056
01:11:51,885 --> 01:11:52,753
- Get him in the heart.

1057
01:11:52,753 --> 01:11:53,586
- What?

1058
01:11:53,586 --> 01:11:54,419
- Get him in the heart.

1059
01:11:54,419 --> 01:11:55,336
Run, do it.

1060
01:11:59,051 --> 01:12:00,084
Do it!

1061
01:12:00,084 --> 01:12:02,834
(sinister music)

1062
01:12:45,455 --> 01:12:46,872
What's happening?

1063
01:12:48,193 --> 01:12:50,693
(eerie music)

1064
01:13:39,255 --> 01:13:41,255
(sighs)

1065
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:46,873
- Who is he?

1066
01:13:46,873 --> 01:13:47,925
- According to his wallet,

1067
01:13:47,925 --> 01:13:49,836
his name's Mason Kerrigan.

1068
01:13:49,836 --> 01:13:50,713
He's lucky.

1069
01:13:50,713 --> 01:13:53,851
Any farther and it would've punctured

1070
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:55,351
his brain.

1071
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,868
He's lost a lot of blood though.

1072
01:14:06,749 --> 01:14:09,416
(monas in pain)

1073
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:15,167
(sinister music)

1074
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:19,891
- I'm going to get my notes.

1075
01:14:19,891 --> 01:14:21,641
We're gonna need 'em.

1076
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:27,456
- He's not holding up too well.

1077
01:14:27,456 --> 01:14:31,426
- It isn't every day you
kill your best friend.

1078
01:14:31,426 --> 01:14:34,053
(sighs)

1079
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:37,470
How can this all be happening?

1080
01:14:41,358 --> 01:14:43,191
All of Zack's stories,

1081
01:14:47,646 --> 01:14:49,063
they're all true.

1082
01:14:55,873 --> 01:15:00,040
Guess he found what we
were looking for after all.

1083
01:15:01,527 --> 01:15:03,801
- The girl's gone.

1084
01:15:03,801 --> 01:15:06,551
(sinister music)

1085
01:15:27,987 --> 01:15:30,987
(suspenseful music)

1086
01:15:44,615 --> 01:15:46,615
(gasps)

1087
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:53,412
- Oh, oh.

1088
01:15:55,998 --> 01:15:58,332
(screams)

1089
01:15:58,332 --> 01:15:59,657
- Did you hear that?

1090
01:15:59,657 --> 01:16:01,587
- Who do you think it is?

1091
01:16:01,587 --> 01:16:02,420
- Mom.

1092
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:05,457
- Hey, hey, listen, please don't move.

1093
01:16:05,457 --> 01:16:06,637
Be still.

1094
01:16:06,637 --> 01:16:08,637
Do you live around here?

1095
01:16:10,542 --> 01:16:14,288
- My mom, she lives up on the hill.

1096
01:16:14,288 --> 01:16:15,542
(grunts)

1097
01:16:15,542 --> 01:16:16,847
- [Tyge] Are we going
to just sit around here

1098
01:16:16,847 --> 01:16:17,680
and do nothing?

1099
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:18,513
- Where's Zoe?

1100
01:16:18,513 --> 01:16:19,481
- [Zack] She's running around out there.

1101
01:16:19,481 --> 01:16:21,505
- She's resting on the
couch in the living room.

1102
01:16:21,505 --> 01:16:23,038
- [Tyge] We should be anywhere rather than

1103
01:16:23,038 --> 01:16:24,504
sitting around on our asses.

1104
01:16:24,504 --> 01:16:25,957
- Tyge's right, Zack.

1105
01:16:25,957 --> 01:16:27,648
We'll check out the immediate front area.

1106
01:16:27,648 --> 01:16:31,315
We'll come right back
if we don't find them.

1107
01:16:34,741 --> 01:16:36,741
Keep a close eye on him.

1108
01:16:47,241 --> 01:16:49,741
(eerie music)

1109
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,510
(Sinister music)

1110
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:52,944
(heavy breathing)

1111
01:18:57,769 --> 01:18:58,991
(growling)

1112
01:18:58,991 --> 01:19:01,158
(screams)

1113
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:12,580
(Screams)

1114
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,270
(coughing)

1115
01:19:39,779 --> 01:19:42,696
(grunting in pain)

1116
01:19:45,134 --> 01:19:47,384
(coughing)

1117
01:20:03,095 --> 01:20:05,217
- Hey, you sure you don't want some?

1118
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:06,348
You never know.

1119
01:20:06,348 --> 01:20:07,551
It might be edible.

1120
01:20:07,551 --> 01:20:08,955
- [Jessica] It's been over two hours, Lee.

1121
01:20:08,955 --> 01:20:10,068
Something's wrong.

1122
01:20:10,068 --> 01:20:11,341
- [Lee] Hey relax, I'm sure everything's

1123
01:20:11,341 --> 01:20:13,101
going to be cool.

1124
01:20:13,101 --> 01:20:14,900
Pardon me, but didn't you and Mason

1125
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,961
part ways yesterday?

1126
01:20:16,961 --> 01:20:19,544
What's with the sudden concern?

1127
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,791
- I still care about him, Lee.

1128
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:24,460
I still want to be his friend.

1129
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:25,431
- You know I never could figure out

1130
01:20:25,431 --> 01:20:27,611
the whole relationship thing.

1131
01:20:27,611 --> 01:20:31,959
All that unnecessary work
just for a little pussy.

1132
01:20:31,959 --> 01:20:33,030
- Nice.

1133
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:36,609
Must be rough still being a virgin.

1134
01:20:36,609 --> 01:20:38,072
- Yeah, thanks.

1135
01:20:38,072 --> 01:20:40,073
(loud banging outside)

1136
01:20:40,073 --> 01:20:41,990
What the hell was that?

1137
01:20:43,137 --> 01:20:44,601
- It's probably just Mason, he's always

1138
01:20:44,601 --> 01:20:46,018
screwing with us.

1139
01:20:48,929 --> 01:20:50,687
Come on cowboy, don't worry.

1140
01:20:50,687 --> 01:20:52,020
I'll protect ya.

1141
01:20:56,297 --> 01:20:57,761
(eerie music)

1142
01:20:57,761 --> 01:20:58,594
Bastard.

1143
01:20:58,594 --> 01:20:59,681
- What?

1144
01:20:59,681 --> 01:21:00,612
- Not you.

1145
01:21:00,612 --> 01:21:04,112
The prick knows I don't like being scared.

1146
01:21:05,891 --> 01:21:08,064
Come on, screw them,
I'm freezing out here.

1147
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:09,397
- Wait a minute.

1148
01:21:10,549 --> 01:21:12,708
What the hell is that?

1149
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:15,208
(eerie music)

1150
01:21:31,874 --> 01:21:33,945
- Well, now what?

1151
01:21:33,945 --> 01:21:35,169
- I think we should make
a run for the other house.

1152
01:21:35,169 --> 01:21:36,633
Take a look at what's on that videotape.

1153
01:21:36,633 --> 01:21:37,554
- Are you out of your mind?

1154
01:21:37,554 --> 01:21:39,191
- Zack, do you think
that's such a good idea?

1155
01:21:39,191 --> 01:21:42,007
I mean, we shouldn't leave
Mason here like this.

1156
01:21:42,007 --> 01:21:43,142
- We'll just have to take him with us.

1157
01:21:43,142 --> 01:21:45,446
- That tape is not worth
risking our necks for.

1158
01:21:45,446 --> 01:21:46,973
We're safer here.

1159
01:21:46,973 --> 01:21:48,489
Why don't you look over
your notes or something?

1160
01:21:48,489 --> 01:21:50,117
- Yeah, isn't there
something in there that let's

1161
01:21:50,117 --> 01:21:52,097
us know how to get out of this place?

1162
01:21:52,097 --> 01:21:54,764
- That would be a bit difficult.

1163
01:21:57,571 --> 01:21:59,154
Since they're gone.

1164
01:22:00,324 --> 01:22:03,707
(sinister music)

1165
01:22:03,707 --> 01:22:04,851
Wouldn't happen to know
where my notes went

1166
01:22:04,851 --> 01:22:06,072
would you, Tyge?

1167
01:22:06,072 --> 01:22:07,362
- You accusing me of something?

1168
01:22:07,362 --> 01:22:10,768
- I just want my notes
back that you stole.

1169
01:22:10,768 --> 01:22:11,866
- Tyge, that's enough.

1170
01:22:11,866 --> 01:22:13,333
- I didn't steal your goddamn notes.

1171
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:14,518
Why the hell would I do that?

1172
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:16,101
- Maybe you didn't want us to leave.

1173
01:22:16,101 --> 01:22:18,101
(sighs)

1174
01:22:20,326 --> 01:22:23,621
- All right, maybe I did take your notes.

1175
01:22:23,621 --> 01:22:25,643
But I got one question for ya?

1176
01:22:25,643 --> 01:22:26,834
Did you happen to touch any of those rocks

1177
01:22:26,834 --> 01:22:28,417
you found upstairs?

1178
01:22:29,927 --> 01:22:31,777
- [Ashley] Zack?

1179
01:22:31,777 --> 01:22:34,151
- How very interesting.

1180
01:22:34,151 --> 01:22:35,657
You're one of them, aren't you?

1181
01:22:35,657 --> 01:22:37,203
Didn't you think any of us would think

1182
01:22:37,203 --> 01:22:39,476
of that possibility after
what happened to Deke?

1183
01:22:39,476 --> 01:22:40,831
- What the hell is he talking about?

1184
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:41,664
- He's a fucking liar.

1185
01:22:41,664 --> 01:22:42,987
- Oh come on, Ash, can't you
see what's going on here?

1186
01:22:42,987 --> 01:22:45,419
He's possessed and he's
trying to cover himself.

1187
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:46,540
He's been leading us around in circles

1188
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:48,056
since the first moment we got here.

1189
01:22:48,056 --> 01:22:49,537
- Shut your fucking mouth.

1190
01:22:49,537 --> 01:22:50,370
- Hey!

1191
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:51,203
(banging on door)

1192
01:22:51,203 --> 01:22:52,987
- [Jessica] Hello,
somebody there, anybody?

1193
01:22:52,987 --> 01:22:53,820
- Who's that?

1194
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:55,561
(Jessica screams)
- It's Jessica.

1195
01:22:55,561 --> 01:22:57,377
You gotta let her in.
- Okay, okay, shh.

1196
01:22:57,377 --> 01:22:58,367
Calm down, calm down.

1197
01:22:58,367 --> 01:22:59,200
We'll get it.
(Jessica bangs on door)

1198
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,426
- [Jessica] Somebody help me, please.

1199
01:23:00,426 --> 01:23:01,259
- We'll get her.

1200
01:23:01,259 --> 01:23:02,092
Tyge, come on.

1201
01:23:02,092 --> 01:23:03,517
(banging on door continues)

1202
01:23:03,517 --> 01:23:05,100
now, Tyge, come on.

1203
01:23:08,334 --> 01:23:10,834
(eerie music)

1204
01:23:12,327 --> 01:23:13,357
- Ash, we've got to do
something about this.

1205
01:23:13,357 --> 01:23:14,957
After what he just did in there,

1206
01:23:14,957 --> 01:23:15,790
who knows.

1207
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:16,929
What's her name, Zoe?

1208
01:23:16,929 --> 01:23:17,762
- Shut up.

1209
01:23:17,762 --> 01:23:21,243
- He might have killed that girl.

1210
01:23:21,243 --> 01:23:23,915
(banging on door continues)

1211
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:26,665
(sinister music)

1212
01:23:30,934 --> 01:23:32,361
Think about what you're doing, Ashley.

1213
01:23:32,361 --> 01:23:33,528
- [Jessica] Somebody please let me in.

1214
01:23:33,528 --> 01:23:34,361
- He'll kill us.

1215
01:23:34,361 --> 01:23:35,194
It's too late.

1216
01:23:35,194 --> 01:23:36,099
There's no other way.

1217
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:37,030
(growling)

1218
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:39,863
(Jessica screams)

1219
01:23:40,962 --> 01:23:43,712
(sinister music)

1220
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,842
(growls)

1221
01:24:37,842 --> 01:24:39,682
(Ashley screams)

1222
01:24:39,682 --> 01:24:40,714
- Block this door, block this door.

1223
01:24:40,714 --> 01:24:42,027
I gotta go get Zack and Mason.

1224
01:24:42,027 --> 01:24:44,277
- Hurry.

1225
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,559
- Come on, we have to go.

1226
01:24:47,559 --> 01:24:48,690
- [Zack] What's going on out there?

1227
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:50,096
- [Ashley] One of those
things got in the house.

1228
01:24:50,096 --> 01:24:51,173
Can you walk?

1229
01:24:51,173 --> 01:24:52,506
- I can make it.

1230
01:24:53,857 --> 01:24:56,440
(Tyge screams)

1231
01:24:58,380 --> 01:24:59,636
- Tyge.

1232
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:01,363
- Ashley, no.

1233
01:25:01,363 --> 01:25:02,749
(eerie music)

1234
01:25:02,749 --> 01:25:03,582
- Zoe!

1235
01:25:04,782 --> 01:25:07,120
(growling)

1236
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,037
- Move, go.

1237
01:25:11,038 --> 01:25:12,063
No lock on the door.

1238
01:25:12,063 --> 01:25:13,396
Get out of here.

1239
01:25:19,349 --> 01:25:20,182
Help me.

1240
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:29,956
Get out of the way.

1241
01:25:35,854 --> 01:25:36,937
We gotta find a screwdriver.

1242
01:25:36,937 --> 01:25:38,213
- How are you holding up?

1243
01:25:38,213 --> 01:25:40,046
- Dizzy but I'll live.

1244
01:25:46,144 --> 01:25:48,894
(menacing music)

1245
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:01,317
- Let's go, you okay, man?

1246
01:26:07,631 --> 01:26:08,464
- Tyge.

1247
01:26:10,905 --> 01:26:13,333
Tyge, where are you?

1248
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:14,166
Where the hell is he?

1249
01:26:14,166 --> 01:26:15,524
I left him right three.

1250
01:26:15,524 --> 01:26:17,729
- Forget about him, Ash, he's gone.

1251
01:26:17,729 --> 01:26:18,562
- No.

1252
01:26:24,915 --> 01:26:27,636
- Come on, let's go, let's go.

1253
01:26:27,636 --> 01:26:30,803
(slow sinister music)

1254
01:26:39,815 --> 01:26:42,550
(growling)

1255
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:44,883
- [Zack] Let's go, let's go.

1256
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:47,072
Down here.

1257
01:26:48,635 --> 01:26:51,051
Go ahead.

1258
01:26:51,051 --> 01:26:54,218
(slow sinister music)

1259
01:27:15,075 --> 01:27:16,765
(screaming)

1260
01:27:16,765 --> 01:27:18,010
- Jessica.

1261
01:27:18,010 --> 01:27:20,260
(growling)

1262
01:27:25,121 --> 01:27:26,704
Lee, stop, it's me.

1263
01:27:28,833 --> 01:27:30,159
- Look out.

1264
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:32,562
(Ashley screams in rage)

1265
01:27:32,562 --> 01:27:34,812
(growling)

1266
01:27:35,665 --> 01:27:38,415
(painful grunts)

1267
01:27:47,192 --> 01:27:49,442
(growling)

1268
01:27:51,597 --> 01:27:53,767
- Ashley, come on, there are more of them.

1269
01:27:53,767 --> 01:27:54,600
Ashley!

1270
01:28:00,892 --> 01:28:01,725
- Jessica!

1271
01:28:06,742 --> 01:28:08,242
- [Jessica] Mason.

1272
01:28:09,502 --> 01:28:10,335
Oh, my god.

1273
01:28:10,335 --> 01:28:11,936
What happened to you?

1274
01:28:11,936 --> 01:28:13,159
What's going on?

1275
01:28:13,159 --> 01:28:14,145
- It's okay, baby.

1276
01:28:14,145 --> 01:28:15,817
We're going to get out of this.

1277
01:28:15,817 --> 01:28:16,867
Everything's going to be all right.

1278
01:28:16,867 --> 01:28:18,700
Tell me what happened?

1279
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:22,951
- We were waiting for you.

1280
01:28:22,951 --> 01:28:25,247
I heard a noise out on the porch.

1281
01:28:25,247 --> 01:28:26,165
And we went out to see what it was

1282
01:28:26,165 --> 01:28:27,958
because we thought it was you and Lee

1283
01:28:27,958 --> 01:28:29,676
found a rock and we went back inside.

1284
01:28:29,676 --> 01:28:31,092
He started chasing me.

1285
01:28:31,092 --> 01:28:33,064
He's trying to kill me.

1286
01:28:33,064 --> 01:28:34,231
- [Mason] Shh.

1287
01:28:40,422 --> 01:28:41,710
- Why is he stopping?

1288
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:43,960
(growling)

1289
01:28:47,593 --> 01:28:50,817
(Jessica growls)

1290
01:28:50,817 --> 01:28:52,528
(yells in pain)

1291
01:28:52,528 --> 01:28:53,361
- Hey!

1292
01:28:57,895 --> 01:28:59,868
- [Zack] Dammit.

1293
01:28:59,868 --> 01:29:02,285
(Lee growls)

1294
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,900
- [Ashley] Jesus.

1295
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:06,777
- [Mason] Ashley!

1296
01:29:06,777 --> 01:29:08,054
(Lee growls)

1297
01:29:08,054 --> 01:29:11,004
(screaming)

1298
01:29:11,004 --> 01:29:12,504
- Ashley, come on.

1299
01:29:13,778 --> 01:29:17,940
(Mason continues screaming)

1300
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:21,273
(upbeat sinister music)

1301
01:29:24,581 --> 01:29:26,914
(screaming)

1302
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:36,970
(sinister music)

1303
01:30:11,377 --> 01:30:13,369
It's going numb.

1304
01:30:13,369 --> 01:30:15,502
- What the hell are we gonna do now?

1305
01:30:15,502 --> 01:30:16,718
- We got to get to the other house.

1306
01:30:16,718 --> 01:30:17,896
- Look, that video
tape's not going to work.

1307
01:30:17,896 --> 01:30:18,794
- I can fix it.

1308
01:30:18,794 --> 01:30:20,002
I can give it a shot at least.

1309
01:30:20,002 --> 01:30:20,907
(grunts)

1310
01:30:20,907 --> 01:30:21,740
We're out of options.

1311
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:22,726
Behind you!

1312
01:30:22,726 --> 01:30:24,893
(screams)

1313
01:30:28,326 --> 01:30:29,648
(growling)

1314
01:30:29,648 --> 01:30:32,398
(Ashley screams)

1315
01:30:34,197 --> 01:30:35,030
Ashley!

1316
01:30:39,646 --> 01:30:42,479
(Ashley whimpers)

1317
01:30:45,267 --> 01:30:46,100
- Help!

1318
01:30:53,955 --> 01:30:55,573
(sinister music)

1319
01:30:55,573 --> 01:30:57,823
(whimpers)

1320
01:31:16,914 --> 01:31:17,831
- You okay?

1321
01:31:18,928 --> 01:31:19,761
Ashley.

1322
01:31:21,169 --> 01:31:22,002
Ashley!

1323
01:31:23,088 --> 01:31:24,516
Are you okay?

1324
01:31:24,516 --> 01:31:26,017
- Yeah, I think so.

1325
01:31:26,017 --> 01:31:28,517
(low howling)

1326
01:31:41,061 --> 01:31:43,191
(upbeat macabre music)

1327
01:31:43,191 --> 01:31:44,191
- Get ready.

1328
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:05,630
(growling)

1329
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:12,234
Back door.

1330
01:32:25,544 --> 01:32:29,127
(upbeat suspenseful music)

1331
01:32:36,752 --> 01:32:37,585
Come on.

1332
01:32:58,709 --> 01:33:01,542
(banging on door)

1333
01:33:10,088 --> 01:33:12,338
(growling)

1334
01:33:15,025 --> 01:33:16,858
- Where are you going?

1335
01:33:23,283 --> 01:33:25,116
- Turn that light out.

1336
01:33:26,192 --> 01:33:30,192
Draw as little attention
to ourself as possible.

1337
01:33:41,591 --> 01:33:44,674
(slow macabre music)

1338
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:50,835
- What are you doing?

1339
01:33:50,835 --> 01:33:55,002
- I'm just performing a bit
of emergency surgery here.

1340
01:33:56,351 --> 01:34:00,351
Can you shine your
flashlight down here, please?

1341
01:34:05,919 --> 01:34:09,586
(banging on door continues)

1342
01:34:14,946 --> 01:34:17,196
(growling)

1343
01:34:55,202 --> 01:34:57,702
- Ashley I hope you find this.

1344
01:34:59,021 --> 01:35:01,250
I'm sorry I didn't talk to
you about all this before,

1345
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:03,997
but you wouldn't have
understood the things

1346
01:35:03,997 --> 01:35:05,830
that I saw that night.

1347
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:08,993
The gift that I was given.

1348
01:35:09,962 --> 01:35:13,045
But, the gift was never meant for me.

1349
01:35:17,691 --> 01:35:20,024
It was always meant for you.

1350
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:26,727
I was running out of time.

1351
01:35:26,727 --> 01:35:29,732
I knew that if I made
the ultimate sacrifice,

1352
01:35:29,732 --> 01:35:33,482
that you would eventually
find your way home.

1353
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:39,222
Of course, there is always the chance

1354
01:35:39,222 --> 01:35:41,661
that you move on with your life.

1355
01:35:41,661 --> 01:35:44,244
That you'd forget all about me.

1356
01:35:46,273 --> 01:35:49,440
But if you're watching this right now,

1357
01:35:51,813 --> 01:35:54,599
I know that you still
harbor the pain inside.

1358
01:35:54,599 --> 01:35:57,849
(loud banging on door)

1359
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:08,427
I love you, Ashley.

1360
01:36:20,743 --> 01:36:24,160
(slow suspenseful music)

1361
01:36:29,268 --> 01:36:31,018
- [Ashley] What do you
think she meant by that?

1362
01:36:31,018 --> 01:36:32,196
- What?

1363
01:36:32,196 --> 01:36:34,446
- The stuff about the gift.

1364
01:36:35,381 --> 01:36:37,744
What the hell does that mean?

1365
01:36:37,744 --> 01:36:39,435
- I don't know.

1366
01:36:39,435 --> 01:36:40,686
I try to figure all this out.

1367
01:36:40,686 --> 01:36:42,854
It doesn't make any sense.

1368
01:36:42,854 --> 01:36:43,687
I don't know why all this is happening

1369
01:36:43,687 --> 01:36:45,177
in the first place.

1370
01:36:45,177 --> 01:36:48,537
The demons, the possessions,
the invisible barriers.

1371
01:36:48,537 --> 01:36:51,840
There is no Cherokee elder descendant.

1372
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,030
And I always thought the cursed grounds

1373
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:55,481
were on my uncle's property.

1374
01:36:55,481 --> 01:36:56,778
So if that were the case--

1375
01:36:56,778 --> 01:36:58,408
- Then why is all this happening here?

1376
01:36:58,408 --> 01:37:00,492
- It doesn't add up.

1377
01:37:00,492 --> 01:37:02,768
- Hey, remember yesterday, when you said

1378
01:37:02,768 --> 01:37:05,148
that there must have been something inside

1379
01:37:05,148 --> 01:37:08,315
Mikki to make her go and kill herself?

1380
01:37:09,479 --> 01:37:12,743
Did you mean she was possessed?

1381
01:37:12,743 --> 01:37:13,576
- Oh shit.

1382
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:16,980
(growling)

1383
01:37:18,211 --> 01:37:20,224
If Mikki was possessed,
she managed to leave

1384
01:37:20,224 --> 01:37:23,242
my uncle's property,
that means the contagion

1385
01:37:23,242 --> 01:37:25,419
is no longer confined to those grounds.

1386
01:37:25,419 --> 01:37:26,797
It got out.

1387
01:37:26,797 --> 01:37:29,221
- So she could spread it to other places.

1388
01:37:29,221 --> 01:37:31,288
- When she bled all over the farm,

1389
01:37:31,288 --> 01:37:34,526
she spread the contagion to that land.

1390
01:37:34,526 --> 01:37:36,389
So that if a descendant
from her bloodline,

1391
01:37:36,389 --> 01:37:39,137
in this case, you, steps onto that land--

1392
01:37:39,137 --> 01:37:40,470
- Trap goes off.

1393
01:37:41,313 --> 01:37:43,212
How can we get out of this, Zack?

1394
01:37:43,212 --> 01:37:45,097
How do we stop this?

1395
01:37:45,097 --> 01:37:47,847
- I know the story is incomplete,

1396
01:37:48,858 --> 01:37:50,650
the last thing my uncle
told me before he died

1397
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:52,525
was that he made some new translations

1398
01:37:52,525 --> 01:37:53,497
that he would sit down and talk with me

1399
01:37:53,497 --> 01:37:55,553
about them when he had some free time.

1400
01:37:55,553 --> 01:37:57,343
After the murders, when
I finally got my hands

1401
01:37:57,343 --> 01:38:00,657
on his notes, some of the
pages had been ripped out.

1402
01:38:00,657 --> 01:38:02,817
- The pages Mikki was burning?

1403
01:38:02,817 --> 01:38:04,291
(banging)

1404
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:06,541
(growling)

1405
01:38:09,619 --> 01:38:11,930
There has to be a way out of here.

1406
01:38:11,930 --> 01:38:13,930
There's got to be a way.

1407
01:38:19,441 --> 01:38:22,024
- My uncle did tell me one way.

1408
01:38:23,673 --> 01:38:25,665
He said if there's no one left alive

1409
01:38:25,665 --> 01:38:28,860
on the cursed ground,
then the barriers crumble

1410
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:31,527
and the demons go back to sleep.

1411
01:38:32,868 --> 01:38:36,004
Yeah, I don't like that
option much either.

1412
01:38:36,004 --> 01:38:37,264
- Where in the hell are you going?

1413
01:38:37,264 --> 01:38:38,097
- Garage.

1414
01:38:38,097 --> 01:38:39,027
I can get a weapon there.

1415
01:38:39,027 --> 01:38:39,860
Coming?

1416
01:38:41,924 --> 01:38:43,062
Look, it doesn't make any sense for us

1417
01:38:43,062 --> 01:38:43,895
to stay here.

1418
01:38:43,895 --> 01:38:46,101
You know they're going to
find us here eventually.

1419
01:38:46,101 --> 01:38:47,544
If we're going to beat this thing,

1420
01:38:47,544 --> 01:38:49,586
we've got to stop running.

1421
01:38:49,586 --> 01:38:50,503
So come on.

1422
01:38:51,378 --> 01:38:54,378
(suspenseful music)

1423
01:40:04,703 --> 01:40:06,453
- [Ashley] Over here.

1424
01:40:15,457 --> 01:40:16,457
There it is.

1425
01:40:33,353 --> 01:40:34,436
What's wrong?

1426
01:40:37,973 --> 01:40:38,806
- Dammit.

1427
01:40:40,437 --> 01:40:41,464
- What's going on, Zack?

1428
01:40:41,464 --> 01:40:42,964
What's the matter?

1429
01:40:45,883 --> 01:40:47,207
Zack?

1430
01:40:47,207 --> 01:40:49,707
- I need you to do me a favor.

1431
01:40:51,165 --> 01:40:51,998
- Okay.

1432
01:40:51,998 --> 01:40:54,469
- I need you to kill me.

1433
01:40:54,469 --> 01:40:55,302
- What?

1434
01:40:55,302 --> 01:40:56,415
What the fuck are you talking about?

1435
01:40:56,415 --> 01:40:57,248
That's not funny.

1436
01:40:57,248 --> 01:40:59,101
- My uncle was right.

1437
01:40:59,101 --> 01:41:00,646
He was right about me.

1438
01:41:00,646 --> 01:41:02,134
When I found those rocks in the bedroom

1439
01:41:02,134 --> 01:41:05,220
upstairs, I couldn't believe it.

1440
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:07,120
You've looked for something
like that your whole life

1441
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:11,287
and then, it's so surreal, it
was fantastic, you know, I...

1442
01:41:16,838 --> 01:41:20,421
After Deke, I knew it
was a matter of time.

1443
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,207
I can feel it.

1444
01:41:28,563 --> 01:41:31,146
It's like a sickness inside me.

1445
01:41:33,341 --> 01:41:34,674
It's everywhere.

1446
01:41:38,965 --> 01:41:40,215
Do it, Ash.

1447
01:41:40,215 --> 01:41:42,382
- Zack, please, there
has to be another way.

1448
01:41:42,382 --> 01:41:44,411
- There is not other way,
I can't fight it anymore.

1449
01:41:44,411 --> 01:41:46,432
Please, Ash.
- I can't do it.

1450
01:41:46,432 --> 01:41:48,557
We have to find another way.
- Ash!

1451
01:41:48,557 --> 01:41:49,390
Kill me!

1452
01:41:51,057 --> 01:41:54,807
Don't let me become like
one of them, please.

1453
01:41:56,351 --> 01:41:57,184
Please.

1454
01:41:58,397 --> 01:41:59,230
Kill me.

1455
01:42:07,341 --> 01:42:08,174
- I can't.

1456
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:29,035
Zack.

1457
01:42:29,035 --> 01:42:30,702
Where are you going?

1458
01:42:44,739 --> 01:42:46,489
- Oh, I'll be damned.

1459
01:42:47,487 --> 01:42:48,570
- What is it?

1460
01:42:49,444 --> 01:42:50,944
What did you find?

1461
01:42:52,297 --> 01:42:53,130
Zack.

1462
01:42:56,765 --> 01:42:57,598
(Zack growls)

1463
01:42:57,598 --> 01:42:58,431

1464
01:43:03,304 --> 01:43:04,554
Tyge, look out.

Oh god!
