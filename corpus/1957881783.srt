are actually waiting to
get into this country?

00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:46,350

way to the border, Jeremy.

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,183
Thank you very much.

00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:48,810

00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,193
This is gay, isn't it?

00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:52,176
- Totally bites, man.
- This is gay.

00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:53,090
- Yeah, I know.

00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,530
I thought we were gonna find some chicks

00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,390
and give 'em a spray.

00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,540
- Look guys, I'm sorry.

00:01:58,495 --> 00:01:59,770
I thought dad was going driving me back.

00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,543
- Your dad's too busy
banging every babe in town.

00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:05,250
- Shut up. You understand that?

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,100
Shut the hell up.

00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:11,158
- Look, I don't see why we
just don't let him out here.

00:02:11,158 --> 00:02:13,603
I mean, what the hell are we
gonna do in Windsor anyway?

(car honks)

00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,960
- Now listen Jeremy, do not tell dad

00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,790
I didn't take you all the way, all right?

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,290
He'll just say I'm not being a
good enough brother and shit.

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,280

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,010
I don't wanna be doing
this every weekend, Jeremy.

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,860
I'm not your chauffeur.

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,610
You're the one that wanted
to live with mom in Canada.

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,763

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,423

Two different cars, bus, now bike.

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,320

00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,703

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,770
You buy these in Detroit, son,

00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,800
so you could sell 'em in Windsor?

00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,930
- No.

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,380
They're for me, I'm a runner.

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,650
- Well, I know you like
to run back and forth

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,603
across the border.

00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,200
Which school do you go to?

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,513
- Wilfred Laurier High.

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,980
- You're on the track team?

00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,753
- Yeah.

00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,423
Well, I'm trying out.

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,650
- Help me out here.

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,240
What else are you hiding?

00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,290
- Nothing!

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,490
- I could strip search you.

00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,707
I find something, I'll make you wish

00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:16,220
you never set foot in God's country.

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,420
- Search me if you want.

00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,670
- That won't be necessary. You can go.

00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:30,250
So what is it, Mr. Jeremy
Walling, born in the USA?

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,330
- [Jeremy] What's what?

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,160
- [Cap] Well, most young
Americans are crossing the border

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,330
as much as you are, are running a scam.

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,163
What's yours?

00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:39,690
- [Jeremy] I got parents on both sides.

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,653
- [Cap] That's original.

00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:06,313
Almost.

00:05:06,313 --> 00:05:08,077
Oh come on!

00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:10,244
(panting)

00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:26,459
(phone ringing)

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,153
- Hello?

00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:34,620
- Ben, it's almost eight o'clock.

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,453
Where is he?

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,880
- Buddy took him home
a couple of hours ago.

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,560
They're probably stuck
in traffic, Sunday night.

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,460
- Is Buddy coming?

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,660
- Yeah, I wanted him to see you.

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,900
I thought that would make you happy.

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,930
- Oh, right.

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,960
I guess you're just too
busy seeing how many times

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,070
45 goes into 22 to drive him yourself.

00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,903
- Was that dad?

00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:55,450
I promised I'd call when I got back in.

00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,600
Tell him I'm all right.

00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,433
- You tell him.

00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,223
Is Buddy here?

00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,203
- No.

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,233
- Make it short.

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,543
- Hey, dad.

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,610
- Jeremy.

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,210
- Thanks for the weekend.

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,960
- Listen, you like the
running shoes and the bike?

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,270
- Yeah, yeah. They're great.

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,430
- 'cause we could take
'em back if you don't.

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,870
We can get something else.

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,113
- No, no, I like them. They're fine.

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,420
Yeah.

00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,253
Okay.

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,610
Well, I gotta go.

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,940
So, I'll talk to you soon.

00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,393
- I'll see you Friday and
you stay strong, all right?

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,750
- Bye.

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,583
- Yeah, bye.

(Beth screams)

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,273
- Feel better?

00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:09,843
- Yeah.

00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,090
Yeah.

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,590
Yeah, like a whole new person.

00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,350
Glory be, everything seems beautiful

00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,480
in its own way, Mr. Dickens.

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,240
Could I go back to study hall
or lunch early to reflect?

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,110
- Oh, no. You had a breakthrough, Beth.

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,840
I asked you to imagine your
father starring in your dream.

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,820
You screamed, that was good.

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,723
Now, tell the group
what you were thinking.

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,870
- Nothing.

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,650
I'm on a diet. I was
trying to burn calories.

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,840
- [Mr. Dickens] Oh, Beth.

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,070
- [Beth] No, it is not funny.

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,090
My dad split because my mom's
butt got bigger than his.

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,840
It is the biggest cause of divorce.

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,830
- [Mr. Dickens] I think it's usually

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,873
a little more complicated than that.

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,823
Horace.

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,520
- [Horace] Well, I was
supposed to go with my mom

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,780
down to Florida this weekend,

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,900
but my dad wants me to
spend some quality time

00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,860
with Karen's daughters.

00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,463
- Oh, excuse me, are you joining us?

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,680
- Yeah, I guess so.

00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,470
I'm Jeremy Walling.

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,030
- Oh, of course. Wow!

00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,023
Don't be shy.

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,510
Pull up a pew.

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,570
Now, Jeremy's just transferred to Laurier.

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,550
How long have you been here, Jeremy?

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,100
- Since Thanksgiving.

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,370
American Thanksgiving. End of November.

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,203
- Well, that's good.

00:08:20,203 --> 00:08:21,910
Well, I'm Mr. Dickens,
and we'll just go round

00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,293
and introduce ourselves.

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,253
- Co-host, Cathy Lee.

00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:28,612
- Guylain?

00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:31,467
- Guylain.

00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,543
- Oh, I'm Quinn.

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,003
- Horace, with a C.

00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:40,838
- Hey.

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,840
- Mikey.

00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,750
- And this is our little sleeping beauty,

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,580
and her name is...

00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,150
- What?

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,480
Oh, my name's Rachel with an R.

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,950
- And as I said, I'm Mr. Dickens,

00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,654
and I have a master's
degree in family counseling.

00:08:57,654 --> 00:08:59,890
And this is our chat group.

00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:04,610
This is a place where you
can just let it all hang out.

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,540
All the students here

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,073
have the exact same problems as you do.

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,730
So Jeremy, are your
parents actually divorced?

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,563
- Almost.

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,416
Can I just sort of watch for awhile?

00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,803
- Oh no, absolutely.

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,690
Right, group.

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,663
What's the first thing that we learn here?

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,020
- [All] We are not alone.

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,820
- [Mr. Dickens] Once more with gusto.

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,257
- [All] We are not alone.

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,073
- And for the sake of my government grant.

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,650
- Well, let's hear someone else speak.

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,575
Guylain, did you see
your father this weekend?

00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:46,410
(Guylain whimpers)

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,243
Oh.

00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:49,833
Oh, not again.

00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,750
Oh, that's right.

00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,040
Let it all out.

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,290
Let it all out.

00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:57,502
He's a bad man.

00:09:58,682 --> 00:09:59,932
He's a bad man.

00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:02,586
Say it after me.

00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:05,484
He's a bad man.
- He's a bad man.

00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:06,670
- Yes.

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,337
He's a bad man.
- He's a bad man.

00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:14,680
- Hey, Gap guy.

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,513
You're American?

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,550
- Yeah, that's right.

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,680
I spell color without
U and I get a B for it.

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,820
I never got a B in my life.

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,800
- Wow! Color me impressed.

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,970
- Look, sorry. I'm just pissed.

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,310
Mad or whatever.

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,660
- Hey, it's okay to say
pissed in Canada, hey.

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,780
After hockey, getting loaded
is like our national pastime.

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,823
My name is Beth. Rhymes with Beth.

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,740
- Sweet.

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,113
- You're Jeremy. I heard.

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,880
So, a lot of people think that Americans

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,350
are pushy, obnoxious cretins

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,833
who come to Canada to rape and pillage.

00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,220
- Well, what do you think?

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,863
- I'm into rape and pillage.

00:10:52,824 --> 00:10:54,440
(laughs)

00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,833
Actually, I'm an ancient
history buff freak.

00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,250
As you can tell from the happy hour,

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,500
some people think the glass is half empty.

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,410
some people think it's half full.

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,070
With me, there's no glass.

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,050
- What's the happy hour?

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,720
- Mr. Dickens' rap
session for damaged goods.

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,927
CoDs. Children of divorce.

00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:14,140
- So, why do you go if
you hate it so much?

00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,310
- It's only Mondays and Fridays.

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,280
You get credit, and sometimes the stories

00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,330
from the other losers in the group

00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,113
help so that I forget to eat lunch.

00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,700
So why'd your parents split?

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,070
- What do you think?

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,350
- Unselfish mom, tired
of being Holly home maker

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,750
decides to let her true soul gush forth.

00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,430
Take a younger, richer
lover, male or female.

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,920
Close?

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,753
- Not really.

00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:42,340
It's more like your wide butt theory.

00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,493
- Men can be pus.

00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,920
Hey, your dad's probably
thrilled that you're not home

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
so he can screw his brains out in piece.

00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,853
- No, actually.

00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,103
He wants me to live with him in Detroit.

00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,035
- Aren't you lucky?

00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,618
(bell ringing)

00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:04,974
(gentle music)

00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:16,070
- Got any gun, man?

00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:18,550
- What, a gun? Me?

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,430
- Not gun, gum.

00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,263
Like a chewing.

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,483
- Oh! Well, these are
asthma time capsules.

00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,033
Forget it.

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,101
- I understand, man.

00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:31,710
I get hay fever too, don't you know?

00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,950
I'm Kellog.

00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,020
- Jeremy. Nice to meet you.

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,623
- Next! Name and event, please.

00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,300
- Jeremy Walling, 400 meter.

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,693
That's W-A-L-

00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:43,323
- L-L-I-N-G.

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,113
Born in the USA, has asthma. I remember.

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,580
- No way. You work at customs.

00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,900
You can't be coach.

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,733
- Well, we're even then.

00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:55,320
Because you have $150 track
shoes and can't run the 400.

00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,153
- Why not?

00:12:56,153 --> 00:12:57,630
- Because it's too damn difficult.

00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,360
It's one continuous sprint.

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,710
You need muscles, power and
better lungs than you got, son.

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,780
- No, no, I can do it.

00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,103
I have in the States.

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,053
- Try a cross country, all right.

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,260
- What about my sweatshirt?
When do I get one?

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,210
- Not till you make the team. Move on.

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,216
Next.

00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:17,799
(both panting)

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,400
Oh, Jesus.

00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,980
No, no. Don't stop it.

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,750
Let him get a visit from
uncle Charlie tonight.

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,837
That'll teach him.

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,853
- No, don't file that until
we see what Ben is up to.

00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,440
I don't wanna rush the sale of the house

00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,980
until I know I've got half of the business

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,853
and primary custody of Jeremy.

00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,033
What? Florida for spring break?

00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,373
No way, Kevin.

00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,740
I don't need any of mom
and dad's negativity.

00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,570
I just visited them in September

00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,303
and I still had a husband then.

00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,640
Kevin, be a good brother.

00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,923
Just be my lawyer.

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,633
Thanks. Love you too.

00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,757
Sweetie, I've got a surprise for you.

00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,330
- I'm busy, mom.

00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,663
- Oh, come on.

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,040
I got you ice cream.

00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,250
The kind you like.

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,083
Double strawberry.

00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,520
- Is it Ben & Jerry's?
'cause I love Ben & Jerry's.

00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,410
- Can you please stop saying the name Ben?

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,763
Stop saying the name Ben.

00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,493
Get the bowls.

00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:43,057
(Jeremy groans)

00:14:43,057 --> 00:14:45,010
Oh my God. What happened to you?

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:45,860
- It's all right.

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,813
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:50,070
- What is it? Did you hurt yourself?

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,903
- It's just a Charlie horse.

00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:51,920
I think I overdid it at practice.

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,950
It's all right.

00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:56,000
- I do not need this stress in my life.

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,513
The solution is simple, no track.

00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,310
- It's gonna be all right
in the morning, mom.

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,320
Don't worry about it.

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,590
- Excuse me.

00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,860
If you don't get all As, it's my fault.

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,290
If you don't get into a good college

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,790
with a Canadian diploma,
he'll blame it on me.

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,040
He'll tell the court I'm
limiting your future.

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,873
- He will not.

00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,580
- Oh, stop defending him.

00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,040
He just wants you to go
live with him and Buddy,

00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,700
like a bunch of guys in a damn beer ad.

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,000
And he'll tell you how
special his first wife was.

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,280
How the hell am I supposed
to follow that act?

00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,070
She died in childbirth.

00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,180
Gimme a break.

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,884
- Just have some faith, all right?

00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:34,717
- See?

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,500
He's poisoned Buddy against me.

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,480
Buddy never visits, never
returns my phone calls,

00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,800
doesn't care if I'm alive.

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,280
He may not be my natural son,

00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,683
but I've raised him like one, goddammit!

00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,210
Your father cheated me

00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,683
out of everything I've built for 17 years.

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,473
But he's not gonna get you, baby.

00:16:05,686 --> 00:16:07,186
- I'm staying with track, mom.

00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,303
- Fine.

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,013
That's just what he wants.

00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,030
- What about my Ben & Jerry's?

00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,300
(gentle music)

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,313
My mom's just going through a hard time.

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,300
She thinks everyone's
against her, and I'm not,

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,253
but it just keeps getting harder.

00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,223
- In what way?

00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,010
- Well, I wish she just
would forgive my dad.

00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,670
- What did he do?

00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,300
- Stab in the dark here.

00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,429
He cheated on her, huh?

00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:08,670
He broke a sacred oath for a cheap hump

00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,670
with a size two stranger.

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,510
- Let him speak, Beth.

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,600
This is very difficult for Jeremy.

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,713
- No, not really.

00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,320
My dad explained it to me and
I've thought about it a lot.

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,723
They just grew apart.

00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,240
The love just stopped.

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,020
- There's no such thing as love.

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,380
There is mutual self-interest.

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,530
And when he lost interest,
he cheated on her.

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,770
- Beth, shh.

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,423
- It's okay. She's right.

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,630
My mom caught him with one of her friends.

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,150
- Women can be pus.

00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,313
- Beth, zip it.

00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:49,950
- At least it wasn't a cousin.

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,113
- Perhaps she cheated on him.

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,833
- No, no, no.

00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,920
She wouldn't do that.

00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,753
She's loyal.

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,813
- Do you think that your parents'
relationship was working?

00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,720
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,090
I mean up until a few months ago,

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,253
and then my brother just came
to me and said it was over.

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,230
- Did he beat you when he found out?

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,180
- No.

00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,960
- Did he start doing drugs?

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,050
Specifically, meth?

00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,760
- No. He doesn't even drink.

00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,970
They're both great.

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,420
- But when your mother packed
up and took you to Windsor,

00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,743
you wanted to stay with
your father, correct?

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,643
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:32,020
(bell rings)

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,013
- Well, that's all very interesting stuff.

00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,363
Listen, I hope you all
have a fabulous weekend.

00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:49,233
And remember, nothing cures
the blues like a good hug.

00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,710
Are you waiting for me, Beth?

00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,840
- Not likely.

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,100
(both laugh)

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,333
- Have a great weekend.

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,802
- Hey.

00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:05,635
If your dad's so great,

00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:07,810
why don't you go live with the hard-on?

00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,120
- Well, dad's got Buddy.

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,951
Mom doesn't have anybody.

00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:13,330
- Well, so in other words, you care.

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,340
- Yeah, of course I care.

00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,800
She's my mother.

00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,710
- Well, are you helping her?

00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,883
What's the money situation like?

00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:20,090
- It's bad.

00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,350
She wants more than he's offering.

00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,183
- That's new.

00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,880
I got my mother another 200 bucks a month

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,563
by threatening to tell
daddy's bimbos he had crabs.

00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,821
- That's pretty disgusting.

00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:31,930
(both chuckle)

00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,763
- No, it's not.

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,468
What's disgusting is he had
the money the whole time.

00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:39,051

I don't wanna be confrontational here.

00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,360
I'm just saying, this a little bit odd.

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,210
I mean, you've only been here 20 minutes.

00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,330
You've already called your mother once.

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,090
You gotta call her 10
wide. What happens next?

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,420
Does that coach turn into
a pumpkin at midnight?

00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,970
Just tell your mother
that you're sleeping over

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,840
at your girlfriend's house tonight.

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,450
- Ben.
- No, it's ridiculous.

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,373
You're 23 years old. You
deserve your own life.

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,440
What are you doing here?

00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,173
- Well...

00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,600
- Did you meet Sandy?

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,260
Sandy, this is Jeremy. Jeremy, Sandy.

00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,433
Jeremy's my other son.

00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,490
Sandy, would you wait
outside for a minute?

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,323
Would you?

00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:34,156
- What?

00:21:34,156 --> 00:21:35,203
- Outside? Okay.

00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,131
Just go down the hall, make a right.

00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:41,453
It's in the garage.

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,363
She's great.

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,920
Didn't your mother tell you

00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,330
to come over here tomorrow morning?

00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,840
- I never went home.

00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,400
I came right from practice.

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,670
I ran all the way from the bus terminal.

00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,020
Hey, what do you think?

00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,230
I made the team.

00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,583
- Hey, that's great.

00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,599
That's terrific. I'm proud of you.

00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:07,432
Good.

00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,260
- So, where are you going, dad?

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,040
- Printer's union ball.

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,690
I gotta make an appearance.
You know, management.

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,523
I'm already late.

00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:17,710
I just, your mother...

00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,228
I can't believe she
didn't tell you that...

00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:21,550
She couldn't just call the school up.

00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,709
Say, "Hello. My son..."

00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:24,542
- Well, just forget it.

00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,180
I mean, I can go back.

00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,958
- No, of course not.

00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:28,791
What are you talkin'...

00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:29,624
Make yourself at...

00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:30,620
Make yourself at home. This is your home.

00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,660
It's still your home.
Here, take off your pack.

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,767
We got a pizza going in the oven.

00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:35,780
You can watch the satellite.

00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,760
I told Buddy that Rocco
and Hayes can stay here.

00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,960
So three of you, or the four of you.

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,210
You hang out, you have
some fun and rock and roll.

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,400
Hey, rip up the joint. I don't care.

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,393
Take your coat off.

00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,248
It looks good.

00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:53,610
(car honks)

00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,500
She's really great.

00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,350
You'll see, when we're
the three of us all.

00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,587
Four, you know?

00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:01,520
I'm not gonna be late.

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,353
- See ya.

00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:10,239
(upbeat music)
- You know

00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,322
I am the man.

00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:14,279
Who's your mob?

00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,703
- Hey, guys.

00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:25,125
- What are you doing here, doofus?

00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,530
- I didn't know dad had a date.

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,430
- Yeah, what is she? In ninth grade?

00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,263
- Shut up!

00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,050
What's with that sorry sweatshirt?

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,743
Laurier track?

00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,170
That is so ghetto, Jeremy.

00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,810
- Yeah, so faggy.

00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,530
- Not as faggy as three
guys working out together

00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,620
in their underwear.

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,850
- Does that excite you? Huh?

00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,130
You like that?

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,080
- Shut up.

00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,760
- Well, there's only one
way to find out, guys.

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,657
Pants him.

00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,130
- Hey, guys, chill, chill.

00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,050
Forget him.

00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,400
Cool down, doofus. They're
just horsing around.

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,520
- Jesus, what did you do that for?

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,204
- Buddy, I'm really sorry.

00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:08,553
I didn't mean to.

00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:10,065
- Oh, you're dead.

00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:11,648
You stupid bastard!

00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,259
You're not even supposed to be here.

00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:17,623
Stupid bastard.

00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,765
- Get off of him, man. He's your brother.

00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:22,428
- Half brother! Half brother!

00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:25,261
(Jeremy wheezing)

00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,149
- [Hayes] Oh my God.
He's having an attack.

00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:29,312
Get his inhaler.

00:24:29,312 --> 00:24:30,428
Get his inhaler!

00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,178
- You stupid bastard!

00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:46,340
- You okay, man?

00:24:53,981 --> 00:24:56,564

Hey, hey, yo, yo, what's going on in here?

00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,150
- The weather is braking.
Get a good night's sleep.

00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:35,173
Tomorrow at 7:00 a.m., we
bring out the starting blocks.

00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,810
Gentlemen, have a good evening.

00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,710
- Who is that guy?

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,810
- He's my track coach.

00:25:49,668 --> 00:25:52,073
- What's your math teacher? A Mountie?

00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:10,384
- I'll see ya.

00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,137
- Hey, come on. Let's talk a little.

00:26:15,137 --> 00:26:16,865
- Dad, dad, dad. What are you doing?

00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:18,280
- I wanna get a couple of Havanas.

00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,430
Just, I'll be back in a second.

00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,263
- Hurry up.

00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:22,190
I don't want her seeing
me waiting out here.

00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,393
- Well, then get back in the car.

00:26:40,877 --> 00:26:43,460
(somber music)

00:26:56,017 --> 00:26:58,070
Hi there, you got any Cubans?

00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,677
- [Man] Yeah, very good, sir.

00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:02,351
- What is that?

00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:03,730
- Well, it's like Canadian M&Ms.

00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,850
It's just as good.

00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,950
- Put it down. Come here.

00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,683
Look, Jeremy, I don't want
you getting too involved here.

00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,370
Well, you may be moving back real soon.

00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,990
I'm pushing for an earlier
court date. Maybe next month.

00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,210
You could be back at John Glenn

00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,800
before, I don't know, spring break.

00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,633
- Really?

00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:21,466
- Yeah.

00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:23,810
Which is why I don't want
you getting too wrapped up

00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,570
with this whole Canadian team.

00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,733
I think it might be better
if you drop out now.

00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:31,300
- Dad, I thought you'd be proud of me.

00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,133
- I am.

00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:35,170
I just don't want you making
any emotional commitments

00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,090
when ultimately you're
gonna be moving back in

00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,003
with Buddy and me.

00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,570
- I know, I know.

00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,700
God, you're being bounced back and forth

00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,160
like a ping pong ball, I'm sorry.

00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,200
But that's all the more
reason to stay focused.

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,033
I mean, look at this.

00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:50,866
Look, what...

00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:54,143
This is not M&Ms.

00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:55,440
This is an Astro.

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,850
And what is this? Mr. Big?

00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:02,850
It's like a knockoff of a Baby Ruth.

00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,340
Even Canadian football, it's all so fake.

00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,490
It's like a bunch of wannabes.

00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,850
Jeremy, you are the real deal.

00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,670
You are first rate.

00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,080
All of this, it's second rate.

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,080
It's like a cheap imitation of
what we are, of what you are.

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,910
- Anyway, at least you
can buy Cubans here.

00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,390
- Yeah, but have you taken a look

00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,553
at the fruitcake who's selling them?

00:28:30,553 --> 00:28:33,136
(both chuckle)

00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:37,070
- You know, I don't know why
you hate Canada so much, dad.

00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,963
- Jeremy, I was married here.

00:28:41,642 --> 00:28:44,225
(gentle music)

00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,363
- Where's Walling?

00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,693
- No, thanks.

00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,190
So I guess you're off your diet.

00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,030
- Yeah, it's my mother's fault.

00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,220
She found out there are
men who like fat women.

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,690
They're called chubby chasers. (laughs)

00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,810
- Beth, you're not fat.

00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,450
- Well, not yet.

00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,283
And not that it matters.

00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:19,310
Have you heard the sad statistics
on CoD success stories?

00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,290
Three out of four of us
will be dysfunctional

00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,040
throughout our adult lives,
at best, borderline normal.

00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,993
- Great.

00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:28,000
(Mr. Dickens whistling)

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,410
- Hello, everybody.

00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,810
I had a pretty good
weekend. I hope you all did.

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,910
Who's gonna start today?

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,793
Guylain.

00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,393
- My father, he was arrested.

00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:43,406
(all applauding)

00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,490
- But when the needles all came home,

00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,563
that's when I bail.

00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,933
Split, right there and there.

00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,130
- That was really clever
of you to say no, Quinn.

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,794
Let's have a round of applause for Quinn.

00:30:05,794 --> 00:30:08,544
(all applauding)

00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,713
Jeremy, how was your weekend?

00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,750
- Well, my father informed me

00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,410
that I'll be transferring
back to my old school.

00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,670
He's gonna get primary custody.

00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,033
So I guess I'm not gonna
be here very much longer.

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,570
- Get your head out of your ass, Jeremy.

00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,110
What judge is gonna give you over to a dad

00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,900
who cheats with his mom's friend?

00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,800
He'll be lucky to get weekend visitation.

00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,970
Unless of course he can prove
that your mother is unfit.

00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,680
Namely, is an alcoholic, a drug addict

00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,180
or sleeps with total strangers.

00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,620
And for that, he would have
to hire a private investigator

00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,010
and produce evidence.

00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,515
- I don't think he would do that.

00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:46,340
- Yeah, that's what I thought
about my daddy dearest

00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,870
until this hard ass PI
on the witness stand

00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,030
started showing pictures of my mom

00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,570
trolling singles bars in a miniskirt.

00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,842
Luckily, my mother had
also hired a private eye

00:30:54,842 --> 00:30:57,823
and got my dad in a hot tub
with an underage hooker.

00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,196
He didn't even get every weekend.

00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:04,010
(bell ringing)

00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,570
- Well, that was very,
very positive today.

00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,000
Yep.

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,793
I shall see you all on Friday.

00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:21,670
- Listen hey, sorry that
I attacked you there.

00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:25,167
Just, I don't wanna see you go, you know?

00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,059
- Yeah, I know.

00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,059
I better go.

00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,485
I'll see you later, all right?

00:31:33,485 --> 00:31:34,318
- Okay.

00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:41,880
- You wanted to see me?

00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,007
- Yeah. Come on, have a seat.

00:31:45,365 --> 00:31:47,815
Guys, do you wanna give
us a moment here, please?

00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,593
Thank you.

00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,910
You missed practice without an excuse.

00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,240
You wanna be a part of this team?

00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,630
- I don't have a choice here, Cap.

00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,220
You know, I might be
moving back to Detroit.

00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,480
I'd have to quit midway.

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,593
- Yeah, but you're bailing
anyway, aren't you?

00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,940
Yeah.

00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,773
You know, when you told me

00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:14,143
you were a 400 meters sprinter, I laughed.

00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,683
But then I got watching you.

00:32:16,683 --> 00:32:18,930
I saw that crazy look in your eyes.

00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,130
And I said to myself,
here's this mixed up,

00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,350
talented kid who understands obstacles,

00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,270
been battling his whole life.

00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,323
Maybe I can help him become a champion.

00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:31,830
- I'm not in control here.

00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,930
My parents are fighting over me.

00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,688
What do you want me to do about it?

00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:36,088
- I want you to be a winner.

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,302
Give them something to fight about.

00:32:38,302 --> 00:32:40,885
(gentle music)

00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:49,713
No, no, come on, back.

00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,100
Stay down through your
first couple of strides.

00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,530
Get your hands up quick.

00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,480
It'll bring you up.

00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,060
Good balance.
- Hands up quick?

00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,650
- Yeah, have good grade.

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,873
Pick it up a little bit more.

00:33:04,873 --> 00:33:05,706
And...

00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,020
That's it. You got it.

00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,203
Get off the track.

00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,870
- You invite a man to come
over and eat promptly at six,

00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,480
and he shows up almost an hour late.

00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,790
It's insulting.

00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,840
I wanted to meet him.

00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:41,817
(doorbell dings)

00:33:41,817 --> 00:33:42,793
- It's Jeremy.

00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:49,430
Come on in.

00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,270
Hi.

00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,937
I'll take your coat.

00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,523
Okay. That's it.

00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,100
- Jeremy, I've heard all about you.

00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,933
- Hi.

00:34:06,842 --> 00:34:08,400
I hope I'm not late.

00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,710
- No, no.

00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,543
Unfortunately, my mother was just leaving.

00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,490
- Yes. I have a law class at the college.

00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,220
- My mother's taking a
computer course there.

00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,010
- [Mom] Oh, good for her.

00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:22,580
Sorry to hear your parents
are getting a divorce.

00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,300
- Yeah. Well, you know?

00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,800
- Listen, if she wants to call me,

00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,330
tell her I man a divorce hotline,

00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,410
I know all the tricks for the trial.

00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,700
You can never be too prepared.

00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,533
- Or too thin.

00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:37,366
(mom chuckles)

00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:42,860
- Bye.

00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,693
- Bye.

00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,800
Oh, I'm sorry. I screwed up.

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,270
I thought you wanted me here at 6:45.

00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,770
- I did.

00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:53,353
(gentle music)

00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,477
- Never saw you as a gourmet cook.

00:35:08,477 --> 00:35:11,460
- [Beth] Well, you know...

00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,140
- Or is that a recipe of the Visigoths

00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,323
or the ancient Romans or something?

00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,430
- [Beth] Actually pasta was invented

00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,583
by this barbarian chief named Boy-R-Dee.

00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:27,233
He might've been a chef.

00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:30,939
I hope you left room for dessert.

- Jeremy, you ruined it.

00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:09,373
- I just wanted to give you a hand.

00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,423
- I just bought it for you.

00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,990
Am I turning you off?

00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,510
- No.

00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,027
No.

00:36:21,027 --> 00:36:22,820
- I look chunky?

00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,943
- Absolutely not.

00:36:25,856 --> 00:36:27,023
- I thought...

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,340
Don't you like me?

00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,083
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

00:36:34,223 --> 00:36:38,450
It's just, why are you doing this?

00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,500
- It seemed like the natural progression.

00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,260
I figured we'd bared our souls.

00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,410
What's a breast or two?

00:36:50,753 --> 00:36:51,720
Are you scared?

00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,553
- No.

00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,810
You're just moving a little fast for me.

00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,363
You see, I've never...

00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:06,420
I mean, I'm a...

00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,253
- Virgin.

00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,823

- A private detective.
Can you believe that?

00:38:02,473 --> 00:38:04,500
He's trying to frame me as a drug addict

00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,850
because I use tranquilizers,

00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,010
which are prescribed for
the stress he puts me under.

00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,450
Well, you should've seen
the look on his face

00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:14,130
when my new lawyer slapped
that continuance on him, boy!

00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,320
What happened with the judge?

00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,233
- Nothing.

00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,350
- [Debbie] Did he ask if you had a choice,

00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,250
which parent you'd choose?

00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,570
- Yes.

00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,743
- And what'd you say?

00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,340
- I said I didn't know.

00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,410
- Thanks a lot.

00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,763
After I let you stay with track?

00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,320
- Mom, you only agreed
because dad wanted me to quit.

00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,263
- Nevermind.

00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,370
What did Buddy say?

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,123
That ungrateful little bastard.

00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:57,163
- All right.

00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,240
So we're gonna have to
wait a little while.

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,960
She's just trying to
slow down the process,

00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,460
but she knows it's inevitable.

00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,680
- Don't worry. Be strong.

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,520
You're gonna be home soon.

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,980
- You didn't make it any
easier, did you, Jeremy?

00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,202
When the judge asked him,
he said, "I don't know."

00:39:12,202 --> 00:39:13,035
I mean, come on, duh.

00:39:13,035 --> 00:39:14,684
- It's all right. It's all right.

00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:15,590
It's all right, he still wants to believe

00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,560
that she's done no wrong.

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,173
But Jeremy, son, she has.

00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,093
Look, she moved out.

00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:21,960
She put a border between us

00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,100
and now she's trying to
blackmail me using your future.

00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,270
- Dad, I don't know.

00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,270
Look, what if you gave her more money?

00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,710
- Well, yo, yo, yo.

00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,700
Did she have you ask me that?

00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,220
- No.
- He doesn't get it, dad,

00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,020
You're such a dolt.
- Shut up! Shut up!

00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,910
The last thing I need is for you two

00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,740
to be going at each other.

00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,573
Please.

00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,330
Okay. All right.

00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:45,330
Look, I gotta go to Chicago
next week for some business.

00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,700
I got a bunch of comp tickets

00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,520
for the big King Flavor
concert at the Arts Arena.

00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,110
You wanna take some of your old pals?

00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,060
- Yeah.

00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,410
Maybe some new ones.

00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,260
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,760
- Great. Some clueless hosers.

00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,470
- Come on, Buddy. He's just
trying to get a rise out of you.

00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,963
He will get you the tickets.

00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,860
In the meantime, just be strong

00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,410
and hang in there, all right?

00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,690
And enjoy yourself at the show, huh?

00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,960
Be strong.

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,310
- Okay.

00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,620
Thanks, dad.

00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,453
- All right.

00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:20,830
- I'll see you, Buddy.

00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,010
- I'll meet you at 8:30. Don't be late.

00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,643
- Okay. 8:30.

00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,243
- Don't say a word.

00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:39,555
(crowd cheering)
(upbeat music)

00:40:53,246 --> 00:40:54,079
- [Beth] I don't know.

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,080
Maybe Detroit is in a different
time zone than Windsor.

00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,040
- [Jeremy] Sorry. He'll
be here, I promise.

00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,998
- It's just the opening
act, don't sweat it.

00:40:59,998 --> 00:41:02,230
- Unless of course we miss
all of King Flavor too.

00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,230
- Why are you so peppy
today? What's with you?

00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,161
- Well, I'm overcompensating.

00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:09,961
Whenever I'm in the US, I
feel insecure and intimidated.

00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,013
- No, no, no. Just don't worry.

00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:20,030
I'm Ben Walling's son.

00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,810
- Jeremy, hi.

00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,920
- Ellie. Ellie, hi.

00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,870
- How's Canada?

00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,860
- Great. Great, how are you?

00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,693
- Good.

00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,700
- Who is that, Ms. Team breast implants?

00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,690
- Stop it!

00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,210
She was the editor of my school newspaper.

00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,160
We worked together.

00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:39,134
- Good job, man.

00:41:39,134 --> 00:41:40,403
You're doing a great job there.

00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:44,709
- Oh yeah!
- Whoo!

00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:45,792
- Wait, wait.

00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:48,036
- What?

00:41:49,994 --> 00:41:51,600
- We've been waiting
for you. Where you been?

00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,490
- Nevermind. Who is this?

00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,723
- This is Beth.

00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,253
This is my friend Kellog. I run with him.

00:41:58,253 --> 00:42:00,950
This is my brother, Buddy
and Rocco and Hayes.

00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,066
- Hey. Hey.

00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:03,600
- Hang on a second.

00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,603
Why don't I see if I got backstage passes.

00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:07,436
- Okay.

00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,120
- So you're a big King Flavor fan?

00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,667
- Actually, no, I hate their happy lyrics.

00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,610
- So, what are you doing here?

00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:21,960
- Music turns me on.

00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,770
- You want a real turn on?

00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,980
Vodka and grapefruit juice.

00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,223
Gives you a little bit of nourishment

00:42:27,223 --> 00:42:28,423
while getting hammered.

00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:31,571
- Don't tease these guys
'cause they're jerks.

00:42:31,571 --> 00:42:33,800
It'll be nothing but trouble.

00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,453
- Don't tell me what to do
because we're not married.

00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,403
- Jeremy.

00:42:42,461 --> 00:42:43,830
- I'm gonna go over and say hello,

00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,890
'cause I haven't seen her since forever.

00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,470
- I think you mean, you
haven't seen them in forever.

00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,370
- What's with you?

00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,150
God!

00:42:52,647 --> 00:42:54,810
- Hey, how's it going?

00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,070
- What do you think of
braving the washrooms with me?

00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,343
- Let's get inside first.

00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,680
- Tell that to my bladder.

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,213
- Well, how do you piss with tights on?

00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,900
- Freely. They're crotchless.

00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,353
- Oh, their music is so great. Awesome.

00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:11,743
- You're funny,

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,633
- I'm thirsty.

00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:16,394
- Uh-oh.

00:43:19,093 --> 00:43:21,002
- It's my brother.
- Your brother? (laughs)

00:43:21,002 --> 00:43:22,460
- All access.

00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,760
Yeah, my dad prints the
programs for the show.

00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,060
There you go.

00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:28,893
Jeremy!

00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,693
- Yeah, I think I'm
gonna hit the head first.

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,170
- Yeah, why don't you beat the crowd?

00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,744
Use the executive ones downstairs.

00:43:37,744 --> 00:43:39,250
They're so dope.

00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,083
- Cool.

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,340
Later, Jeremy.
- Where are you guys sitting?

00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,910
- I think we're at fifth row or something.

00:43:52,055 --> 00:43:55,340
(Beth laughs)

00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,810
- So, very important people.

00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,350
The VIP pass. (laughs)

00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,883
Okay. Little girl's room here.

00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,573
Thank you very much.

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,583
So I'll meet you back.
You don't have to wait.

00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:15,590
- What if I want to?

00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:19,673
- Well then, I would consider
you a gentleman. (laughs)

00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,600
- You're Alison.

00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,050
That's right, I remember
from your great tense.

00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,796
- That's my friend.

00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:35,463
(Beth humming)

00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:41,720
- You guys are morons.

00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,383
She's waiting for us.

00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,413
Eat shit, Hayes.

00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:57,568
(Beth humming)

00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:07,704
- Hello?

00:45:09,742 --> 00:45:10,575
Hello?

00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,823
What's going on?

00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:17,603
Hello!

00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,223
Someone there?

00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:23,986
Hello!

00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:26,155
Hello!

00:45:29,066 --> 00:45:31,352
(laughs)

00:45:31,352 --> 00:45:32,185
Thanks.

00:45:35,726 --> 00:45:36,559
Hey, hey.

00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,163
What are you doing?

00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,100
- You lied.

00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,059
These aren't crotchless.

00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:54,960
- No, but you're gonna be
if you don't give 'em back.

00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,660
- You have to dance with me first.

00:45:58,199 --> 00:45:59,032
- Why?

00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,187
- Because I like you.

00:46:03,235 --> 00:46:04,253
The whole look.

00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,433
The way you move.

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,540
You're like a wild animal.

00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:13,343
Like me.

00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,210
- Principal Smith is such a beast.

00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,360
I mean, you should like smell it-

00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,730
- Listen, Ellie.

00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:20,687
I gotta get back to my friends

00:46:20,687 --> 00:46:21,830
but it was great seeing you.

00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,360
Really was.
- Come on, man.

00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,563
King Flavor is going right on.
- Have you seen Beth?

00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:28,531
- You really think that I'm pretty?

00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,937
- Yeah.

00:46:31,937 --> 00:46:34,437
(Beth laughs)

00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:42,557
- I'm not missing this.

00:46:42,557 --> 00:46:43,650
- What about your brother?

00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,380
- Nah. Nah, he's too wuss.

00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,213
She's bored with him.

00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:49,140
- Listen man, Rocco's really wasted.

00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:49,973
You know how he gets.

00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:50,810
Let's go see the show.

00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,110
- No!

00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:52,943
No!

00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,693
I'm going in.

00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,152
(Beth humming)

00:47:07,718 --> 00:47:10,762
- [Beth] You dance real nice.

00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:12,262
- Thanks. You too.

00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:25,191
Are you as hot as I am?

00:47:26,747 --> 00:47:27,580
- Yeah.

00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:37,326
- What do you think, Bud?

00:47:40,516 --> 00:47:41,963
- [Beth] You guys.

00:47:41,963 --> 00:47:42,906
Wait.

00:47:42,906 --> 00:47:44,099
You guys.

00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:45,484
Stop it, you guys!

00:47:45,484 --> 00:47:46,317
Stop it!

00:47:56,754 --> 00:47:58,364
- Hey, where's the bathroom?

00:47:58,364 --> 00:47:59,444
Beth!

00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:00,277
Beth!

00:48:02,014 --> 00:48:04,108
- [Beth] Stop it, you guys! Stop it!

00:48:04,108 --> 00:48:07,682
- Guys, Jeremy's coming. Let's go.

00:48:07,682 --> 00:48:08,515
- Hey.

00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:16,112
(Buddy howling)

00:48:16,112 --> 00:48:16,945
- Yeah!

00:48:20,521 --> 00:48:22,521
Get in the car. Come on.

00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:29,070
- Beth, I have to know.

00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:34,293
- Well, they didn't rape me, all right?

00:48:36,398 --> 00:48:38,248
They couldn't even do that correctly.

00:48:40,037 --> 00:48:41,187
- Oh, what did they do?

00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:52,099
- Rocco, he wouldn't let go of me,

00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:55,253
and he just kept feeling me up.

00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,250
And then Buddy...

00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,083
- Buddy?

00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,660
What did Buddy do? Did he touch you?

00:49:09,025 --> 00:49:10,717
- No.

00:49:10,717 --> 00:49:13,680
No.

00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,680
No, when I was down, he got over me

00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,960
and he masturbated on me. (sobs)

00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:27,947
And he came all over...

00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,090
- They can't get away with this.

00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:35,190
We gotta tell someone.

00:49:38,631 --> 00:49:39,798
- Who, Jeremy?

00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,483
My mother?

00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,523
You wanna rip my life apart?

00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,290
Or do you mean the police?

00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,154
'cause it's your family
that has messed up.

00:49:53,154 --> 00:49:55,354
You think your father's
gonna want you then?

00:50:00,154 --> 00:50:03,483
It was my fault.

00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:06,343
I was mad at you.

00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,820
I have a thing for barbarians.

00:50:13,756 --> 00:50:16,089
(Beth sobs)

00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:30,753
I hate being in the States.

00:50:36,946 --> 00:50:39,718
(bell rings)

00:50:39,718 --> 00:50:41,860
- I don't understand what the
hell was going on out there.

00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,240
It was like you were running through dung.

00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,273
Keep your legs up. Set your head.

00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,560
It's like you haven't
learned a damn thing.

00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,730
- I just wasn't concentrating, all right?

00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,320
- It's mental toughness.

00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,430
You don't get to just run
when you're feeling perky.

00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,960
You have to hit the job today, every day.

00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,070
You have to run through the pain.

00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,343
- Sometimes, I can't.

00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,720
- Well, maybe you should
just pack it in now.

00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,923
Save me the tears.

00:51:07,343 --> 00:51:09,600
(somber music)

00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,540
- Don't worry, man.

00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,340
It's gonna be okay.

00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,463
Hey man, don't cut me off.

00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,570
Everybody's got troubles.

00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,433
- Jeremy.

00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:35,423
How's Beth?

00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:38,555
- I don't know.

00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,863
She never showed up to school today.

00:51:44,006 --> 00:51:44,839
- Oh, man.

00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,786
Rocco really messed her up...

00:51:47,786 --> 00:51:49,168
(Jeremy grunts)

00:51:49,168 --> 00:51:51,840
Get off of me.

00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,673
I'm sorry.

00:51:56,384 --> 00:51:57,340
Listen to me. Listen to me.

00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,635
Do you understand, if she reports,

00:51:58,635 --> 00:52:01,131
do you understand what they'll do to me?

00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:02,464
Do you understand?

00:52:02,464 --> 00:52:03,822
Do you understand?

00:52:03,822 --> 00:52:05,934
- [Cap] What the hell is going on here?

00:52:05,934 --> 00:52:08,267
- What you did...
- Stop it!

00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,713
Who is this guy?

00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,960
- Jeremy's brother.

00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,703
Just fooling around, coach.

00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,480
- Superstar from south of the border.

00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,790
I heard about you at the Can-Am meeting.

00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,813
What's your best time in the 400?

00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,143
- Best?
- Yeah.

00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,233
- 49.7 at the Detroit Herald games.

00:52:33,281 --> 00:52:34,540
- 49.7.

00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:37,760
You couldn't even break a minute today.

00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,860
We'll see you at the Can-Am meeting.

00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,860
Now, you get out of here.

00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:42,693
Go.

00:52:48,464 --> 00:52:51,047

- Thanks.

00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,861
Hey.

00:55:00,861 --> 00:55:02,111
Hey, come here.

00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,193
Yeah.

00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,140
Does your mother know that
we're having dinner together?

00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:18,973
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:55:18,973 --> 00:55:20,704
I left a note. It's no big deal.

00:55:20,704 --> 00:55:21,537
- Good.

00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,820
- So is there something wrong or...

00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,830
- No.

00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:26,663
No.

00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:30,420
I just wanted to see you.

00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,383
Hey, how are things going at school?

00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,720
- It's hard actually.

00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,650
Canadians give more homework.

00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,233
- I'll bet they do, ey? (laughs)

00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,700
- Let's see, every time
I'm here, I eat the ribs.

00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,913
I go home, I feel sick from the ribs.

00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,513
I hear you had some
problems at the concert.

00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:57,403
Buddy said that Rocco
was being a real jerk.

00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:00,429
- Yeah, dad. It was real bad.

00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:03,370
- Oh, that's a shame.

00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:04,680
Buddy should learn to choose his friends

00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,180
a little better, huh?
- What?

00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,880
- So, you know what you want?

00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,430
- But dad, don't you even
wanna know what happened?

00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,230
- Yeah. Could you give us a second?

00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,063
Thanks.

00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,110
Buddy did nothing.

00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,590
He swears to me that he
never even touched her.

00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:24,930
- Dad, he jerked off on her.

00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:26,199
- Yo, yo, yo, sh!

00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:27,032
Come on.

00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,793
Jeremy.

00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,673
My God.

00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,450
I'm doing everything I can
to keep this family together.

00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:41,100
What the hell is happening to us?

00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:49,450
Look, I'm not saying for sure.

00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,340
I mean, I don't know,

00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,210
but maybe from what I
hear about this girl,

00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,990
maybe what happened, what took place there

00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:58,040
was a little more mutual
than what you think.

00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,363
- No, no, no, dad. That's ridiculous.

00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:03,543
- I don't know. Do you?

00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,000
- Yeah.

00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,833
- Just maybe.

00:57:12,383 --> 00:57:13,216
- No.

00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:17,870
- I'll tell you what, I had my
attorney speak to the judge.

00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:19,450
I want to try to get you for spring break.

00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,543
The judge said he had no problem with it.

00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,430
Why don't you and me go to Bermuda?

00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,660
We should spend some time together.

00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,050
- What? Bermuda?

00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,070
- Yeah, just you and me.

00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:34,850
Come on, you remember Danger
Cay, swimming with the fish?

00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,700
- Yeah, of course I remember, but...

00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,860
- It'll be great.

00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:41,763
Just you and me, we get away
from all of this bullshit.

00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:44,650
Let things work themselves out, huh?

00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,873
Speak of swimming with the fish.

00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,979
Well, what are you gonna have?

00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:01,030
- I don't even know-
- Have the ribs. Ribs.

00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:01,941
We'll all have the ribs.

00:58:01,941 --> 00:58:02,774
- Ribs, okay.

00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:04,410
- Ribs. It's a rib place.

00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:05,243
Have ribs.

00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:13,850
Speaking of ribs, did you see
that rack of ribs? (laughs)

00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,310
I'm sorry. I'm me.

00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:18,410
What are you gonna do?

00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,397
If you can't beat 'em, swim with 'em.

00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:29,270
Hey, whatever happens,
this will all blow over.

00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,760
Everything will work out.

00:58:33,569 --> 00:58:34,569
- I hope so.

00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,353
- I know so.

00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,680
- Great choice, Jer.

00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,210
You know what? Go to Bermuda.

00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:46,120
Go to Bermuda, and you know what?

00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,960
While you're there, why
don't you get a tan.

00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,793
Get one for your mother.
- I hope you and your dad

00:58:48,793 --> 00:58:50,610
have a great time in Bermuda.

00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,986
It's gonna be a barrel of fun.

00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:55,461
(indistinct chattering)

00:58:55,461 --> 00:58:57,621
- Take me to Bermuda.

00:58:57,621 --> 00:59:00,954
(indistinct chattering)

00:59:02,568 --> 00:59:03,401
- Quiet!

00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,410
Let him speak.

00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,170
- She's not hurt.

00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,900
She didn't freak out when I
explained it to her, not at all.

00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,500
She said that she understood
and that I should go.

00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,490
- Because she has bigger fish to fry.

00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:19,270
She wants half his
business. It's negotiation.

00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:21,320
- Why can't he just give her more money?

00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,913
- Because you see, Jeremy's
not really worth it.

00:59:23,913 --> 00:59:26,100
- Look Beth, just because
your dad does not even try

00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:26,933
to see you anymore, does not mean

00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:28,300
you have to rag out on mine.

00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,840
- Oh please, Jeremy, face it.

00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,620
Daddy loves Buddy more.

00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:33,810
- Hey, man.

00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:36,723
Firstborn always gets
the biggest fatty, man.

00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,630
- All right. All right.

00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,380
Then why does he wanna
go away with just me?

00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,250
Just me and him.

00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,780
- To antagonize your mother.

00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,500
- He knows it's her birthday, genius.

00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,220
You just better hope she
doesn't put her head in an oven

00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,278
and turn on the gas.

00:59:50,278 --> 00:59:52,945
(Guylain cries)

00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:01,096
- Look, I am going to Bermuda.

01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:08,960
I'm going to Bermuda.

01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,740
- Look, I did not make the schedule,

01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:14,020
and I would like the
throttle the joker who did.

01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,480
Opening up against the Can-Am meet

01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,490
is like going against
Goliath with a paper rock,

01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:19,050
'cause that's all we are.

01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,583
A team on paper, green and untested.

01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:26,120
So I've decided to use a
little Canadian ingenuity.

01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,060
I've created a practice meet.

01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,030
We're gonna compete

01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:31,213
against Eaton Ridge Academy in Leamington.

01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,530
You know that town with a
statue of the giant tomato?

01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:35,880
Well, we're gonna stomp it.

01:00:36,764 --> 01:00:40,170
Unfortunately, the only
day we could decide upon

01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,960
was the last Saturday
of your spring break.

01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,750
I'm sorry. I know that's short notice.

01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,040
But if we're gonna have any chance

01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,363
against those superstars
across the border,

01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,810
we're gonna need 100% attendance.

01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:57,360
Was anyone planning on
going away for the holidays?

01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:02,960
- It figures. The Yank.

01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,060
You're going somewhere with daddy?

01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,823
Palm Springs, Palm Beach?

01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:09,403
- Bermuda, actually.

01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,413
- Bermuda?

01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:15,323
- Yeah.

01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,473
Maybe I won't.

01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:21,880
- Excuse me. I didn't hear you.

01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,300
- I said maybe I won't go.

01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,143
- Personal sacrifice.

01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,552
All right.

01:01:31,552 --> 01:01:34,140
(all applauding)

01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,390
Son, you may be more
Canadian than you think.

01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,403
- Dad, no, no. It was my decision.

01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,840
Mom had nothing to do with this.

01:01:44,153 --> 01:01:45,420
Dad, I had no choice.

01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:46,253
The whole team's going.

01:01:46,253 --> 01:01:47,723
I mean, I had to.

01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:51,140
Well, I don't know.

01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,100
Can you just take Buddy or something?

01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,010
- Buddy can't go.

01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,590
He's gonna take his SATs again.

01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:56,944
I hope a lot better this time,

01:01:56,944 --> 01:01:59,953
or he's gonna end up in some
stinking junior college.

01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,040
Oh, come on...

01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,330
Jeremy, you gotta go with me.

01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,083
If you don't, who am I gonna take?

01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:13,627
I can't believe you're not gonna go.

01:02:13,627 --> 01:02:15,627
Oh, it's fine. I'll just have to cancel.

01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,950
- Dad, I'm sorry.

01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,537
I'll call you back, okay?

01:02:19,537 --> 01:02:20,537
- [Ben] Bye.

01:02:23,892 --> 01:02:25,477
- He was really upset.

01:02:25,477 --> 01:02:26,310
- Oh.

01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:28,060
- Look, stop grinning.

01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,860
What, do you get pleasure out of this?

01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,000
- Hey, give me a break.

01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,980
I am not even borderline normal.

01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:35,055
- Well, you know what?
You said it, I didn't.

01:02:35,055 --> 01:02:35,888
You know something, Beth?

01:02:35,888 --> 01:02:37,010
You're not happy unless
everyone around you

01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,573
is as screwed up as you are.

01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:40,503
- What?

01:02:40,503 --> 01:02:41,336
- Yeah, and another thing.

01:02:41,336 --> 01:02:42,740
I figured out why no one likes you.

01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:43,677
Because the minute someone does,

01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:45,293
you just stomp all over them.

01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:47,780
People have feelings too.

01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:49,940
- Yeah, people also have assholes

01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,390
and that's how you're acting.

01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:54,450
- You know what?

01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:55,743
Forget it. It's over.

01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:58,319
I don't wanna see you anymore.

01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:01,247
- Jeremy.

01:03:01,247 --> 01:03:03,515
(gentle music)

01:03:03,515 --> 01:03:05,610
What do you mean you don't
wanna see me anymore?

01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:07,960
You think I'm gonna be invisible?

01:03:11,414 --> 01:03:12,947

- Thank you for such a great birthday.

01:03:54,726 --> 01:03:56,463
It was so special to me.

01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:02,220
Jeremy, you're so grown
up. You're almost a man.

01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:03,920
Tell me about this girl.

01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,280
- I should get to bed.
- Do you like her?

01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,840
Well, I hope she's on the pill, Jeremy.

01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:08,680
- Mom, please, please.

01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:11,233
- Oh, don't be such a party pooper.

01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,185
Jeremy, give me a nightcap.

01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,070
- Mom, I don't think you need it.

01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,119
- Jeremy, it's my birthday.

01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:20,369
Get me a drink.

01:04:23,077 --> 01:04:24,570
Did I tell you how I used to be an actress

01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,130
at Michigan State?

01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:26,963
- Yes.

01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:33,693
- Well, there's a lot of
things you don't know, Jeremy.

01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,573
Good things.

01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,013
That's what I want.

01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,543
Good things.

01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,313
Yeah.

01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:45,510
What do you want?

01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:46,940
- Right now, sleep.

01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:47,800
I've gotta be at my best.

01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,523
We go to Leamington in the morning.

01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,090
- Well, you go to bed then.

01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:55,090
'cause I'm coming to watch you tomorrow.

01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,440
Come here and give your
mother a good night hug.

01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:04,350
Come on, Jeremy.

01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:05,760
Come here.

01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,593
Come on.

01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,483
(gentle music)

01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,150
Oh, thank you.

01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:16,583
Thank you so much for
a wonderful birthday.

01:06:04,443 --> 01:06:07,110
(phone ringing)

01:06:30,109 --> 01:06:30,942
- Mom?

01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:50,573
Hello.

01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:52,910
- [Beth] Jeremy, you're a bastard.

01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:53,950
- What?

01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:56,090
- You sat across from
me for two hours tonight

01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:57,160
without saying a word,

01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,230
and you made me feel like
a total piece of shit.

01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:01,573
And you talk about feelings?

01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,210
Are you gonna talk to me or not?

01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:06,403
Don't you care at all?

01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:08,890
- Wait, wait, wait, Beth.

01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:10,573
What time is it?

01:07:10,573 --> 01:07:12,173
- [Beth] It's not even midnight.

01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:14,263
Jeremy.

01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:17,723
Jeremy.

01:07:20,321 --> 01:07:21,723
- Just hold on a sec, okay?

01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,823
- [Beth] Answer me, Jeremy.

01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:27,010
- Mom?

01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,440
- [Beth] Jeremy, don't do this to me.

01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,060
Jeremy, talk to me.

01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,280
- Mom?

01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,150
- [Beth] Are you gonna talk to me? Jeremy.

01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,490
- Mom, are you in there?

01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:36,990
- [Beth] Jeremy, get on the phone.

01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:37,823
Okay, fine.

01:07:39,168 --> 01:07:40,760
- Mom?
- Fine, I'm hanging up.

01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,410
I'm hanging up.

01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:43,603
Goodbye. Goodbye.

01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,433
(dial tone beeps)

01:07:48,376 --> 01:07:51,126
(dramatic music)

01:08:16,001 --> 01:08:17,562
- Come on!

01:08:17,562 --> 01:08:18,642
Come on!

01:08:18,642 --> 01:08:19,475
Come on!

01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:22,068
Mom!

01:08:22,068 --> 01:08:22,901
Mom!

01:08:29,952 --> 01:08:32,619
(siren wailing)

01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,053
- Jeremy.

01:08:45,377 --> 01:08:47,015
- Hey.

01:08:47,015 --> 01:08:49,700
- Hey.

01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,453
- If you hadn't called, she'd be dead.

01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,543
- Score one for the CoDs.

01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,707
Warning, my mother's right behind.

01:08:57,707 --> 01:09:00,073
She wouldn't let me come without her.

01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:07,200
- Jeremy, I'm just sick.

01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,390
Is Debbie okay?

01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:10,790
- She's in intensive care,
but she's stabilized.

01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:13,545
- Was it intentional?

01:09:13,545 --> 01:09:14,660
- What?

01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,990
- Honey, did she leave a note?

01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:20,210
- Mom, maybe Jeremy doesn't
wanna get into this right now.

01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:21,260
- It was an accident.

01:09:22,184 --> 01:09:24,753
It was a combination of the
tranquilizers and the wine.

01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:29,023
She must've slipped getting in the tub.

01:09:29,987 --> 01:09:32,117
- I'd think up a good
story about what happened

01:09:32,117 --> 01:09:34,460
before your father finds out.

01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:35,600
- Okay. That's enough.

01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,130
If you wanna stay, fine.

01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:38,930
Go chat up a widow doctor or something,

01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:41,003
but leave Jeremy alone, okay?

01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:49,523
How you doin'?

01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:52,387
- I'm okay.

01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,558
I keep thinking, if I'd gone to Bermuda,

01:09:57,558 --> 01:10:00,042
would this have happened?

01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:01,520
- Come on.

01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,033
You didn't just stay for her.

01:10:06,191 --> 01:10:07,560
You had the track meet as well.

01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,997
- Oh God, the track meet.
I forgot all about it.

01:10:15,863 --> 01:10:18,277
Look, there's our doctor.

01:10:18,277 --> 01:10:19,350
They're gonna let me see her.

01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:21,330
So, I'm gonna go.

01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:22,353
- Okay. Yeah.

01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:27,396
So, I can stay if you want.

01:10:27,396 --> 01:10:29,063
- You don't have to.

01:10:46,837 --> 01:10:48,420
- I feel so stupid.

01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,047
- It's all right.

01:10:53,047 --> 01:10:54,412
(Debbie sobs)

01:10:54,412 --> 01:10:56,032
It's all right.

01:10:56,032 --> 01:10:58,615
(gentle music)

01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:14,383
(ominous music)
Hello.

01:11:21,266 --> 01:11:22,099
Hello.

01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,490
- Boo!
- Hey.

01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:29,030
- Hi. I was hoping you'd get home soon.

01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:30,870
Dinner is getting cold.

01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,060
- How'd you get in here?

01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:34,120
- The building manager
was pretty freaked out

01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,965
about everything, so he let me into clean.

01:11:36,965 --> 01:11:37,883
- There was a lot of blood.

01:11:37,883 --> 01:11:39,370
I mean, you didn't have to.

01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:42,160
- Hey, I figure, if the
Trojan women could handle it,

01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,800
so could I.

01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,990
Besides, I figure at a certain level,

01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:45,990
it's all sense memory.

01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:47,490
You know, something I can use.

01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:49,213
- For what?

01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:51,270
- I want to be a writer.

01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:54,320
Big historical novels, sex, blood,

01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,890
high cholesterol food
cooked under the saddle

01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:56,993
of rampaging hordes.

01:11:58,290 --> 01:11:59,930
- Sounds awesome.

01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:02,210
- So far, I just keep a
daily diary but you know,

01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:03,610
at least I talk a good game.

01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:09,160
So listen, go downstairs and start,

01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:12,863
and I will just wash up
and be down in two seconds.

01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:34,350
Oh, your dad called and your
coach, messages on the machine.

01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:35,943
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:12:36,821 --> 01:12:38,190
I'm trying to get in touch with coach.

01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:39,023
- Yeah.

01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,780
- Does your mom know you're here?

01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,350
- I left her a note.

01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:48,840
I'll deal with her later.

01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,073
I am having way too
much fun playing house.

01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,223
- Where'd you get all this stuff?

01:12:56,223 --> 01:13:00,170
- I went shopping, and
then I did your laundry.

01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:02,520
I think I'm already a better wife material

01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,753
than my mother ever was.

01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:08,460
- Would you ever get married?

01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:12,383
Knowing what you know, even
if you really love the person.

01:13:14,321 --> 01:13:17,813
- Silly boy, there's
no such thing as love.

01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:23,963
It's just different levels of feels good.

01:13:27,886 --> 01:13:30,680
But I wish that we were married right now.

01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:33,243
- Yeah.

01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:35,340
Parents would love that.

01:13:36,623 --> 01:13:38,433
We'd have to run away or something.

01:13:38,433 --> 01:13:40,810
- Hey, well, you know,
we'd only have to hide out

01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:42,600
until we're 18 and then there's nothing

01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,850
anybody can say about it.

01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:50,373
- Hey.

01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:55,063
I'm sorry.

They say that sex is the
cornerstone to a happy marriage.

01:14:44,038 --> 01:14:46,340
It's the physical action
that causes the desire

01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:47,740
for non-physical commitment.

01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:50,643

I wasn't very good, was I?

01:15:25,653 --> 01:15:27,530
- Don't worry about it.

01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:28,530
You'll get the hang.

01:15:31,695 --> 01:15:33,528
- You wanna try again?

(Beth laughs)

01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:38,963

01:15:46,396 --> 01:15:48,979
(gentle music)

01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:19,683
- Morning, everybody.

01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:25,033
Mr. Dickens, and I'll take that hug now.

01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:27,970
- Sit down, Beth.

01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:29,350
We need to get started.

01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:31,400
- Well, we can't start
yet. Jeremy's not here.

01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,030
- Jeremy's not coming.

01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:33,863
- No. Yeah, he is.

01:16:33,863 --> 01:16:35,630
He had to pick up his mom
and then he'll be here

01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:37,520
because he wouldn't miss our happy hour.

01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,280
- No, he's not.

01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,510
Quinn, was your father
released from rehab?

01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:42,910
- No, he's coming.

01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:43,743
- He's not.

01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,590
- I'm sorry, did you sleep
with him last night too?

01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:56,010
- Actually, the social
services took Jeremy.

01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:59,543
After what happened to his mother,

01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:03,123
his dad was granted temporary custody.

01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:06,473
So...

01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:12,957
Horace, do you wanna start today?

01:17:12,957 --> 01:17:16,210
(somber music)

01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:18,288
- Karen and dad are moving in together.

01:17:18,288 --> 01:17:20,871
They're getting a bigger house.

01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:33,400
- That's right. Throw your things around.

01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,953
That's very constructive.

01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:39,210
Look, I said you could
race for the Canadian team.

01:17:39,210 --> 01:17:40,600
What more do you want from me?

01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,200
- Dad, I don't wanna be here.

01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,440
- Jeremy, you're upset.

01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,960
I'm sorry, I should've gotten you myself.

01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,380
I didn't realize they're gonna yank you

01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,880
right out of school like that.

01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:52,550
I thought this is what you wanted.

01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:53,850
- No, it's not what I want, dad.

01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:54,843
I wanna be back at my school.

01:17:54,843 --> 01:17:56,793
I wanna be with my girlfriend.

01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,633
- Girlfriend?

01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:03,363
Jeremy, look what women do to us.

01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:07,890
Haven't you learned
anything? Don't be stupid.

01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:12,693
I'm sorry.

01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,830
I wish there was something more I could do

01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:16,923
to prove that to you.

01:18:20,006 --> 01:18:21,300
Just don't give up on me, huh?

01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,883
(gentle music)

01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:28,913
I'm sorry.

01:18:38,195 --> 01:18:40,862
(phone ringing)

01:18:46,392 --> 01:18:47,350
- [Beth] Jeremy.

01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:48,300
- Hey, how did you know it was me?

01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,930
- Had no friends, remember?

01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:53,373
- Come on. I miss you, don't spoil it.

01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,773
- How's it going?

01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:00,260
- Better than I thought.

01:19:01,384 --> 01:19:03,800
I had a good conversation with my dad.

01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,200
And I'm still running
for Laurier tomorrow.

01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,033
Are you coming?

01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:09,710
- Yeah, I'll be there.

01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:10,543
- Great.

01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:15,650
- Jeremy.

01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:16,483
- Yeah.

01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,110
- Nevermind.

01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:22,663
- What is it? Are you
mad at me or something?

01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:26,863
- Yeah.

01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:31,730
Yeah, I'm just mad that we're not sleeping

01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:32,753
in your mom's bed.

01:19:38,336 --> 01:19:39,419
- I love you.

01:19:44,349 --> 01:19:45,880
(Beth sniffles)

01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,713
Bye.

01:20:08,126 --> 01:20:10,709
(cars honking)

01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,420
- [Announcer] Athletes
and coaches must report in

01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,890
to the scorekeepers bench on arrival.

01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:25,990
Please have your registration forms ready.

01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:29,204
- What's the matter, dad?

01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:31,904
- Well, Buddy got his
SAT scores yesterday.

01:20:31,904 --> 01:20:34,680
He needed a combined 1000 to
qualify for Michigan South.

01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,810
He totally tanks it with a 970,

01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:39,898
comes up 30 points short.

01:20:39,898 --> 01:20:40,810
- Well, it's no big deal.

01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:41,730
He can take it again.

01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:42,580
- No, it is a big deal.

01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:44,440
He can't take it again.

01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,190
The only chance he has is South Kansas.

01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:47,340
The coach from South, he said,

01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:48,640
if Buddy can win a couple of events,

01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,920
he can probably get him in,
but now Rocco's got the flu,

01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,830
and Buddy feels like
he's coming down with it.

01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:55,770
- Dad, I run and I have asthma.

01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:58,620
- I know, I know, but
this is Buddy's big shot.

01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:03,303
Look, see what you can do
to help him out, all right?

01:21:03,303 --> 01:21:05,100
Be a good brother.

01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,620
- Have you seen my
black and white sweater.

01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:07,453
- Why?

01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:10,440
- Because I wanna wear it.

01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,540
- Where are you going?

01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:16,200
- There's a track meet
at the sports complex.

01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:22,100
- Oh, so you wanna get assaulted again?

01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:22,933
- What?

01:21:22,933 --> 01:21:25,090
- That's where those boys
are gonna be today, isn't it?

01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:26,300
I know all about it.

01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:28,400
You shouldn't have left
your diary out in the open.

01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:32,190
Those boys are gonna pay
for everything they did.

01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:34,107
- Well, I am not going to the police.

01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:38,913
Oh my God!

01:21:39,934 --> 01:21:41,267
You already did.

01:21:44,513 --> 01:21:45,623
God, damn you!

01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:49,700
- You're not going anywhere.

01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:51,166
Look, I'm your mother, sweetie.

01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:52,626
You're not gonna go anywhere.
- You're not anymore.

01:21:52,626 --> 01:21:53,755
Just let go of me.

01:21:53,755 --> 01:21:56,922
(indistinct shouting)

01:21:59,093 --> 01:22:00,600

Do it, baby. Leap.

01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,647
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:22:16,570 --> 01:22:18,353
That was good. That was good.

01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,460
Come on, call it. Call it.

01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,073
- Length of jump, 6.84 meters.
- 6.8? 6.8!

01:22:26,889 --> 01:22:27,722
(crowd applauding)

01:22:27,722 --> 01:22:29,541
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:22:29,541 --> 01:22:31,829
- Relax, he's doing great.
- What'd you write? Good?

01:22:31,829 --> 01:22:33,579
Good, that was great.

01:22:35,273 --> 01:22:38,040
- [Announcer] 6.84 meters,
that's the winning number.

01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,773

01:22:41,312 --> 01:22:44,220

will be at a height of 1.9 meters.

01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:55,040
And for our American friends,

01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:59,283
that translates to six
feet and three inches.

01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:01,360
- This is Kellog.

01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,970

competitor, Kellog Clifford.

01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:05,833

01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:33,708
Come on, Buddy.

01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,087
All right, come on, Buddy.

01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,200
- [Announcer] Oh, looks like
Walling fails to move on.

01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,491
- You'll get the next one, bud.

01:23:50,491 --> 01:23:52,859
- I just got eliminated, doofus.

01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:54,317
- He's mad at himself.

01:23:54,317 --> 01:23:55,773
He knows he's not his best.

01:23:56,974 --> 01:24:01,403
He's got a cold or flu
or something coming on.

01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,780
He'll just have to take the 400.

01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,167
- Hey look, if he does need us

01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:08,400
and he can always start
at junior college, Ben.

01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,250
There's no shame.

01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:11,200
- Sal, have you ever
seen a faster, big guy?

01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,861
This guy's a champion.

01:24:12,861 --> 01:24:15,080
He's the best. He's like a race horse.

01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:15,913
You watch.

01:24:18,990 --> 01:24:22,060
- I gotta tell you, I like
the way your younger boy runs.

01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:23,463
- Jeremy.

01:24:23,463 --> 01:24:24,900
- [Announcer] Spectators

01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:28,406

- What? What did you say?

01:24:29,653 --> 01:24:30,790
- Your younger son.

01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:32,743
Cap Pierce tells me he's a real comer.

01:24:32,743 --> 01:24:33,743
- Just come.

01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:38,320
- He's gettin' there.

01:24:47,155 --> 01:24:47,988
- Beth.

01:24:49,556 --> 01:24:50,400
Hey.

01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,320
Hey, I'm up next.

01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,153
- I'm leaving.

01:24:53,418 --> 01:24:54,580
- What?

01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:56,390
Wait, you gotta watch me run.

01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:57,550
I qualified for the finals.

01:24:57,550 --> 01:24:59,238
I'm running against Buddy.

01:24:59,238 --> 01:25:01,338
(gentle music)
- My mother read my diary.

01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,703
She reported your brother and Rocco.

01:25:06,015 --> 01:25:06,848
- Oh my God.

01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,783
- Do you know what this
is gonna be like for me?

01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:13,090
Come with me.

01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:14,723
- The race. You gotta watch me.

01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:16,945
- I'm doomed.

01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:21,083
- Jeremy, your event's up.

01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,730
- Make a choice. It's disappearing time.

01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:28,173
- But Beth, you can't leave.

01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,080
- Don't tell me what I can't do.

01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:34,223
- Son, what's it gonna
be? Make up your mind.

01:25:38,323 --> 01:25:39,156

Finalists for the 400,

01:25:54,717 --> 01:25:56,301
- Kellog.

01:25:56,301 --> 01:25:57,720
- [Announcer] Ladies
and gentlemen, please...

01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:58,553
- My inhaler.

01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:00,514
- You don't need it.

01:26:00,514 --> 01:26:01,530
The amount of adrenaline
you're gonna have pumped

01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:04,733
through your system will see you through.

01:26:04,733 --> 01:26:06,257
What you got to worry about
is getting a good start.

01:26:06,257 --> 01:26:09,970

01:26:20,738 --> 01:26:23,321
(gentle music)

01:26:32,279 --> 01:26:33,112
Set.

01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:43,480
(gunshot blares)

01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,320
- False start. Lane four.

01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,463
- That was Jeremy, your boy there.

01:26:50,236 --> 01:26:52,697
(gentle music)

01:26:52,697 --> 01:26:54,680
- I want you to do it again, okay?

01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,710
It's screwing up Raymer.

01:26:56,710 --> 01:26:57,800
I need this race.

01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,712
Did dad tell you?
- Yeah, yeah, he told me.

01:26:59,712 --> 01:27:00,980
- All right, baby.

01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:02,090
- Stay cool, fellas. Stay cool.

01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:04,590
- Don't look like Raymer
was too happy about that.

01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:09,513
- Runners, take your marks.

01:27:15,298 --> 01:27:16,833

01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:28,730
- [Announcer] Set.

01:27:35,107 --> 01:27:38,460
(gunshot blares)

01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,340
- You got it, Buddy. You got it.

01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:40,173
Keep the pace.

01:27:41,895 --> 01:27:44,062
- Run, run, run, run, run.

01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:49,929
- It's yours, Buddy.

01:27:49,929 --> 01:27:52,363
It's all yours now, baby. Take it.

01:27:52,363 --> 01:27:54,113

01:27:56,414 --> 01:27:58,862

01:27:58,862 --> 01:28:01,418
(crowd cheering)

01:28:01,418 --> 01:28:02,251
- Yes!

01:28:04,407 --> 01:28:06,513
- Your younger son just
ran the race of his life.

01:28:06,513 --> 01:28:10,323
- Yeah, I wish he would
have done that another day.

01:28:17,603 --> 01:28:18,686
- Beth! Beth!

01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:24,010
(crowd laughing)

01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:29,933
- Jeremy, yo.

01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:32,813
- Beth, wait.

01:28:32,813 --> 01:28:33,646
- What are you doing? Stop.

01:28:33,646 --> 01:28:34,479
Would you stop?

01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:36,030
Turn around and talk to me.

01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:37,930
Don't you walk away from me.

01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:39,247
Jeremy!

01:28:39,247 --> 01:28:40,940
Get back here.
- Beth!

01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,860
- How could you do that, Jeremy?

01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:44,153
You ambushed him right from the start.

01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:45,610
- Dad, I won the race.

01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:47,200
Why can't you just be happy for me?

01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,033
- Happy for you?

01:28:48,033 --> 01:28:50,120
Do you know how embarrassing
this is for Buddy and me?

01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,060
- Embarrassing? You know what, grow up.

01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:54,403
- Don't ever push me,
you ungrateful, little...

01:28:54,403 --> 01:28:56,373
- Hey, hey, whoa, whoa!

01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:57,454
- You get out of here?

01:28:57,454 --> 01:29:01,198
Get of my face!
- Cool down, cool down.

01:29:01,198 --> 01:29:02,560
Go on.

01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,393
Enjoy your victory.

01:29:03,393 --> 01:29:05,680
- Yeah. Yeah, go on.

01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,210
Go on. That's right, go on.

01:29:07,210 --> 01:29:09,310
Yeah, join your little
girlfriend down there.

01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:11,520
And your mother while you're at it.

01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,773
The three of you deserve each other.

01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:19,810
What are you looking at?

01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:24,120
You just stay the hell
out of my family, mister.

01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:25,350
- You're a fool.

01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:27,363
- Oh yeah. Another Canadian, ey.

01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:29,793
Yeah, that's it. Walk away.

01:29:39,061 --> 01:29:39,894
Oh, Jesus.

01:29:40,857 --> 01:29:41,690
Oh...

01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:43,933
God!

01:29:46,485 --> 01:29:48,234
- What a mess.

01:29:48,234 --> 01:29:50,934
- I know, and it's not gonna
go away for either of us.

01:29:54,053 --> 01:29:55,726
Are you coming with me?

01:29:55,726 --> 01:29:57,693
- You know, you're a real pain.

01:29:59,590 --> 01:30:01,190
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:03,597
- Close enough.

01:30:10,916 --> 01:30:13,680
- You know, we're gonna get through this

01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:16,240
because for the first time in my life,

01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,600
I don't care what happens.

01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:23,433
- For the first time, I feel
happy for somebody else.

01:30:24,848 --> 01:30:26,330
- Oh, yeah?

01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:27,163
Who?

01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:29,793
- You, dummy.

01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:33,603
You think that's love.

01:30:34,545 --> 01:30:36,340
- Or a different kinda feels good.

01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:38,740
- Don't mock my pain. I'm
having a breakthrough.

01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:44,833
When I saw you win up
there, I felt like I won.

01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,940
That's gotta be real love, doesn't it?

01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:58,863
So that's a yes, right?
