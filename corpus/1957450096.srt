I’LL HAVE TO MOVE MY FRIEND’S STUFF OUT OF YOUR ROOM.

377
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,943
I DIDN’T THINK YOU WERE COMING. [CHANEL] WHERE WILL HE STAY?

378
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:37,114
HE CAN CRASH IN MY ROOM. I’M SLEEPING ON THE COUCH.

00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,886

00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,356
WHO IS ANA?

406
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,392
THAT’S JULIAN’S GIRLFRIEND.

407
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,593
I THOUGHT YOU WAS GAY?

408
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,695
SHE'S A CHILDHOOD FRIEND.

409
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,563
SO IS STEVEN YOUR BOY?

410
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,199
NO. STEVEN’S ACTUALLY STRAIGHT.

411
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,802
[LAUGHS] HE'S NOT STRAIGHT.

412
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,738

413
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:11,275
SO WHAT, YOU INTO STRAIGHT MEN NOW?

414
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:16,580
YOU CAN TELL ME. I GOT A COUSIN WHO'S GAY. IT'S COOL.

415
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,916
ENOUGH OF THE GAY TALK. I'M EATING.

416
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,219
OH, I’M SORRY. I ALMOST FORGOT, YOUR BROTHER IS HOMOPHOBIC.

417
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,289
I’M SORRY, IS THAT WHY YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOU HAD A BROTHER?

418
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,091
I'M DONE.

419
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,861
HE NEVER COULD GET PAST THAT.

420
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,930
NOW I SEE WHY HE NEVER MENTIONED YOU.

421
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,167
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU SEEM LIKE YOU GOT IT ALL TOGETHER.

422
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,904
DON’T PAY HIM NO MIND, OKAY? YOU BE WHO YOU ARE.

423
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:44,575
BUT. YOU’VE GOT TO TELL ME WHAT’S GOING ON WITH YOU AND STEVEN.

424
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:50,581
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I'M NOT SURE. I MEAN, WE JUST MET,

425
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,650
THEN THIS HAPPENED AND...

426
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,886
I DON’T KNOW, HE JUST SHOWED UP. YEAH?

427
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:59,056
MAYBE HE DOES LIKE ME. MAYBE?

428
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,425
WELL, I THINK SO, OR ELSE HE WOULDN’T BE HERE.

429
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:04,762
WHAT, ARE YOU BLIND? CAN’T SEE WHAT’S RIGHT IN YOUR EYES?

WELCOME TO CASKETS FOR LESS.

436
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,267
SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR LOSS.

00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:47,438
WE HAVE CASKETS OF EVERY COLOR.

438
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:50,574

00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,634
BY THE WAY, ON THE WAY HOME,

00:43:57,634 --> 00:44:00,037
WOULD YOU MIND DROPPING ME AT MRS. WINNIE’S HOUSE?

458
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,143
SHE’S OUR NEIGHBOR, AND SHE LOOKED AFTER MY MOM,

459
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,878
AND I’D LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

TO HELP DOING HIS MOURNING, AND LOOK, YOU DON’T HAVE TO BULLSHIT WITH ME.

477
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,920
I KNOW WHAT’S UP.

478
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:30,794
SO. WHAT'S UP WITH YOU? NOTHING.

479
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:35,799
I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM THROUGH ALL OF THIS. IT’S CALLED BEING HUMAN.

480
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,034
I REMEMBER WHEN MY MOM DIED.

00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,169
IT WAS VERY HARD ON ME,

482
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:43,974
AND BACK THEN, I WISH I HAD SOMEONE TO LEND ME MORAL SUPPORT.

483

DO YOU WANT ME TO PROVE IT TO YOU?

488
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,823
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

489
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,928
HEY, YOU WANT A BUMP?

490
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,702
NO, NO, NO. I STOPPED DOING THAT A LONG TIME AGO.

00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,569
[LAUGHS] YEAH, THAT’S IT.

499
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:24,575
[WINNIE] IT WAS SUDDEN. SHE NEVER COMPLAINED.

500
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,577
SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING.

501
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:32,149
I DON’T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

502
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:36,053
SHE ALWAYS LEFT A LIGHT ON. THAT’S HOW I KNEW THAT SHE WAS HOME.

503
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:43,060
I STOPPED BY AND KNOCKED ON THE DOOR FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.

504
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,900
I ENTERED USING THE SPARE KEY SHE GAVE ME.

505
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,537
THE TELEVISION WAS ON.

506
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,673
THE LIGHTS WERE ON.

507
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:59,543
WHEN I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN, THAT’S WHERE I FOUND HER.

508
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,849
[TV CHATTER]

509
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,318
[TV OFF]

510
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,220
HOW YOU FEELING, STEVIE BABY?

511
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,422
OH, I FEEL LIKE I SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE THIS.

512
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,358
OH, COME ON, YOU WERE JUST HAVING A LITTLE FUN.

I DON’T KNOW. MAYBE.

518
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:39,082
WHO GAVE YOU THAT NAME, ANYWAY?

519
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:44,888
IT’S MY REAL NAME. ACTUALLY, IT WAS MY MOTHER’S FAVORITE PERFUME:

00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,556
CHANEL NUMBER FIVE.

00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,096
I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

522
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:57,834
YOUR MOTHER LEFT ONE OF YOU WITH A BRIEFCASE.

523
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:00,437
YEAH, MICHAEL HAS IT.

524
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,607
IN IT, YOU’LL FIND HER LAST WISHES.

525
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:08,178
HOW CAN I EVER THANK YOU, MRS. WINNIE,

526
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,480
FOR TAKING CARE OF HER WHILE I WAS GONE?

527
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,119
YOU DON’T NEED TO. YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR A LIFETIME.

528
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,989
SHE’S UP THERE, LOOKING AT US.

529
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,991
SMILING.

530
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:24,628
I’VE KNOWN YOUR MOTHER SINCE WE WERE LITTLE GIRLS.

531
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,497
WE WENT TO THE SAME SCHOOLS TOGETHER,

532
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:31,134
AND HAVE REMAINED FRIENDS EVER SINCE.

533
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:34,037
MY HUSBAND, MAY HE REST IN PEACE,

534
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,872
AND YOUR FATHER...

535
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:41,211
WE ALL GREW UP TOGETHER, AND PRACTICALLY MARRIED AT THE SAME TIME.

536
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:46,316
WE WERE POOR, BUT WE MADE DO WITH WHAT WE HAD.

537
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:50,487
AND YOU’LL BE FINE. HANG IN THERE.

538
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,890
AND, YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER A PLANNER,

539
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:58,428
AND SHE REALLY SPENT A LOT OF TIME PLANNING FOR THIS MOMENT.

540
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,603
IT’S GETTING LATE, I GOT TO GO.

541
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,138
ONE MORE THING.

542
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:12,342
YOUR MOTHER DOES NOT WANT A WHOLE BIG TO-DO AT HER FUNERAL.

543
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,178
SHE ALWAYS MENTIONED TO ME

544
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:19,983
THAT SHE DOES NOT WANT A CONGREGATION OF STRANGERS AT HER FUNERAL.

545
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:25,122
SHE ONLY WANTS TO SPEND HER LAST MOMENTS WITH BOTH HER SONS.

546
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,994
GOOD NIGHT, MRS. WINNIE.

547
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,397
GOOD NIGHT, JULIAN. THANK YOU.

548
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,332
SHALOM.

549
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,475
YOU KNOW, YOU’S A GOOD-LOOKING HUNK.

550
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,945
YOU LIKE HOT CHOCOLATE? [CHUCKLES]

551
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:51,481
MAYBE. WHY DO YOU ASK?

552
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,618
BECAUSE I WANT TO BE YOUR COD BERRY.

553
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,656
WHAT ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND?

554
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,491
HE’S PROBABLY IN THE OTHER ROOM,

555
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:05,262
STRUNG OUT, PASSED OUT, WHO THE FUCK KNOWS.

556
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,466
BUT WE ARE HERE. HMM?

557
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:15,705
YOU ARE HERE, I’M HERE.

558
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,577
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

559
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:29,286
MM.

560
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,388
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

561
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,889
JULIAN COULD WALK IN ANY MINUTE.

562
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:36,259
[LAUGHS] SO LET’S NOT WASTE ANY MORE TIME.

563
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,716
[GRUNTS]

564
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,524
OW! [LAUGHS]

565
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,203
[CRYING OUT]

566
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:22,772
[YELLS]

567
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,844
[MICHAEL] WHAT THE FUCK?

568
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:29,145
WAIT, I CAN EXPLAIN.

569
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:32,716
DON'T SAY A FUCKING THING! YOU HAVE NOTHING TO EXPLAIN!

570
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,256
HEY.

571
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,658
WHAT WAS THAT? WHAT?

572
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,661
I HEARD A DOOR SLAM.

573
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,464
[CHANEL] EVERYTHING IS FINE. WE WERE, UM,

574
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:50,834
WE WERE JUST... WE WERE WATCHING TELEVISION. SO...

575
00:52:54,037 --> 00:53:00,043
WHY WASN’T THE TV ON? BECAUSE...

576
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:02,412
BECAUSE...

577
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:05,348
UH, BECAUSE...

578
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,717
EVERYTHING’S ALL RIGHT. RIGHT?

579
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:11,454
[CHANEL] ACTUALLY, I’M VERY TIRED. IT’S BEST I GO TO BED.

580
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,423
[LAUGHS] SO...

581
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,492
HOW DID IT GO WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR?

582
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,429
FINE.

583
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:22,666
MM. WHAT?

584
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,768
YOU’RE SITTING ON MY BED.

585
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:27,337
[CHANEL LAUGHS]

586
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:30,540
YOU KNOW, YOU’RE RIGHT.

587
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,108
I REALLY NEED TO GO TO BED.

588
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:34,544
SO, UM... LOOK, UM...

589
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,846
YEAH. SO... YEAH, GOOD NIGHT.

590
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,882
GOOD NIGHT.

591
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,250
ARE YOU GUYS ALL RIGHT?

592
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,453
OH YEAH, I MEAN, I’VE JUST HAD A LONG DAY. SO...

593
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:46,189
WHERE'S MICHAEL AT?

594
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:49,259
[CHANEL] OH, HE’S PROBABLY SLEEPING. WHY DON’T I GO CHECK ON HIM?

595
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:54,664
EXCUSE ME. SEE YOU TOMORROW. GOOD NIGHT.

596
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,547
COFFEE?

597
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:14,351
I FEEL SICK. ARE ANY OF THE GUYS UP?

598
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:17,988
NAH, THEY’RE STILL ASLEEP.

599
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:20,190
I FEEL LIKE A TRAIN WRECK.

600
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,859
PROBABLY LOOK LIKE ONE.

601
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:27,063
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS?

602
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:30,467
I DON'T KNOW. I STILL GOT TO TALK TO JULIAN.

603
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,969
SO, DID YOU GIVE HIM THE SUITCASE?

604
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,971
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT TODAY.

605
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,443
COME HERE.

606
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,853
YOU’RE CRAZY, YOU KNOW THAT?

607
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:52,188
YEAH, BUT THAT'S WHY YOU LOVE ME.

608
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:53,923
TRUE.

609
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:58,695
SO, UH, HOW STRAIGHT’S STEVEN?

610
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,465
PRETTY STRAIGHT TO ME.

611
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:07,504
SO, YOUR FIVE DAYS ARE UP.

612
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:11,474
I KNOW.

613
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,810
YOU COMPLETED ALL YOUR DUTIES.

614
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,314
IS THAT HOW YOU SEE ME?

615
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,883
AS A DUTY I NEEDED TO FULFILL?

616
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:26,222
I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO THINK. I’M TIRED OF THINKING.

617
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:27,624
NOW THAT THE AUCTION IS OVER...

618
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,226
YOU DO THINK TOO MUCH.

619
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,063
LET’S JUST ENJOY EACH OTHER’S COMPANY.

620
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,967
AND I COULD SURE USE A GOOD MASSAGE.

621
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:49,479
WELL, HOW WAS HE?

622
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,551
COME ON, WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? ARE YOU JEALOUS?

623
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,319
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

624
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,023
[CHUCKLING] WELL, I THINK YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW HE COMPARES TO YOU.

625
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,527
WELL, HOW DOES HE?

626
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,231
HE DOESN’T.

627
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:12,001
REALLY? WHY?

628
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,671
I MAY HAVE HAD SEX WITH HIM, BUT...

629
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,541
I LOVE YOU.

630
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:26,649
I DON’T APPROVE OF WHAT HE’S DOING.

631
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,520
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

632
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,723
I DON'T KNOW. IT GETS COMPLICATED.

633
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,859
SIMPLIFY IT FOR ME.

634
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:42,832
MY PARENTS ALWAYS HAD HIM ON A PEDESTAL.

635
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:46,469
AFTER I FOUND OUT ABOUT HIM, THAT’S WHEN I KEPT MY DISTANCE.

636
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,807
I WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM.

637
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:55,178
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT AFFECTED MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MOM,

638
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:57,447
BECAUSE HE LIVED WITH HER.

639
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,784
WAIT, YOU NEVER VISITED...

640
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:03,520
YOU NEVER VISITED YOUR MOTHER BECAUSE OF YOUR BROTHER?

641
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:06,923
MICHAEL!

642
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:46,696
AFTER OUR DAD DIED, THAT’S WHEN I KEPT MY DISTANCE.

643
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,136
BABY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M GOING TO BE FINE.

644
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,840
I FUCKED THINGS UP!

645
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,876
NO, NO, NO, YOU DIDN’T. COME ON.

646
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:03,313
NO, IT’S TOO LATE.

647
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:08,017
NO, IT’S NOT TOO LATE. YOU STILL HAVE JULIAN.

648
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:09,919
HE'S STILL HERE.

649
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:13,389
LISTEN, YOU GUYS JUST NEED TO MAKE AMENDS, OKAY?

650
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:16,459
LET IT GO. IT’S TIME.

651
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:20,897
I DON'T DESERVE YOU. HOLD ME.

652
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:23,233
WE’RE HERE FOR EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

653
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:26,169
HOLD ME.

654
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,738
DON'T EVER LET ME GO.

655
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:31,741
I WON'T. I PROMISE.

656
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:41,150
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE TODAY.

657
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,418
DON’T YOU THINK IT WILL BE KIND OF AWKWARD

658
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:45,121
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED WITH CHANEL?

659
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:49,225
NO, WHY? MICHAEL ALREADY KNOWS WHAT SHE DID.

660
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,962
BUT WHAT ABOUT HER?

661
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:56,132
WHAT ABOUT HER? SHE'S THE ONE THAT CAME ON TO YOU.

662
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,068
LET'S JUST SEE HOW THINGS GO, OKAY?

663
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:04,807
ALL RIGHT. WELL, I’M HUNGRY. YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT?

664
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:06,209
YOU GO AHEAD. I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE.

665
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:31,968
YOU KNOW WHAT? CHANEL HAS SOMETHING SHE NEEDS TO TELL YOU.

666
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,005
GO AHEAD.

667
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:42,011
[SIGHS] I’M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT, OKAY?

668
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:45,181
IT WAS WRONG FOR ME TO DO WHAT I DID.

669
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:46,616
YOU’RE RIGHT.

670
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,318
HEY, SHE'S TRYING HERE, ALL RIGHT?

671
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:52,488
LOOK, IT’S OKAY.

672
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:56,225
I DON’T KNOW WHAT GOT INTO ME.

673
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:59,295
IF I HURT YOU IN ANY WAY, I APOLOGIZE.

674
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,702
HE'S STRAIGHT, ISN'T HE?

675
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:08,738
YEAH!

676
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:12,075
JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.

677
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:14,844
I MIGHT AS WELL GET THAT SUITCASE.

678
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:17,847
GOOD IDEA.

679
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:21,050
SO, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR TODAY?

680
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,254
I DON’T KNOW YET.

681
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,790
BUT I FIGURED, FINDING OUT WHAT MOM LET IN THE SUITCASE

682
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,892
IS A GOOD START.

683
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,967
SO, DO YOU KNOW THE COMBINATION TO THIS?

684
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,703
OH. MOM SAID TO LOOK BEHIND THE PHONE.

685
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:48,478
"666... " MM-HMM?

686
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:52,715
"568... 37-87."

687
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:55,485
THERE WE... [LATCH CLICKS]

688
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,887
OH, THERE IT IS!

689
01:00:57,887 --> 01:00:59,856
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

690
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:05,428
ALL RIGHT. LET’S SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE.

691
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:12,101
"DEAR MICHAEL AND JULIAN,

692
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:15,505
"I’D LIKE TO SAY THAT I LOVE YOU BOTH VERY MUCH...

693
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,975
"AND THAT I'LL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU IN SPIRIT.

694
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:22,545
"LIFE IS SO SHORT, WHAT CAN I SAY?

695
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:25,548
"I’VE BEEN BLESSED WITH BOTH OF YOU AND I’M HAPPY I WAS ABLE

696
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:28,785
"TO SEE YOU GROW UP INTO KIND, CARING ADULTS."

WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

868
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,075
I’M THE GUY WHO WORKED EIGHTY HOURS A WEEK

WHO PAID THE FUCKIN’ BILLS.

01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:01,483
WHO VISITED HER BECAUSE SHE HADN’T GOT A CALL FROM HER SON, MICHAEL,

872
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:03,485
IN SEVERAL MONTHS, AND SHE DIDN’T KNOW

873
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:05,220
IF HE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE?

874
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,189
HOW COULD I BE AROUND HER WHEN SHE CHOSE TO BE WITH YOU?

875
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:10,759
JULIAN THIS, AND JULIAN THAT. EVERYTHING WAS ALWAYS ABOUT YOU.

876
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:16,865
AND I WASN’T GOING TO SIT AROUND TO SEE YOU LIVE OUT YOUR FILTHY FUCKIN’ LIFESTYLE.

877
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,902
YOU MAKE ME SICK!

878
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:28,777
NICE TO KNOW HOW YOU REALLY FEEL, MICHAEL.
