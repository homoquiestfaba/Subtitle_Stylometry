1
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,422
Isn't it so cute?

2
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:37,965
Come on, it's so cute.

3
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,002
Take it home with you.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,297
It's super cute, isn't it?

5
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:41,884
Put it in.

6
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,127
Let go of them!

7
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,802
No! It's not me!

8
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:12,294
Who is she?

9
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,756
She's my biggest hero

10
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,010
on this planet-

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,126
my sister, Dan!

12
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:20,761
She's like a mysterious alien.

13
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:24,296
She's the best gift
the UFO brought to the Earth.

14
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,044
Even there is no future for us,

15
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,585
I still want to be with you.

16
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:28,925
This is our fate.

17
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:30,294
I don't love you anymore.

18
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:31,379
Please leave.

19
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:32,209
No!

20
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,344
Why can't you understand it?

21
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:37,214
There are so many things

22
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,881
that are beyond our control!

23
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,881
Ever since she was little

24
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:44,795
she's never liked any men apart from our dad.

25
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:46,044
She hates them.

26
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:48,590
But I don't know why.

27
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,302
Brothers! Kill them!

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,626
Kill them!

29
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:23,501
Dan has the magic power of a superwoman!

30
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:26,169
Everyone in our town knows that

31
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:28,886
Dan's energy erupts as soon as

32
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,128
she hears any girl calling for help.

33
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:33,794
She has a strong sense of justice.

34
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:36,841
Her superpower is invincible!

35
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,800
Don't bully girls.

36
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,965
Kick the stinky boys' asses.

37
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,960
Shave the bad men's armpits.

38
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,211
I for girls and girls for me!

39
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:53,919
Bad Girls, let's go!

40
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:08,089
Dan - a great fighter
with a strong sense of justice

41
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:16,418
Pei - knowledgeable and an expert in analysis

42
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:24,005
Mi - sweet, gentle and good at handcraft

43
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,504
They form the trio of "Bad Girls".

44
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,252
Girls united!

45
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,877
Fight the stinky boys!

46
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,344
So the responsibilities of fighting the evil

47
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,631
and keeping the peace in the universe

48
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,549
fall solely on her shoulders!

49
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,210
Who is she?

50
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,506
She is my dearest sister -

51
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,127
Dan!

52
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,670
Teachers and classmates,

53
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,003
here comes to the end of my speech

54
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,881
on "My Biggest Hero".

55
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,050
Thank you all.

56
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,134
Morning, Mom.

57
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,088
Morning.

58
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,173
Sweetie, would you like juice or milk?

59
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,794
I want this.

60
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,506
Hey, that's mine!

61
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,047
I won't wait for you,

62
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:50,918
if you don't hurry up.

63
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,714
Mom, look!

64
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,005
She's doing it again!

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,126
I'll going to tell Dad about it.

66
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:58,044
Sweetie, be nice to your sis, alright?

67
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,380
No!

68
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,376
Anyway Dad's working in Taipei.

69
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,627
He won't be back for another month.

70
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,551
Suit yourself.

71
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,593
Hurry up! Bye!

72
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,676
Sis, wait for me!

73
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,089
Hey, here are soft-boiled eggs!

74
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,127
Sis, are we going there today?

75
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,551
Of course! Come on!

76
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,717
It's such a lovely day!

77
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:15,509
Right,

78
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,173
maybe something nice will happen.

79
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,885
Well, I would hope so.

80
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,425
Get out of my way, please!

81
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,302
Gosh, it's such a long queue.

82
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:34,168
Come on.

83
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:34,588
Get in the queue.

84
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,675
Come on, off you go!

85
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,175
Great!

86
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,760
Spring onion bread fresh from the oven!

87
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:43,671
Not again!

88
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,669
I can't see what's good
about spring onion bread.

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,967
Well, you'll never get it.

90
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,175
Anyway, it's yummy!

91
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:50,885
There seems to be plenty left.

92
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,256
Give me my bread back!

93
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:03,592
Give it back!

94
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:06,584
Take it

95
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:07,213
Who are you?

96
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,460
How dare you snatch my bread!

97
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:10,793
You, crazy woman!

98
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:12,044
Give me the bread back!

99
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,719
%*@$#&%@?

100
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:15,467
What?

101
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:16,543
She says,

102
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:19,546
"How dare you bully a little girl? "

103
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:20,168
Mind your own business

104
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,261
or I'll ask my dad to beat you up.

105
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:28,292
%*@$#&%@!

106
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,920
Justice is on our side.

107
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,966
Hmph! See if you dare to do it again?

108
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:39,967
Give it to me.

109
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,505
Come! Here you are.

110
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:43,584
Good girl.

111
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,380
Thank you.

112
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:47,009
And mine?

113
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,590
Wow, spring onion bread!

114
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,257
Sis, we'll be late for school.

115
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,342
Hurry UP!

116
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:07,419
Look!

117
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:08,709
Shut up!

118
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,335
Can't you just let me enjoy the bread?

119
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,009
You really love to be on time, don't you?

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,967
Go!

121
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,090
Yeah, Justin went to practice in the bakery

122
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,302
early in the morning.

123
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:26,509
Yes,

124
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,592
we just left.

125
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,550
We're on the way.

126
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,923
Well, you look great on the cover.

127
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,126
Jusfin,

128
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,840
you've learned everything about the shooting?

129
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,752
Yes, I have.

130
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,251
Well...

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,343
I really can't understand

132
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:47,636
why you love this script so much.

133
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,968
There are so many layers in this story.

134
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,003
If I want to become a real actor,

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,128
I need to try different roles.

136
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,085
I don't want to be just a pop idol.

137
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,468
You'll bump into a wall if you keep reading!

138
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,050
What are you doing?

139
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:13,918
Give it back to me!

140
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:15,009
Jump higher!

141
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,300
- Huang Dan-Chi! -Higher!

142
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:17,384
Okay, here you are.

143
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:18,589
You can't understand a word in it.

144
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:19,459
Hey!

145
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,335
I nearly fell over.

146
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,425
Hey, I'm sorry.

147
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:23,759
Dan!

148
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:25,879
What's it?

149
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,880
Ah,

150
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,927
this is the so-called "confession".

151
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:32,884
Confession?

152
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,505
Really? You're so lucky!

153
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,502
Dan, someone has fallen for you.

154
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,090
Idiot! Is he looking for trouble?

155
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,009
Headmaster.

156
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:49,091
This is a very nice school.

157
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,422
It feels spacious...

158
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:52,509
bright...

159
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,717
...and comfortable.

160
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,423
But...

161
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,218
It lacks...

162
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:58,925
the soul.

163
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:00,134
What? The soul?

164
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:00,963
Well, Headmaster...

165
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,380
Isn't it better not to have a soul?

166
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,585
What the director means is

167
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,460
your school has a unique style of its own

168
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:09,419
and it'll serve as the inspiration
for his work.

169
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,217
Oh, inspiration!

170
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,709
Director, you're right.

171
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,672
It's such a beautiful place.

172
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,502
It's as pretty as a postcard.

173
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,260
Besides, people are very friendly here.

174
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,505
If the film could boost tourism

175
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,843
in a rural town

176
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,551
like ours,

177
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:24,590
I'll be so grateful to you.

178
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,335
I'll give you the thumbs up.

179
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,630
You're more than welcome.

180
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,423
I wonder who the lead actor is

181
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,501
in this film.

182
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:34,511
He's the hottest pop idol - Justin!

183
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,376
Jusfin,

184
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,968
walk slowly.

185
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,422
Walk in slow motion.

186
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:53,045
Kill them with your eyes!

187
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:12,385
Wow, what's going on here?

188
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,752
Is it a goddess procession?

189
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,218
Pei, who is that guy?

190
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,551
Don't you know him?

191
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,045
He's the No.1 pop idol in Asia.

192
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:21,136
The best lead actor in romantic movies.

193
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,718
He is Justin!

194
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,461
Oh, the one who sings "Baby, baby"?

195
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,256
Not that one! Dan!

196
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,093
He's the one we all fancy!

197
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:29,838
You know what?

198
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,881
I've got his photo album, posters...

199
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:32,967
And...

200
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,677
the lip balm he advertises!

201
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,967
I even joined his fan club.

202
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,175
Let me see.

203
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:42,089
Wow, I can't believe it!

204
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,335
Isn't it bit too much?

205
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,301
Why am I the only one who doesn't know him?

206
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,752
Hey, Dan, you can't use it!

207
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:48,509
You'll ruin it!

208
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,128
Give it back to me!

209
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,877
Huang Dan-Chi!

210
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:59,421
Wow, he's really a superstar!

211
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,795
Yeah, super popular!

212
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:03,925
Even there weren't so many people

213
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:05,260
at my political rally!

214
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,669
This is just the beginning.

215
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,006
When the film is released,

216
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,877
it'll cause even more sensation here.

217
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,459
Excuse me.

218
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,755
Can you tell me

219
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,377
what the film is about?

220
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,258
It's based on a true love story

221
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,423
which happened in the 1980s.

222
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,004
A boy and a girl who trained as athletes.

223
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,252
As they trained together,

224
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,050
they gradually fell in love with each other.

225
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,169
I feel so tired

226
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:38,169
as we have to practice every day.

227
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,131
I train with you every day.

228
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,419
We run on the same track.

229
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,795
We breathe the same air.

230
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,633
But I have to keep reading your mind.

231
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,594
I feel so tired...

232
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,051
so tired...

233
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,635
So so tired.

234
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:00,842
Don't worry.

235
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,423
You won't feel tired if you enjoy it.

236
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,550
Cut!

237
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,714
Good!

238
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,710
Very good!

239
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,968
Jessica,

240
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,292
you successfully portray

241
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,386
the shyness and the longing of the girl.

242
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,001
Okay.

243
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,004
Let's move on to the "vaulting box" scene!

244
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:22,589
Good. Let's go.

245
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,297
Action!

246
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:34,418
Cut.

247
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:37,963
Cut.

248
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,467
Cut.

249
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,384
Cut.

250
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,797
Where has your agility gone?

251
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,755
Where has the beautiful curve gone?

252
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,006
You totally wasted your training in gymnastics!

253
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,131
After all, can you do it?

254
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,544
Okay, all actors, take a break.

255
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,550
We'll resume shooting later.

256
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,126
Hey,

257
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,342
would you like to come to mine for dinner?

258
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,381
I can't. I need to write an essay.

259
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:02,543
It's summer vacation!

260
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,509
What essay do you need to write?

261
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:06,419
Princeton Science asked me to do it.

262
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:07,918
Ask Mi instead.

263
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,627
But I need to get some yarns.

264
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,834
I would be a little bit late...

265
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,171
Hey,

266
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:14,669
what's wrong with you guys?

267
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,675
It's summer vacation.

268
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,010
How can you be so busy?

269
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:17,879
Anyway)'

270
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,468
we all live in the same street.

271
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,630
You must show up tonight.

272
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,504
Did you get it?

273
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,753
Hey, who is this kid?

274
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,343
Hey, you're so slow!

275
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,751
Huang Dan-Chi.

276
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:28,759
I...

277
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:31,339
I need to talk to you.

278
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,504
Get out of my way!

279
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,005
I know... it's rather sudden,

280
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,293
but I really like...

281
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:48,794
Are you looking for trouble?

282
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,135
How dare you touch me!

283
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,800
Wow!

284
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:56,010
What?

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,468
What are you laughing at?

286
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,171
You're in love?

287
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:01,261
I'm going to tell Mom.

288
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,126
You!

289
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,880
You'll be dead meat if you dare to tell her.

290
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,172
No, I won't.

291
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,259
I'm not afraid of you!

292
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:07,834
You!

293
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,009
You can't catch me!

294
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,422
Stop running!

295
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,342
Come back!

296
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:12,088
Hang in there.

297
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,005
Let's consider it again.

298
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,047
We don't have to do vaulting box.

299
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,422
How about hopscotch? Will it do?

300
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,797
No, it has to be vaulting box.

301
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,717
But we're stuck here.

302
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,631
If we really can't do vaulting box...

303
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:21,842
We can't go on like this.

304
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,301
Shall we skip it and move on to the next scene?

305
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:24,168
What do you think?

306
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:24,793
No, not the next scene.

307
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,965
This scene comes first. We'll try again.

308
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,130
Come back!

309
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,543
You cheeky monkey!

310
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,334
Get out of my way.

311
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,043
Stop running.

312
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,717
You cheeky monkey!

313
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,005
You're so naughty.

314
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,967
Get out of my way.

315
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,544
Come get me!

316
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,547
You...

317
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:50,089
You're so naughty.

318
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,756
You can't get me!

319
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:52,129
Slop!

320
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,126
Stop running.

321
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,672
Come get me!

322
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:18,260
What is my Justin doing here?!

323
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:02,834
You again!

324
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:04,004
Huang Dan-Chi!

325
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,844
You're such a trouble-maker!

326
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,128
I didn't mean it!

327
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,630
She was lying on the floor.

328
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,877
Who would see her?

329
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,427
He)', young girl.

330
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,047
You've got such an attitude, yeah?

331
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,170
It's all your fault that the accident happened.

332
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,635
You hurt our Jessica.

333
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,335
How are you going to compensate us?

334
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,793
Compensate?

335
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:26,509
Why should I compensate?

336
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,253
Justin turned down all other films

337
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:31,089
just for this one.

338
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,085
He even put in his own money.

339
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,927
Now the lead actress is seriously injured.

340
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:37,714
How are we going to carry on shooting?

341
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:40,466
Hey, what's the big deal? It's just a movie!

342
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,169
Besides,

343
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:43,544
she is just a decorative vase.

344
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,175
A vase?

345
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,585
You have to mend the vase since you broke it!

346
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,880
Fine, bring it to me!

347
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,593
You're being so unreasonable!

348
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,175
So what?

349
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:51,918
How about you?

350
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:54,588
What?

351
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,379
Me?

352
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,548
You stand in, as compensation.

353
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:58,921
What?

354
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,251
I...

355
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,175
Are you scared?

356
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,715
Justin, you know what you're talking about?

357
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,047
You got to be kidding me!

358
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,673
No problem. I trust my judgment.

359
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:11,465
Besides, my contract allows me

360
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,381
to choose the lead actress, right?

361
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:15,213
Director,

362
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:17,965
I can do with her!

363
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,840
I...

364
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,298
I can do with her too.

365
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,504
She can do it.

366
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:31,634
- Yes, she can! -No...

367
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,467
Are you serious?

368
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,672
Huang Dan-Chi,

369
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,630
since the summer vacation begins tomorrow

370
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,343
do your best.

371
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,131
If you mess it up...

372
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,795
I'll ask your mother to come to school.

373
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:44,793
Okay, everything settled.

374
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,009
Let's have tea next door.

375
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,217
Let's go.

376
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:50,043
Sir...

377
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,547
That's it.

378
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,131
Dan, what are you going to do?

379
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,342
You'll be in a film!

380
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,833
The film tells a story of a boy and a girl

381
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,336
who train as athletes.

382
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,837
They train happily together.

383
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,712
One day the boy gets injured
and feels depressed.

384
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,130
But with your encouragement,

385
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,253
he later becomes a great baker.

386
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,551
But Dan,

387
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:26,135
it's a romantic film.

388
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,261
Can you really act?

389
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,051
It's all your fault!

390
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:35,384
Hey,

391
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,377
she gets to play with my Justin!

392
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,969
If she's afraid, I can do it for her.

393
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:43,589
I'm not afraid!

394
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:44,839
A romantic film?

395
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,460
Isn't it all about falling in love?

396
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:47,839
Why should I be afraid of it?

397
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,885
But sis,

398
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,843
have you ever fallen in love?

399
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,468
Oh!

400
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,176
This thing makes my scalp so itchy.

401
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:06,885
What are you trying to do?

402
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,627
Hey,

403
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:14,465
do you know you're a girl?

404
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:17,011
Of course! I know I'm a girl.

405
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,173
And my name is Dan,

406
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,010
not "hey".

407
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:22,588
Okay)'

408
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,675
Dan.

409
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:26,090
May I ask you a question?

410
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:31,421
Why did you get yourself into such a state?

411
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,381
Your hair is as dry as a kitchen sponge.

412
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:35,634
Your eyebrows...

413
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,673
...look like caterpillars.

414
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,044
And your muscles...

415
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:42,295
...look like a bodybuilder's!

416
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,210
Call yourself the leading lady?!

417
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,251
Spare me the torture, please!

418
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,176
Hey, why are you so mean to me?

419
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:49,714
At least I'm really healthy.

420
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,551
And...

421
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,759
I'm not ugly.

422
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:53,796
Well,

423
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,755
Forget about it.

424
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,376
What?

425
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:14,884
You! Pervert!

426
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,005
Looking for trouble?

427
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,551
You hit my face!

428
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:22,834
Stop running!

429
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:24,259
Come back!

430
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,172
Stay away from me!

431
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,840
Get her!

432
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,422
Stay away from me!

433
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:31,135
Don't hit me.

434
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,922
I'm going to kill you all!

435
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,926
Assistant director,

436
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,547
I've done my best.

437
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,047
Where is my sis?

438
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,923
Hmm... it's alright.

439
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:17,964
Alright? What do you mean?

440
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:18,550
For Christ's sake,

441
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:20,715
I always know I'm beautiful.

442
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:23,294
Beautiful?

443
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,169
If you become famous,

444
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,044
I'll be your servant!

445
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:31,795
You never get it.

446
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:33,465
You won't make it...

447
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,425
In this scene,

448
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:40,301
you gradually fall in love with each other

449
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,960
as you spend so much time together.

450
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:43,675
Dan,

451
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,549
give me a cute subtle smile.

452
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,593
Be subtle.

453
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,130
Don't too much, okay?

454
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,547
Oh...

455
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:55,134
Okay.

456
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,465
Get ready.

457
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,961
Okay, everyone ready?

458
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:06,590
Action!

459
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,459
Cut.

460
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:41,458
Dan,

461
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,801
What's wrong with your face?

462
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,335
I'm trying to look cute.

463
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:45,339
What's wrong?

464
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:49,126
Didn't I ask you to put on a cute subtle smile

465
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:52,550
when you steal a glance of Justin?

466
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:54,089
Yes, subtle...

467
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:54,549
Look,

468
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:55,509
I steal the glance...

469
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,628
Subtle...

470
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,751
Don't I look cute?

471
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,593
You call it cute?

472
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,836
You thought it was easy to be an actress?

473
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,384
None of your business!

474
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,968
I'm playing a young athlete.

475
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:12,135
They should compete on the tracks.

476
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,468
Whoever wins falls for the other.

477
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,550
Stop pretending to be cute.

478
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:15,259
Stealing a glance?

479
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,172
I'm not a pervert!

480
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:18,134
Director,

481
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,672
so I've told you!

482
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,386
You should find some new actress.

483
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:25,090
She does nothing but delays the progress.

484
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,424
Then I'll just take Justin away from the mess.

485
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:30,959
Okay.

486
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,710
Let's have a race.

487
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,418
Ah?

488
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,377
See?

489
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,299
Justin, why are you speaking up for her?

490
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:40,544
Since the girl is a young athlete,

491
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:42,965
it makes sense...

492
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,585
if she leaves their fate

493
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,880
to running.

494
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,334
Director,

495
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:49,300
what do you think?

496
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:51,834
Okay.

497
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:54,302
Let's change it to "running for love".

498
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,297
Yes!

499
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:56,509
Let's go.

500
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,461
I didn't know you need
so many people in the crew.

501
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,051
Yeah, I guess

502
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:06,464
there are at least one hundred people here.

503
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:09,007
They never finish their lunch boxes.

504
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,844
But I never leave anything in mine.

505
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,464
After all, I'm still growing.

506
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:15,960
Look how busy they are!

507
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,380
I wonder what they're busy with.

508
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,594
They're busy with nothing!

509
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,252
Damn!

510
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,884
What the hell are you doing?

511
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,843
Don't you know you can't walk on that?

512
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:41,177
But this is really heavy.

513
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,752
Give it to me.

514
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:50,551
See? Go get some training!

515
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:52,715
Put it down!

516
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:56,380
Sit down.

517
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,968
What are you doing?

518
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,799
Why did you help them move the equipment?

519
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:03,840
That's their job.

520
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,427
You're the leading lady.

521
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:08,714
What if you get injured?

522
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,676
How can I possibly get injured?

523
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:11,839
Besides, how can I ignore them

524
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,426
when them need help?

525
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,003
You were intervening!

526
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:18,294
Film-making is all about collaboration.

527
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:20,010
Everyone has his job in the crew.

528
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:22,256
You're the leading lady.

529
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,593
You should memorize all the lines.

530
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:24,800
Focus on acting.

531
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,135
If you help them move the equipment,

532
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,001
you'll get sweaty, right?

533
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,502
Then I have to do your make-up again, right?

534
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,049
Isn't it a waste of time for everyone?

535
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,377
So from now on,

536
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,377
come back as soon as you finish shooting.

537
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,343
And go shooting from here.

538
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,505
Don't go anywhere else.

539
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,968
DO you get it?

540
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,878
Change the clothes!

541
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,426
Yes, here we are!

542
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,002
No! It's me!

543
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:50,340
Not her!

544
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,968
Don't touch!

545
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,093
Cut!

546
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:01,385
Another take.

547
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,209
Cut!

548
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,176
Another take.

549
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:18,209
Cut!

550
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,127
What's wrong with you?

551
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,877
How many times have I told you?

552
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:29,003
The most important thing in this scene

553
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,295
is when you are training

554
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:33,260
the boy's encouragement makes you

555
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,003
fall in love with running.

556
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,673
I want to see passion in your eyes.

557
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:41,466
Passion!

558
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,051
Do you understand?

559
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,002
Alright...

560
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,339
Hey, Dumb!

561
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:53,384
I'm Dan!

562
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,002
How many times do I have to say?

563
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:56,630
Whatever.

564
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,002
Dumb,

565
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:00,759
if you keep running like this,

566
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,502
we'll never finish the scene.

567
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,677
Do you understand what passion means?

568
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,379
Sir, I'm running out of energy.

569
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:10,672
How am I going to find passion?

570
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,551
Making films is so boring...

571
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:14,543
I'm starving...

572
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,010
How many times do I have to run?

573
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:18,051
When are we going to have lunch?

574
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,134
I'm starving.

575
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,342
Okay. Come on, get ready.

576
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:22,885
Not again.

577
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:34,050
Camera.

578
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,876
Action.

579
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:41,759
Cut!

580
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,836
Okay!

581
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,464
Dan!

582
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:53,051
Where are you going?

583
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,550
Hey, you!

584
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:55,464
Get her back!

585
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:56,209
Yes!

586
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,467
Dan, here is your lunch box.

587
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:06,584
Thank you.

588
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,050
Mr. Justin, here is yours.

589
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,592
What's wrong?

590
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,218
I've no appetite.

591
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:33,716
Well, I've got a great appetite!

592
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:39,011
So according to my analysis,

593
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:42,091
he's absolutely a weirdo.

594
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,593
Exactly!

595
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,005
He's really a weirdo.

596
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:48,006
Once what's-his-name brought him a lunch box.

597
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:49,843
He didn't even touch it.

598
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,922
Really?

599
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:53,261
They said the stars are temperamental.

600
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,923
That's right. He was being temperamental.

601
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:57,714
Every time

602
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,005
when the director thinks it's okay

603
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,423
he always insists on having another take.

604
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:02,626
Cut!

605
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:03,968
Okay.

606
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:07,297
Director,

607
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:08,134
One more take.

608
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,631
So he must be really annoying.

609
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,469
Oh, there is someone even more annoying.

610
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,301
Cut!

611
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:20,375
Hey, do you know how to act?

612
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:23,458
Please don't block Justin from the view.

613
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:25,085
Please!

614
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:44,377
Hey, catch it.

615
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,176
Good!

616
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:48,800
What is it?

617
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:51,841
Breakfast! I'm being really nice to you, right?

618
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:53,759
I can see that.

619
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,673
I mean why you brought me breakfast.

620
00:30:56,792 --> 00:30:58,044
Thank you for the yummy bread

621
00:30:58,042 --> 00:31:00,010
the other day.

622
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,126
You know that, right?

623
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,427
I'm still growing. I feel hungry all the time.

624
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,797
This is to say thank you,

625
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:06,669
so take it.

626
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:23,759
Wow!

627
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:26,590
Wow!

628
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,214
This is what you call "food".

629
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:33,169
Wow, it's so good!

630
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:39,505
It's not fair!

631
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,468
Why do you have a trailer full of food?

632
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:42,584
I want the food, too!

633
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,882
I did a lot of research on bread for this film.

634
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,343
I think these are alright.

635
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:49,335
If you like them, take them all.

636
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:50,629
Really?

637
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,092
Can I really have them?

638
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:53,839
Can I have all of them?

639
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:55,384
You're already eating.

640
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,214
Well, yeah.

641
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,377
Thank you.

642
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,922
Hey,

643
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:04,716
I think you make them for your own sake.

644
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:07,670
Alright, whatever you say.

645
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:09,168
Hey,

646
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:11,169
why don't you want people to know about it?

647
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:13,753
You're being temperamental!

648
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,672
Me?

649
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:15,793
Being temperamental?

650
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:18,215
Yeah, my friends say that

651
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,131
stars love being temperamental

652
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,217
and mysterious.

653
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,835
You're all so weird.

654
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,968
Last time what's-his-name brought you lunch.

655
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:25,925
But you didn't even touch it.

656
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:27,385
I saw it!

657
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,510
When everything mixes together,

658
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,843
it loses its taste.

659
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,506
That shows you don't respect food.

660
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,171
But you mix everything in your tummy anyway.

661
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,836
Attention, please.

662
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,336
On the last day of the summer camp,

663
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,756
we're going to have a potluck.

664
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:53,380
Please bring a dessert you make

665
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,628
with your family

666
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:59,633
and we'll see whose is the best.

667
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,253
Yes.

668
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:13,003
Hsi, as for the potluck...

669
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,798
what are you going to make with your family?

670
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:15,884
I...

671
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,252
I'm not sure yet.

672
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:20,465
My mom's cheese cake is the best.

673
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:24,008
She says it's made of the cheese from the Alps!

674
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,923
It smells so nice.

675
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:27,797
That's nothing!

676
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:30,386
My sis makes green tea and red bean cake.

677
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,922
You'll never forget

678
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:34,420
how smooth it feels

679
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:36,465
in your mouth.

680
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:40,547
Hmph! Nothing beats my mom's

681
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:42,670
taro and honey macaroons.

682
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,135
Take a bite and

683
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,503
the tastes of taro and honey

684
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,752
mix in your month.

685
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,299
The sweetness never goes away!

686
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:53,215
Hsi, how about you?

687
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,502
Okay.

688
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,551
Breathe out.

689
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,460
Do you feel better now?

690
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:18,427
Baby, what's wrong?

691
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,710
Mom... can you make cake?

692
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,506
You want some cake?

693
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,459
Well... the teacher at the summer camp asks us

694
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:29,337
to bring a dessert we make with our family.

695
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,091
Okay)'

696
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:32,300
Mom will make it for you tomorrow.

697
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,093
Great.

698
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:36,965
But, can you really make it?

699
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,711
Don't worry. I can make anything.

700
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,002
Flour.

701
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,334
Okay, baby. Water.

702
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,380
Pass the water to me.

703
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:01,011
Keep beating it until it gets really smooth.

704
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:20,385
The last one.

705
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,673
Here we are!

706
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:31,835
It's done.

707
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:40,589
Mom...

708
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,506
Isn't it Chinese pastry?

709
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,961
It's cake as long as it has egg in it, right?

710
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,757
How can you call it cake?

711
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:57,253
Do you want to become a baker?

712
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:57,671
Yes.

713
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:58,463
You do?

714
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,594
Do you know why we have
to roll the dough like this?

715
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:02,838
No, I don't.

716
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:03,675
No?

717
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,050
Because

718
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:08,171
it'll make the bread taste smoother.

719
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,464
It'll make it more delicious.

720
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,377
Be delicious.

721
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:14,464
Dad, what are you doing?

722
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:16,256
I'm talking to the dough.

723
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,672
Why are you talking to it?

724
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,590
The dough is a living thing.

725
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:21,085
If we want people who eat the bread

726
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,585
to feel our good will,

727
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:25,302
we can tell the dough about it.

728
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:26,501
Really?

729
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,468
You can give it a try.

730
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:31,419
Be delicious!

731
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:36,175
Is it good?

732
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:37,669
Yes, it's so good.

733
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,672
Director,

734
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,006
I really can't burst into tears.

735
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,843
Why should I cry while nothing happens to me?

736
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,001
What's-his-name!

737
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:19,590
Try to make her cry!

738
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:22,709
Director, it's done.

739
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:23,675
Keep rolling.

740
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:25,797
Action.

741
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,092
Director,

742
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,255
it's dried up!

743
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:36,755
Cut!

744
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:46,714
It's not working.

745
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,002
Cut!

746
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,343
Very good!

747
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:30,794
Okay. N ext.

748
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,968
I didn't expect

749
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:40,551
Justin to be so smart.

750
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,919
He even discovered that

751
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:45,011
food is Dan's biggest weakness.

752
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,635
Really?

753
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,465
I think...

754
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:53,880
Dan's just after the food.

755
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,294
I don't think she's in love.

756
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,710
In love?

757
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,176
Huang Dan-Chi,

758
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:06,589
who are you in love with?

759
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:10,251
How about me?

760
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:12,334
Huang Dan-Chi!

761
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,505
Here I come!

762
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,376
You again?

763
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:29,463
No.

764
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:32,177
Dan can't be in love with my Justin.

765
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:34,511
We have find out more about it.

766
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,593
Kick the stinky boys' asses.

767
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,506
Shave the bad men's armpits.

768
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,753
I for girls and girls for me!

769
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,969
Bad Girls, let's go!

770
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:07,132
Wow! What is it?

771
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:09,969
It's my first time to see
a trailer full of desserts.

772
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:11,959
Be serious, you guys!

773
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:14,169
This trailer full of food

774
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:16,465
definitely holds the key to

775
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,881
Justin's control over Dan.

776
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,468
Let's destroy it!

777
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,085
Ready?

778
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:23,460
Yes, Captain!

779
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:28,301
It's so yummy!

780
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,839
Work harder!

781
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:52,922
In this scene,

782
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,295
Justin would confess his love for you.

783
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,753
Then he'll hold you.

784
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:00,381
You should look a little shocked

785
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,924
and a little shy.

786
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:04,259
Just a little.

787
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,843
Don't too much, okay?

788
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:07,418
Okay.

789
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:09,425
Come on.

790
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,130
Shy?

791
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,342
Ready!

792
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,672
What are you laughing at?

793
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:17,839
You're scared, right?

794
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:20,834
Do your best, okay?

795
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,301
Ready, steady, 90!

796
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,551
62A-6 take01.

797
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:31,050
Action!

798
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,878
Mu-Yun, it's such a lovely day.

799
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:38,919
Thank you for inviting me out.

800
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:40,709
Yeah.

801
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,670
The beautiful weather reminds me of you.

802
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:48,294
Look! Seagulls!

803
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,342
Yes, seagulls!

804
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,626
Wow!

805
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,840
They look as happy as we are.

806
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:57,047
You know what?

807
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,876
In the past three years,

808
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:03,216
I felt there was a knot in my heart
that I could never untie it...

809
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:04,714
What knot?

810
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:08,052
It's a very complicated feeling.

811
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:11,011
A feeling...

812
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,128
...that I can't explain.

813
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,002
But it just happened.

814
00:42:15,542 --> 00:42:19,092
It made my heart race all the time.

815
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:21,130
But I couldn't control it.

816
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:27,675
I felt so painful

817
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:30,968
until I saw your smile.

818
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:33,425
Then I realized that

819
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:36,841
it's all because of you.

820
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:38,884
Because of me?

821
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:42,084
Because...

822
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:45,710
I like you.

823
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,547
Cut.

824
00:43:58,792 --> 00:44:00,886
You must be hungry.

825
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:03,135
Mom.

826
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:15,467
Mom.

827
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:16,300
What?

828
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:18,510
Can I ask you a question?

829
00:44:19,917 --> 00:44:23,251
What does it mean

830
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,218
when a boy...

831
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:26,300
...kisses a girl?

832
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:30,883
That means the boy likes the girl.

833
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:34,505
But...

834
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:37,420
...the boy usually pays no attention

835
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:38,919
to the girl.

836
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,175
Besides,

837
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:43,216
you can't tell the boy likes the girl at all.

838
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,674
Well,

839
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:48,425
maybe as they spend a lot of time together

840
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:51,341
the boy gradually becomes
attracted to the girl.

841
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,006
Then they fall in love with each other.

842
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:56,293
Really?

843
00:44:57,958 --> 00:44:59,255
FaHin love?

844
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:01,793
Mom.

845
00:45:02,417 --> 00:45:04,169
What does it mean, fall in love?

846
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:09,136
I don't know what it means either.

847
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,677
I just know

848
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,920
I feel so happy every time...

849
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:17,303
when I see your dad finish the food I cook

850
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:20,295
and smile with satisfaction.

851
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:37,506
So...

852
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:40,545
that's what falling in love means.

853
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,344
What is love like?

854
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,712
Love is like Sunday morning.

855
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:01,677
What is love like?

856
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:05,001
Love is like embracing the wind.

857
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:08,965
What is love like?

858
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:12,337
Love is like a dream in purple.

859
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:16,302
What is love like?

860
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:19,671
Love is like an eye that talks.

861
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,594
What is love like?

862
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:26,962
Love is like Sunday morning.

863
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:30,927
What is love like?

864
00:46:30,917 --> 00:46:34,296
Love is like embracing the wind.

865
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:38,261
What is love like?

866
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,629
Love is like a dream in purple.

867
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,594
What is love like?

868
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:48,962
Love is like an eye that talks.

869
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:57,215
Let waves shake the sadness in my heart.

870
00:46:57,583 --> 00:47:00,757
Let them wash my sadness away.

871
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,594
No longer worries.

872
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:08,011
Let the boat drift away

873
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,584
from the memories of the past.

874
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:15,208
The boat is loaded with love

875
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:18,587
and sails towards the sea.

876
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:27,464
What is love like?

877
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,761
Thank you all!

878
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,334
Come on! Come on!

879
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:46,340
Why is Dan cooking?

880
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:49,961
She says she's cooking for Justin.

881
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:51,714
Jusfin?

882
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:53,881
Why?

883
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,506
It doesn't make any sense at all.

884
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,342
Mom,

885
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:00,926
shall we help her?

886
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:03,843
I don't dare.

887
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:08,051
Mom!

888
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,960
I'm great, right?

889
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:36,460
You again?

890
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:38,176
Aren't you tired?

891
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:40,010
I can't let you pass.

892
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,627
You'll be cheated by that man.

893
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:46,011
What has it got to do with you?

894
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:50,751
I'm the only one who truly loves you...

895
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,843
Hello!

896
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,335
What are you doing here?

897
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:12,459
I'm taking you to lunch.

898
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:14,176
Come on, let's go.

899
00:49:29,542 --> 00:49:31,670
I'm sure you didn't make it.

900
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:33,294
How did you know?

901
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:36,006
Look at the food.

902
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,173
A flower made of carrot?

903
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:39,089
You're so rough.

904
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,380
How could you possibly make it?

905
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:41,334
Hey,

906
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:42,960
don't be so mean.

907
00:49:43,542 --> 00:49:44,509
You're a good actor

908
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,423
because you've been acting
since you were young.

909
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:48,135
Unlike me,

910
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:50,298
I've cooked only a few times.

911
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:53,051
Don't mention it.

912
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:55,756
They aren't happy memories.

913
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:04,838
Cut.

914
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,297
Cut!

915
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:13,925
Can we do it again?

916
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:21,044
I envy you

917
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:22,510
because you had a happy childhood.

918
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:25,718
Weren't you happy when you were a child?

919
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:34,092
My mom died when I was very young.

920
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:36,960
My dad gave up a well-paid job

921
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,715
for his dream.

922
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:42,669
He opened a bakery.

923
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,668
But later

924
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,175
he worked himself to death.

925
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,968
My uncle, Matthew, is the only family I have.

926
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:03,341
He's been looking after me since then.

927
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,218
I'll never forget my dad's expressions

928
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:11,214
when he was making bread.

929
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:15,127
He must have been really happy.

930
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:19,794
In fact, if you want,

931
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,094
you could do things you like.

932
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:25,584
I can't.

933
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:27,965
Like now I have to go to the shooting.

934
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,126
Who says so?

935
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:32,876
Come with me!

936
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:33,876
Come on!

937
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:34,717
Let's go!

938
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:38,084
What are you doing?

939
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:39,050
Hurry UP!

940
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:39,918
Hey,

941
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:41,293
where are we going?

942
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:42,214
Quiet!

943
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:46,342
Hey...

944
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,468
Stop asking questions!

945
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:54,459
Hey,

946
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:55,584
where on earth are we going?

947
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:56,835
Come on!

948
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,092
Here we are!

949
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:02,209
What do you think?

950
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:03,300
It's great, isn't it?

951
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:15,002
I want to eat as much as I can!

952
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:17,419
Hey, why did you do that?

953
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:20,506
Well, isn't it what people do in the movies?

954
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,253
You shout your wish out loud!

955
00:52:24,417 --> 00:52:25,634
Does it work?

956
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:27,255
Of course it does!

957
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:28,922
Every time when I shout it out loud

958
00:52:28,917 --> 00:52:30,919
my parents over there will hear it

959
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:33,170
and grant my wish!

960
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:35,379
For Christ's sake,

961
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:36,547
it sounds so silly.

962
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:39,464
Not at all.

963
00:52:40,542 --> 00:52:41,885
My dad often says

964
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:45,341
you have to shout your mind out loud.

965
00:52:45,792 --> 00:52:46,884
He tells us that

966
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:50,132
it doesn't matter

967
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:50,751
even if no one believes in you.

968
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,423
As long as you believe in yourself,
that's enough.

969
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:55,301
He also says

970
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:56,919
only when you're

971
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:58,385
being yourself

972
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,797
can you be happy-

973
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:08,968
This must be quite difficult.

974
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:10,550
Not at all.

975
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:13,044
How would you know if you've never tried?

976
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:21,176
Are you always so carefree?

977
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:23,009
Of course not!

978
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:25,135
I've got so much to worry about.

979
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:28,460
In fact...

980
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:33,591
...I'm adopted.

981
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,674
My dad was worried that I'd be bullied

982
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:43,010
so he teaches me Kungfu.

983
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:46,173
He hopes I'll be stronger

984
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:48,676
so I can protect myself.

985
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,085
I want to be stronger!

986
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,676
I want to be myself!

987
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:25,927
I want to be happier!

988
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:29,461
I want to eat a lot of spring onion bread!

989
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:34,292
I want cake not Chinese pastry!

990
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:39,042
I want to break 700 million at the box office.

991
00:54:39,917 --> 00:54:41,089
Sis,

992
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:44,799
what were you doing with my Justin
on the bridge?

993
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:46,505
Nothing...

994
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,719
We were just rehearsing.

995
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,092
Ouch!

996
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:54,131
What are you doing? It really hurts!

997
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,253
If you don't tell the truth,
I'll tell Mom about it.

998
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:57,213
Hey,

999
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:59,335
pinch me again and I won't make cake for you.

1000
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:00,801
You'll get in trouble at school.

1001
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:02,717
Please, sis!

1002
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:04,130
Please help me!

1003
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:05,425
Okay.

1004
00:55:06,542 --> 00:55:09,170
But can you really make it?

1005
00:55:10,542 --> 00:55:11,714
Don't worry.

1006
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,585
I can make anything!

1007
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:23,381
Uncle, this is for you.

1008
00:55:24,542 --> 00:55:25,384
I made it myself...

1009
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:26,501
Sit down, Justin.

1010
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:32,465
What's going on

1011
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:33,960
between you and the girl?

1012
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:36,339
Nothing.

1013
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,047
We're just friends.

1014
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:39,084
Fﬂends?

1015
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:41,714
Then you must be

1016
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,343
such good friends

1017
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:44,801
that you kissed her and went on a date.

1018
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:50,961
I won't stop you seeing girls.

1019
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:52,968
But have you ever thought

1020
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:55,552
why that bumpkin wants to get close to you?

1021
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:57,259
It's for your own good!

1022
00:55:57,708 --> 00:55:58,755
Uncle,

1023
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:00,551
don't assume everyone

1024
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:01,384
who wants to be friends with me is bad.

1025
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:03,544
I've the rights to choose my friends

1026
00:56:03,792 --> 00:56:05,385
and things I want to do, right?

1027
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,672
I really can't understand you.

1028
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,502
I just want to be myself.

1029
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,467
If you're not yourself,

1030
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:14,214
then what are you?

1031
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:17,877
This is not the real me!

1032
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,252
I want to make bread.

1033
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,465
I want to be myself.

1034
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,252
This is so disgusting!

1035
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,422
This is the most disgusting thing

1036
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:31,135
I've ever had in my life.

1037
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,127
My Justin?

1038
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:38,880
What are you doing here?

1039
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,843
You've been stalking me!

1040
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:43,755
What's the smell?

1041
00:57:44,292 --> 00:57:45,589
I don't know either...

1042
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:56,460
You're really dumb, aren't you?

1043
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,172
You even burned it?

1044
00:57:58,958 --> 00:57:59,800
Besides,

1045
00:57:59,792 --> 00:58:01,089
this is Chinese pastry, right?

1046
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:03,336
Well, how would I know?

1047
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:14,085
Are you making it for us?

1048
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:15,209
Sure,

1049
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,377
I can't do cake

1050
00:58:17,542 --> 00:58:19,465
but I can make very good bread.

1051
00:58:19,917 --> 00:58:22,261
But can you really make it?

1052
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,334
Don't worry.

1053
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:26,051
I can make anything.

1054
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:29,552
First you put the flour in

1055
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,968
and add some yeast.

1056
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,252
Then pour some water in.

1057
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:40,925
You make the dough

1058
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,503
and wait until it's risen.

1059
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:55,588
Look!

1060
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:58,214
It has risen.

1061
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,877
I also put dried longan in it.

1062
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,172
Wow!

1063
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:09,257
Remember to squeeze the air out from the dough.

1064
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:11,843
So the bread will look prettier.

1065
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,423
Yeast and lactic acid bacteria

1066
00:59:17,417 --> 00:59:19,840
play an important role in bread making.

1067
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:25,260
They're just like lovers.

1068
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,218
They fall in love

1069
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:28,551
only at a certain temperature.

1070
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:36,710
Be delicious!

1071
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,296
Try it.

1072
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:41,589
Wow,

1073
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:43,677
they look so pretty.

1074
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,718
Wow, they smell so nice.

1075
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,253
I didn't expect you could make such good bread.

1076
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,298
I noticed that you looked so happy

1077
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:53,839
when you were making bread.

1078
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:56,052
I've never seen you so happy.

1079
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:57,129
Really?

1080
00:59:57,208 --> 00:59:57,925
Yeah.

1081
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:01,299
And you talked to the dough, right?

1082
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:04,334
Yes.

1083
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:06,335
My dad said

1084
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:07,960
the dough was a living thing.

1085
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,547
If we want people who eat the bread

1086
01:00:10,542 --> 01:00:11,759
feel our good will,

1087
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:13,255
we need to take care of the dough

1088
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,502
and talk to it.

1089
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:17,002
Wow, it's magic!

1090
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:19,380
Then...

1091
01:00:20,542 --> 01:00:22,340
what did you say to the dough?

1092
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,877
I said,

1093
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,585
"Be delicious!"

1094
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:34,842
Wow,

1095
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:36,881
it seems to have worked!

1096
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:44,125
Hey,

1097
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,046
thank you.

1098
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,218
What for?

1099
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:51,676
If you really want to thank me,

1100
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,628
make bread for me every day.

1101
01:00:55,292 --> 01:00:56,134
Sure,

1102
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:57,172
no problem!

1103
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:20,834
Prospectus (French bakery school)

1104
01:01:31,417 --> 01:01:32,794
Okay, everyone.

1105
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:34,385
Show us the dessert

1106
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,548
you made with your family.

1107
01:01:36,542 --> 01:01:38,215
Please introduce it to everyone.

1108
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:40,585
Yes.

1109
01:01:40,792 --> 01:01:43,261
This is the Chinese taro pastry my mom made.

1110
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,712
What? Not macaroon?

1111
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:51,007
This is the Chinese red bean pastry
my sister made.

1112
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,844
What?

1113
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:57,302
Where is the green tea and red bean cake?

1114
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:00,469
This is the Chinese rice cake my mom made.

1115
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:03,670
What? Chinese rice cake?

1116
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:11,792
This is the wine and dried longan bread
I brought.

1117
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:19,461
Wow, it's so delicious!

1118
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:14,172
Did you see the papers

1119
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:15,919
I put on your table yesterday?

1120
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:18,793
Yes.

1121
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,048
Since you love baking so much,

1122
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:30,794
go learn it properly.

1123
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,425
I'll make all the arrangements.

1124
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:39,219
Stop seeing the girl.

1125
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:57,630
I'm leaving.

1126
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:02,257
I'm going to learn baking...

1127
01:04:05,917 --> 01:04:08,261
...because I want to see your smile again,

1128
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:13,386
the very happy smile.

1129
01:04:15,917 --> 01:04:17,794
The smile on your face

1130
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:20,506
when you ate the bread I made for you.

1131
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:25,628
Thank you

1132
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:29,132
for encouraging me to pursue my dream.

1133
01:04:30,542 --> 01:04:32,340
Please have some belief in me.

1134
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:34,548
Please give me some more time.

1135
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:36,255
I'll try to be a better person

1136
01:04:37,667 --> 01:04:39,761
just for you.

1137
01:04:40,417 --> 01:04:43,136
It doesn't matter

1138
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:44,468
even if no one believes in you.

1139
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:46,256
It's enough as long as you believe in yourself.

1140
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:42,127
Matthew is so nasty!

1141
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:43,923
He took the crew back to Taipei

1142
01:05:43,917 --> 01:05:46,215
just to stop Justin seeing Dan!

1143
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:48,589
He's so nasty!

1144
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:50,210
But Justin is even nastier!

1145
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:52,130
He left without saying goodbye.

1146
01:05:52,458 --> 01:05:54,335
He just sent a text saying
he's leaving for France.

1147
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:56,468
After all, what is Dan to him?

1148
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,297
Mom,

1149
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,714
what should we do?

1150
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:07,753
Sis isn't being herself, right?

1151
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:10,881
I've never seen her like this.

1152
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:13,719
It's so worrying.

1153
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:19,255
Come,

1154
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,126
have it before it gets cold.

1155
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:22,344
There is soup too.

1156
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:25,756
Is it edible?

1157
01:06:30,542 --> 01:06:32,920
Eh? What's the smell?

1158
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:34,710
Dad!

1159
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:37,672
It's so nice to have you home!

1160
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:39,010
Sis is acting really weird.

1161
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:41,173
Only you can help her.

1162
01:06:41,292 --> 01:06:43,135
Do something, quick!

1163
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,751
What's wrong with you?

1164
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:20,626
What?

1165
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:27,509
You're serious?

1166
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:28,630
Of course!

1167
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:45,343
- Mom! -Darling!

1168
01:07:52,167 --> 01:07:53,214
Does it hurt?

1169
01:07:53,458 --> 01:07:54,459
No.

1170
01:07:55,583 --> 01:07:56,334
And you?

1171
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:58,217
No, no.

1172
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:03,877
It's killing me!

1173
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:05,544
Why did you hit so hard?

1174
01:08:05,542 --> 01:08:06,543
You did the same, didn't you?

1175
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:12,301
I heard from your mom that

1176
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:14,044
you're in love with a big star?

1177
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:17,044
Nonsense.

1178
01:08:17,042 --> 01:08:18,134
Don't listen to her.

1179
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:19,380
He's just a friend.

1180
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:20,967
Okay, okay,

1181
01:08:21,417 --> 01:08:22,509
if you say so.

1182
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,340
But if he's just a friend,

1183
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:27,552
how could he upset you so much?

1184
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:32,345
I gave you an opening,

1185
01:08:32,667 --> 01:08:34,715
but you missed the chance to attack.

1186
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:44,835
I just hate them leaving like that.

1187
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:47,423
Without even saying goodbye.

1188
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,720
I know nothing apart from martial arts.

1189
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:57,422
I understand it's painful,

1190
01:08:58,708 --> 01:09:01,382
but we, martial arts fighters,
must face the pain.

1191
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:04,173
We have to take up the challenge bravely.

1192
01:09:04,542 --> 01:09:07,512
So we won't let ourselves down and have regret.

1193
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:11,464
Dan,

1194
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:16,209
people come in and out of our lives.

1195
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:18,794
Just let it be.

1196
01:09:19,292 --> 01:09:21,386
He'll come back

1197
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:23,173
if he's meant to do so.

1198
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:25,797
No matter what happens,

1199
01:09:26,042 --> 01:09:30,218
your family will always be with you.

1200
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:38,002
Come on, you'll be fine.

1201
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,002
Why are you crying?

1202
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:43,631
Mom.

1203
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,673
MY good girl.

1204
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:50,335
What happened?

1205
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:53,341
You're the bravest girl.

1206
01:09:59,708 --> 01:10:01,426
You'll make Mommy sad too...

1207
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,423
Hey,

1208
01:10:10,417 --> 01:10:12,886
I finally finished the essay.

1209
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:16,469
They say it'll be published in the next issue.

1210
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:17,834
Yeah?

1211
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:18,379
I really look forward to it.

1212
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:19,467
You must show it to me.

1213
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:21,127
Of course.

1214
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:24,339
Dan.

1215
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:27,510
What is it?

1216
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,376
What the crap is it?

1217
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:29,422
It's so disgusting!

1218
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:33,176
Can you eat it?

1219
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:36,085
Damn!

1220
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,548
Bad Girls, let's go!

1221
01:10:40,292 --> 01:10:41,760
Hey, what are you doing?

1222
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:44,255
What?

1223
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:47,294
What on earth are you doing?

1224
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:50,086
You bully an old lady in the broad daylight?

1225
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:51,217
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

1226
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:52,050
Are you looking for trouble?

1227
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,251
Shame on you!

1228
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,251
Bored with life?

1229
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:06,800
What are you doing?

1230
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:10,172
Say "Sorry"-

1231
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:11,171
I'm sorry.

1232
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:12,755
Again!

1233
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:19,052
Sorry, it's my fault.

1234
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:19,668
Get off!

1235
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,842
Sorry.

1236
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:24,635
How dare you bully an old lady?

1237
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:26,130
It serves you right, you bad guy!

1238
01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:29,836
The summer has gone just like that.

1239
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:32,881
Dan seems to be herself again

1240
01:11:33,042 --> 01:11:34,885
and becomes even stronger.

1241
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,881
I hope one day I'll become someone like her

1242
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,709
I'll teach bad guys a lesson
and protect the whole world.

1243
01:11:46,917 --> 01:11:48,385
Instead of yeast,

1244
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:49,718
we use two other ingredients in the baking.

1245
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:52,837
Water and flour.

1246
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:53,959
Mix them and turn them into dough.

1247
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:57,633
Cover the dough with cloth

1248
01:11:57,625 --> 01:11:59,093
and leave it in 20 degree for 2 or 3 days.

1249
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:03,964
Some liquid will come out of it.

1250
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:06,837
It smells little bit like vinegar.

1251
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:08,551
But it's milder than vinegar.

1252
01:12:09,042 --> 01:12:09,884
Do you understand?

1253
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:10,717
Yes.

1254
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:26,335
He says he's gone to learn baking in France?

1255
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:28,923
I bet he's more likely to go after the girls.

1256
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:34,969
According to my essay,

1257
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:36,835
love...

1258
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:39,256
...is like "the cocktail in our brain".

1259
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:41,673
It's made of dopamine,

1260
01:12:41,667 --> 01:12:43,795
phenethylamine and oxytocin.

1261
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:46,210
After a while

1262
01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:48,920
people will become resistant
to these substances

1263
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,593
SO...

1264
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:52,881
...the feelings of love disappear.

1265
01:12:53,792 --> 01:12:55,214
Therefore...

1266
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:57,210
true love...

1267
01:12:57,208 --> 01:12:59,006
...never exists!

1268
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,296
Well,

1269
01:13:01,292 --> 01:13:04,011
men are never faithful,

1270
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,547
are they?

1271
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,342
Huang Dan-Chi,

1272
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:19,505
no matter how you stop me,

1273
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,843
I still want to tell you

1274
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:22,710
that I like...

1275
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,717
Huang Dan-Chi!

1276
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,924
I like you!

1277
01:14:20,917 --> 01:14:22,214
Dumb,

1278
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:24,459
It's been a while.

1279
01:14:24,958 --> 01:14:25,959
How are you doing?

1280
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:35,878
You come and go as you please.

1281
01:14:37,292 --> 01:14:38,544
Who do you think you are?

1282
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:43,005
Tell you what?

1283
01:14:43,917 --> 01:14:45,214
No matter how much I love bread,

1284
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,673
I'll never eat the bread you make.

1285
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:59,423
In order to realize my dream,

1286
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,844
I spent many months learning baking in France.

1287
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:05,965
Just because I want to make bread for you.

1288
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,127
Just because...

1289
01:15:11,125 --> 01:15:12,251
...I want to see your happy smile.

1290
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:24,130
These are for you.

1291
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:35,626
Why did you give me flowers?

1292
01:15:37,958 --> 01:15:39,005
They're not edible!

1293
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:41,301
You're such a hypocrite.

1294
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,172
You thought the roses

1295
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:44,760
would do the trick?

1296
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,083
Dan, come have tea.

1297
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:45,676
Okay.

1298
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:02,718
Dan, I really like you.

1299
01:18:02,708 --> 01:18:04,881
I'm serious.

1300
01:18:28,042 --> 01:18:32,047
Hey, why has Mi been knitting the scarf?

1301
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,385
Well, you don't understand it.

1302
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:37,799
She's been knitting the scarf
for more than ten years.

1303
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:40,551
She's Waiting for the man

1304
01:18:40,542 --> 01:18:42,419
who truly appreciates her.

1305
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:44,585
Oh, I see...

1306
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:55,880
Where is Dan?

1307
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,672
Dan?

1308
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:01,881
It's the special screening today.

1309
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:04,422
She didn't go to see Justin at the backstage,

1310
01:19:04,417 --> 01:19:05,669
did she?

1311
01:19:06,167 --> 01:19:07,339
Jusfin?

1312
01:19:09,167 --> 01:19:10,794
Don't let me see him.

1313
01:19:10,792 --> 01:19:13,011
Or I'll beat him up, even he's a star.

1314
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:16,296
Hey,

1315
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:18,005
don't behave like him.

1316
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:20,335
Of course I won't!

1317
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:31,880
Ladies and gentlemen,

1318
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:32,751
thank you for waiting.

1319
01:19:33,042 --> 01:19:35,170
Thank you so much

1320
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:38,296
for coming to the special screening.

1321
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:39,710
Before the film starts,

1322
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:41,927
let's welcome our young and ambitious

1323
01:19:41,917 --> 01:19:45,046
township supervisor,

1324
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:45,508
Mr. Hsieh

1325
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,752
to say a few words.

1326
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,377
Please welcome Mr. Hsieh.

1327
01:19:54,292 --> 01:19:55,509
Ladies and gentlemen,

1328
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,252
thank you so much for coming to see the film,

1329
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:58,752
Good Day, My love,

1330
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:00,673
sponsored by "18 Copper Men".

1331
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:02,301
We feel honored

1332
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:04,420
that the film was shot in our town.

1333
01:20:04,708 --> 01:20:06,301
My son, "Douzai",

1334
01:20:06,292 --> 01:20:08,044
has a cameo role in this film.

1335
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:10,585
Come on, Douzai,

1336
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:13,336
introduce the background

1337
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:14,630
and the character you played to the audience

1338
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:15,467
Daddy,

1339
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:16,675
I'm the background!

1340
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:19,585
Ah, it's alright.

1341
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:21,669
It is our honor that we've made

1342
01:20:21,792 --> 01:20:23,135
our contribution

1343
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:24,676
to the Taiwanese cinema

1344
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,468
and show people the beauty of our hometown.

1345
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:27,926
Do you all agree?

1346
01:20:27,917 --> 01:20:29,089
Yes, I do!

1347
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,217
Oh, I got it. Got it.

1348
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:34,175
Let's just watch the film.

1349
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:35,376
Before that

1350
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:37,173
my son and I would like to sing

1351
01:20:37,167 --> 01:20:39,420
a popular Taiwanese song called

1352
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:41,761
"Keep Turning! Colorful Neon Lights!"

1353
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:44,629
Come on, keyboard player, music on!

1354
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:47,708
Keep turning! Colorful neon lights!

1355
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:50,712
You make me understand life!

1356
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:57,835
Sis, what are you doing?

1357
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:02,505
Nothing.

1358
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:03,626
Leave me alone!

1359
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,718
You're not going to see your movie?

1360
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:07,172
No, I'm not.

1361
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:09,967
I don't want to see it!

1362
01:21:09,958 --> 01:21:10,550
Get out.

1363
01:21:10,542 --> 01:21:11,919
Get out!

1364
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:17,092
Fancy a bite?

1365
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:18,175
It's really good.

1366
01:21:37,708 --> 01:21:38,925
Where did you get the bread from?

1367
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:41,801
From the new bakery.

1368
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:51,671
Hello, Dumb!

1369
01:22:52,125 --> 01:22:53,377
Who is Dumb?

1370
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:03,717
What are you doing here?

1371
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:09,876
This...

1372
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,547
How is it?

1373
01:23:27,792 --> 01:23:29,089
Is it good?

1374
01:23:32,958 --> 01:23:34,301
I made it for you.

1375
01:23:38,292 --> 01:23:39,965
It took me ages

1376
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:41,756
to find edible roses.

1377
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,048
Then I put them in this "Lovers' Rose Bread".

1378
01:23:45,417 --> 01:23:47,215
I work so hard just to

1379
01:23:48,292 --> 01:23:50,386
express my feelings for you

1380
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:53,758
through bread.

1381
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,628
You gave me the courage to

1382
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:05,128
do things I enjoy.

1383
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:07,093
To find my true self.

1384
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:11,051
I want to make you happy and

1385
01:24:11,667 --> 01:24:15,342
this becomes the goal in my life.

1386
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:21,176
Thank you.

1387
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:31,969
Then... do you like me?

1388
01:24:36,167 --> 01:24:37,544
Yes, very much!

1389
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:51,469
I forgot who said it.

1390
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,344
"Life is like bread."

1391
01:24:54,542 --> 01:24:58,297
"Only when you eat it
will you know if it's good."

1392
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:34,299
Wow, this girl is so agile!

1393
01:25:34,292 --> 01:25:37,466
Good! This girl will definitely be a star!

1394
01:25:53,917 --> 01:25:54,292
Bravo!

1395
01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:56,090
Just kiss her!

1396
01:26:08,917 --> 01:26:10,089
So...

1397
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:12,336
this is how my first love affair ended.

1398
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:15,712
But Dan's first love affair
is just about to begin.

1399
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:42,836
Don't be fooled. The story hasn't ended yet...

1400
01:26:44,042 --> 01:26:45,510
Freeze!

1401
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,592
Stop running!

1402
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,252
Freeze!

1403
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:15,716
Cut!

1404
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:17,051
Okay!

1405
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:18,968
Thank you!

1406
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:20,756
Hey, you, where did you come from?

1407
01:27:22,042 --> 01:27:23,134
You can't fight properly.

1408
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:24,593
You can't afford the compensation

1409
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:25,630
if you hurt Dan.

1410
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:27,460
I'm professional!

1411
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:28,710
I feel it was okay.

1412
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:29,960
Do you have any problem?

1413
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,126
You've got such an attitude, eh?

1414
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:33,002
You wouldn't apologize, would you?

1415
01:27:33,292 --> 01:27:34,669
Do some homework, okay?

1416
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:35,634
Take him away.

1417
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:36,751
I haven't finished yet.

1418
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:37,501
Mi, thank you.

1419
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,046
Well done.

1420
01:27:38,042 --> 01:27:39,294
What do you think? Was I good?

1421
01:27:39,417 --> 01:27:40,009
Very good.

1422
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,627
Better than Lara Croft!

1423
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:44,130
Hey, don't you feel too hot?

1424
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:45,959
This is love.

1425
01:27:45,958 --> 01:27:46,675
Ah?

1426
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:49,050
Wow!

1427
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:51,209
I'm so hungry!

1428
01:27:51,417 --> 01:27:51,963
Hungry?

1429
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:52,800
Stop eating.

1430
01:27:52,792 --> 01:27:53,463
You're getting fat!

1431
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:54,254
No way!

1432
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:55,217
Hey, Dumb!

1433
01:27:56,292 --> 01:27:57,965
It's Dan!

1434
01:27:59,625 --> 01:28:01,377
Wow, bread!

1435
01:28:01,375 --> 01:28:02,171
Thank you.

1436
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:04,551
Come on, actors, get ready.

1437
01:28:05,667 --> 01:28:06,418
I'll keep it for you.

1438
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:09,168
Thank you.

1439
01:28:09,167 --> 01:28:09,963
Hey, Dan.

1440
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:11,505
Be careful.

1441
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,296
Good luck!
