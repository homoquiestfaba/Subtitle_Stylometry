1
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:34,761
Hello!?

2
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:37,729
- Hello?
- Daniel!?

3
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:47,185
How did you folks get here?

4
00:00:52,808 --> 00:00:54,581
Where you from?

5
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:58,621
- Brooklyn Heights.
- Sarah!

6
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:04,534
- Where is everybody?
- How long has it been?

7
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:09,637
You come into contact
with anyone else from..

8
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:11,161
Brooklyn Heights?

9
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:23,252
Yeah, we're gonna need a couple of guys
up there, if that makes any sense?

10
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:26,868
You stay put.

11
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,244
8 million New Yorkers disseminated
in three short weeks.

12
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:26,509
People will do crazy things when
they're backed into a corner.

13
00:02:26,807 --> 00:02:29,034
Black Friday is when it all began.

14
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:33,469
The origin of this disease
is still unconfirmed.

15
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:35,381
But, there are many
theories speculated

16
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,579
that it could be the result of a
well orchestrated terrorist attack.

17
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:42,493
By the time Washington had the first
report of a small pox outbreak,

18
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:43,662
it was too late.

19
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,227
I tried to get my wife and
daughter out of New York.

20
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:49,788
Too bad, the military had
the city locked up tight.

21
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:54,461
I tried my best to keep my family safe.

22
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:56,547
Repeat control of the city...

23
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:59,750
we have received word now that,
Shanghai, Hong Kong and London...

24
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,258
are just the few of the other locations
where this outbreak has been reported.

25
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:08,919
We have just got warning that we've lost
comms with the entire New York city.

26
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,013
If it's anything, now is
the time, Mr. President.

27
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,763
Sarah thinks that it is an adventure.

28
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:20,648
She has always been an optimistic kid.

29
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:25,443
I'm leaving soon.

30
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,591
I haven't told 'em yet.

31
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:30,231
This is the hardest part.

32
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:34,301
Dad!? Dad!?

33
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:36,748
What happened with the TV?

34
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:40,575
Trisha's first reaction is usually panic.

35
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:43,176
Still I can count on her
when thing's get tough.

36
00:03:43,185 --> 00:03:45,412
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

37
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:50,505
Look! There is a division that is activated
during a catastrophic emergency.

38
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:54,138
A safety switch, when more of less fails.

39
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:56,440
I am part of that division.

40
00:03:57,785 --> 00:04:01,464
Our objective is simple:
Restore law and order.

41
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:14,300
This is Daryl, override! All copy?
Can you hear me?

42
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,778
John here.

43
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:19,281
Get your stash locations quick.
Then rendezvous on me.

44
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:42,429
All units please be advised,

45
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:44,990
I'm getting reports of some heavy
looting in the vicinity here.

46
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:46,794
- Keep those eyes peeled.
- Copy that!

47
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:50,440
C'mon unlock the
door, I won't bite.

48
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,075
911, what is your emergency?

49
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:54,377
Several men just smashed the
windows downstairs.

50
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,642
I can... I can hear them.
Ahh!

51
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:03,352
Infected money.

52
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,040
Black Friday, there the first supply.
Take out the American public...

53
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,304
but who is responsible?

54
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,149
Three words: Government, Sleeper, Agents.

55
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:18,837
- And who are these sleeper agents?
- Well It could be anyone.

56
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:23,103
It could be you.
It could be me.

57
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:25,432
- It could even be Mia.
- Even!?

58
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:26,845
Yes, even.

59
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,970
Well, I'm gonna go get you
guys that pizza. Okay?

60
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:32,759
Love you, babe.

61
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:35,650
Hey, not too crispy, right?

62
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:40,162
Look Saj,

63
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:42,024
I think you been inside
a little too long,

64
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,230
and it's starting to mess
with your head now, Bro.

65
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:48,017
Oh yeah? Maybe Mr Jackson
could convince you.

66
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:52,273
A sample.

67
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:57,119
A bill infected with the virus.

68
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,600
Woo! What the hell dude?

69
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:01,533
- You gotta infect us all.
- Relax!

70
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:02,989
It's hygienically sealed.

71
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:05,205
Hygienically sealed?
It's a sandwich bag.

72
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:07,830
No, no! Two sandwich bags.

73
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,646
Judging by your reaction,
you believe me.

74
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:13,377
I gotta hand it to you, Saj.

75
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:16,275
I have no idea how you
figured this all out.

76
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:19,244
But it's obvious...

77
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:23,196
you know way too much now.

78
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:26,125
Dude! What the hell!?

79
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,625
Ow! Dude that's a costly replica!
Totally costs hundreds!

80
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:36,947
- Did you hear that?
- What?

81
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:38,115
What are you doing?

82
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,814
Do not open that.
They can smell the pizza.

83
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,290
I thought I heard the looters outside.

84
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,281
It's an freaking apocalypse!
Of course there are looters outside!

85
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,946
Hey Saj! You know,

86
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:53,101
we love having you here and I know it's the
apocalypse out there and everything but...

87
00:07:53,102 --> 00:07:55,407
how long were you
planning on staying?

88
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,710
Sorry, the truth capped
your ass so hard, Mia.

89
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:01,401
But when a man comes bursting through those
doors, you be glad, Saj is on your side.

90
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:04,401
Oh God!

91
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:08,401
Oh my God!

92
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:12,766
Saj, it's... it's time.

93
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:14,814
Um, time for what?

94
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:19,819
- Pizza!
- Yeah!

95
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:23,519
Yeah!

96
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:33,625
- No, no, no!
- It's fake! It's fake!

97
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:34,152
This is Daryl, up and running.
All copy?

98
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:36,008
- This is Mia.
- Everett here.

99
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:38,164
Yeah I was hoping to get
the call a little sooner.

100
00:09:38,263 --> 00:09:39,669
No way!

101
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:48,479
Get to your stash locations quick
then rendezvous on me...

102
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,244
- Copy that! Copy that!
- Copy! I'm on my way.

103
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,956
Hand me the bag.

104
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,232
The other bag.

105
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:10,725
You coming' back, right babe?

106
00:10:13,748 --> 00:10:15,389
That was hot!

107
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,542
I've lost all contact
with the JTF checkpoint.

108
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,534
Ah..anyone have
confirmation on this?

109
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:03,374
Where the storm come from?

110
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:05,427
Can't see anything
out here, let's go!

111
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:08,255
Hey? Hey?

112
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,462
- Everett!
- Michael!?

113
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:15,335
What are you doing here?

114
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:17,441
Was about to ask you the same question.

115
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:21,898
If anyone wants supplies.
Keeping an eye on a few people.

116
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,577
Last thing you need to be
worried about is work.

117
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:28,924
It could be dangerous around here.
You by yourself?

118
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
Will be.

119
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:38,252
Looking for something in particular?

120
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:43,372
Yeah... morphine.

121
00:12:45,258 --> 00:12:49,156
She's in lotta pain.
I just wanna make it easy on her.

122
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:54,181
Alright! Let me see what I can find.

123
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:04,579
Hey!?

124
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:06,409
Hey?

125
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,764
Here.

126
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,627
Stop, c'mon!

127
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,455
Okay! okay!

128
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:29,493
Stop! Just give me the bag.

129
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:32,087
Stop! No, no!

130
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:58,311
Hey! Hey! Stop!

131
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:11,464
Hey!

132
00:15:11,564 --> 00:15:12,868
Don't hurt her!

133
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:19,922
Mother!?

134
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:33,837
Sorry. Bad kids! Trouble.

135
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:44,040
Sorry! Your bag, here.

136
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:05,126
Here! Antibiotics.

137
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:15,095
Food.

138
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:33,902
This is Daryl, up and running.
All copy?

139
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,259
- This is Mia.
- Everett here.

140
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:37,244
Yeah I was hoping to get
the call a little sooner.

141
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,807
Get to your stash locations
quick then rendezvous on me...

142
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:41,411
- Copy that! Copy that!
- I'm on my way.

143
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:45,611
- Thank you.
- Next time, just ask!

144
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:55,265
Yeah, dispatch we got fires popping up
all over the place. You guy's see this?

145
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:58,136
We got two garbage trucks
just pulled up outside.

146
00:16:58,137 --> 00:16:59,510
What the hell is sanitation doing here?

147
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,646
- What the hell!?
- Run! run! run!

148
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:09,041
Matches anyone?

149
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:14,798
You need water, I need fire.

150
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,573
This is Daryl, up and running.
All copy?

151
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:05,454
- This is Mia.
- Everett here.

152
00:18:05,463 --> 00:18:07,580
Yeah I was hoping to get
the call a little sooner.

153
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:09,906
Get to your stash locations quick...
then rendezvous on me.

154
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:11,168
- Copy that!
- Copy that!

155
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,360
Copy that.

156
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,375
No guys! Wait!

157
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,765
Please, wait.

158
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:50,045
Wait! Please, no!
Please!

159
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,887
Dad! dad!

160
00:23:26,191 --> 00:23:27,118
It's John.

161
00:23:27,127 --> 00:23:30,832
We are at the rendezvous point.
Where are you?

162
00:23:31,723 --> 00:23:35,504
John here. Hold tight.
I'm five minutes out.

163
00:23:53,176 --> 00:23:55,296
We are picking' up a lotta chatter,
East of Manhattan.

164
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:58,052
It's a JTF stronghold supply drop!

165
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:01,858
Everett! See if you can
tap into the wait pool for us.

166
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:03,389
Roger that.

167
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:07,887
OK! So what's our move?

168
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:36,676
- Everett, on over watch.
- Copy.

169
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,402
Scanning.

170
00:24:57,739 --> 00:25:00,489
- Conserve ammo.
- Copy.

171
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:03,365
Holding.

172
00:25:06,644 --> 00:25:08,888
On me...

173
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,567
Three, two...

174
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:34,582
Go! Go! Go! Kill them!
Kill them! Let's go.

175
00:26:22,362 --> 00:26:24,449
Mia rapid fire.

176
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,280
Move!

177
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,128
Keep cover! Keep your heads down!

178
