1
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,828
We Have An 18-Year-Old Male

2
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,331
With Gunshot Wounds
To The Leg And Shoulder.

3
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,467
One, Two, Three.

4
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,843
Yep. He's On Something.

5
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:21,647
Jason.
I Need To Talk To Jason.

6
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:25,684
Soon. Just Not Now.

7
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,688
Get Her Into Pre-Op.

8
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,794
How Did You Get In?

9
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,496
I...I Heard The Gunshots,

10
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:40,532
And I Rushed To The Back Door.

11
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,838
What'd You Do To Jason?

12
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,306
Huh?

13
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:48,707
Can I See A Doctor?

14
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,576
Baby, The Police Are Outside.

15
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,378
And If You're Up To It,
They Want To Talk To You.

16
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,847
I'll Take Care Of Ashley,
Mr. Lane.

17
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:56,582
Thank You, Brother.

18
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,296
So...

19
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,365
How Did You End Up

20
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,635
At Your Brother's Girlfriend's
House Last Night?

21
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,137
We Were Working On...

22
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,638
Christmas Costumes
For My Play.

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,142
Where'd You Get The Money
We Found In Your Possession?

24
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,244
We Were Raising That Money

25
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:26,478
At The Garage Sale Yesterday.

26
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,450
See, This Past Fall,
Things Had Gotten Pretty Bad...

27
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:33,652
At School,

28
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,487
At Home.

29
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,823
Man: This Year's Production,

30
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,559
<I>Holiday Cheer,
Has Been Penned</I>

31
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,828
By Yours Truly.

32
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,733
All Right,
So When I Call Your Name,

33
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:50,602
Just Come Up To The Stage
And State The Part

34
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,671
You'll Be Reading.

35
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,807
Uh, Monica Tishauer.

36
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,816
I'll Be Reading For Betty,

37
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:05,951
The Garbage Girl.

38
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:10,789
Just Look At What
I Found In My Garbage Truck.

39
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,225
I'll Have The Best-Decorated

40
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,561
House In Town.

41
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,866
This Is Garbage.

42
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,403
Man: Ashley Lane?

43
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,540
Ashley Lane?

44
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,644
People,
Time Is Of The Essence.

45
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:36,682
Last Call For Ashley Lane.

46
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,620
Right.

47
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,623
Karen Snow?

48
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,943
Idiot.

49
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:05,777
How Will You Know

50
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:06,979
If You Will Ever Do Anything

51
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:09,615
If You Can
Never Do Anything?

52
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,656
How'd It Go?

53
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:18,857
It Went.

54
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,761
I Decided That
I Didn't Have Time. So...

55
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:23,962
Should At Least Try.

56
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,797
Yeah? You Didn't.

57
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,499
It's Gonna Be Stupid Anyway.

58
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,368
Oh, But Ms. Lane,

59
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,670
You'd Be Missing Out
On Such A Wonderful

60
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,572
High School Experience.

61
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,475
Nicki, Drop Dead.

62
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,773
Forgot To Pick Up Jason.
Ah.

63
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,342
He's Been Waiting
A Half An Hour.

64
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:14,579
Well, He's 17.
He'll Get Over It.

65
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:18,650
Would It Bother You So Much
If It Was Ashley I Forgot?

66
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,319
Forget About It.
I'm Going.

67
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,453
I'm Going.

68
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,588
Thank You, Bill.

69
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,896
How About Let's Just Have An
Early Dinner Tonight, Huh, Baby?

70
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:31,963
Uh, Tonight's No Good.

71
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,734
I Already Made Plans
With Phyllis And Claire.

72
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,536
Maybe Next Time.

73
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,106
Okey-Dokey.

74
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,458
I Know...

75
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:03,962
Drive You Home?

76
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,898
No, It's Okay, Mr. Lane.
I Gotta Meet Someone.

77
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,102
But, Uh, Catch Y'all Later.

78
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,613
Fasten Your Seatbelt.

79
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:25,550
It Wasn't Me.
It Was Nicki.
Mm-Hmm.

80
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,027
I Think Your Mother--

81
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,597
You Mean Your Wife?

82
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,634
You've Got To Stop
Hanging Out With Nicole.

83
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,508
When We Get Home,

84
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,544
I Want You
To Put Those Clothes
In The Laundry.

85
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,713
They Smell Like Smoke.

86
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,417
I Saw That.

87
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,869
Geez!

88
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,204
Who Reeks In Here?

89
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:22,841
This Must Be You,
Ashtray Lane, Right?

90
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:27,546
So Jason, How Was Practice?

91
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,815
Brutal.

92
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,616
Captain Hit The Hurdle
Full-On.

93
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,452
He's Probably
Out For The Season.

94
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:37,489
But Hopefully I Get My Shot
At Being Captain Now.

95
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,157
Really?

96
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,159
It Could Happen.
Right?

97
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,762
I Mean, Who Else
Would Coach Pick, Anyway?

98
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:47,866
Someone With Better Grades.

99
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:09,988
Where's Mom?

100
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,957
At Some Committee Thing.

101
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,624
Right.

102
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,192
Yo. Think Fast, Brainless.

103
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,533
Hey, Where You Going?

104
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:21,967
Uh...

105
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:25,670
Just Gonna Go Meet Up
And Study With Angel Tonight.

106
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,805
Look, Uh...

107
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,807
If I Don't Get Off Probation
This Semester,

108
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:29,741
Then I Can't Run Track.

109
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:33,578
And We Both Know
How Disappointed That
Would Make Mom, Right?

110
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,180
Yeah. Sorry.

111
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,282
Where're Your Books?

112
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,827
I'm Gonna
Go Get Some Chicken.

113
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,030
Anybody...

114
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,032
Wanna Come?

115
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,635
Nicki, Big Surprise...

116
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:57,736
Sharon Is Out.


117
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,105
And All I Have To Do
Is Homework And Laundry.

118
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,606
Dad's Picking Up Dinner.

119
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,608
So You're Alone?

120
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,076
Cain's Club Time.

121
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,177
Uh, I Don't--

122
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,647
He's Gonna Be Back.

123
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:09,214
So?

124
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,283
Just Leave Him A Note.

125
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,819
Okay, Meet Me In 15.

126
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,250
Hey, There.

127
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,284
Hey.

128
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,786
What's Your Name?

129
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,121
They All Go Off
And Leave You?

130
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:50,956
Willy, Huh?

131
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,028
Thank You Very Much.

132
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,798
We Just Met.

133
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,770
Wanna Come Out And Play?

134
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,138
Huh?

135
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,873
Come On.

136
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:19,751
Billy.

137
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,020
Come On.

138
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,396
You...

139
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,798
You Really Stink.

140
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,134
We Have To Work On That.

141
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,343
Nice.

142
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,082
I've Got To Go.

143
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,752
But I'll Be Back.

144
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,055
See You Later.

145
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,825
So This Beats
Doing Laundry, Huh?

146
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,028
I Mean, Just A Little?

147
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,131
I Can't Find My Cigarettes.

148
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,002
You And Your Dad
Not So Disney These Days.

149
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,070
Sharon And Me...

150
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:15,707
Like A Total Train Wreck.

151
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,813
You Got A Light?

152
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,684
Man:
Have We Met Before?

153
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,721
Trust Me...
If We Had, You'd Remember.

154
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,089
Dance?

155
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,351
Boy: Hey, Jason!

156
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,368
First-Timers.

157
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,804
Hey. Keep It Down.

158
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,108
I Got Money.

159
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,142
Um...

160
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,344
I Was Just Going
Down To Angel's.

161
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,046
You Could Drop Me Off There.

162
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,982
I Am...

163
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,218
Superman.

164
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,886
I Can Do Anything.

165
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,821
Man, You--
You Blew Me Away

166
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,223
At Practice Today.

167
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,357
You Think Maybe, Uh...

168
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,893
You Could Teach Me
To Do Distance?

169
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,331
I'm Not
A Miracle Worker, Baby.

170
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,533
Just Superman.

171
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,201
Go Ahead, Jazz.

172
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,836
I'll Advance You...

173
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,238
Again.

174
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,475
Hey, Hey, Hey.


175
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,778
That's--That's Mine.

176
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,013
Rich Boy's Good For It.

177
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,450
Nobody Gets Deep Into Me.

178
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,299
I Still Owe You?

179
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:25,403
You Jocks Aren't Very Good
With Numbers, Are You?

180
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,304
$120.

181
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,940
What?! I-I Just
Gave You A Hundred.

182
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,309
You Haven't Give Me Jack.

183
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,946
Your Parties Are Never
Gonna Be On Me.

184
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,015
I'll Get It To You, G.

185
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,817
Tomorrow, Jazz.

186
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,451
And Forget About Angel.

187
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:43,087
She Doesn't Own You.

188
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,440
Hello?

189
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,249
Wait A Minute.

190
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:14,953
This Isn't--

191
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:17,889
This Isn't The Washroom.

192
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,632
Hello?

193
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:33,471
You Know, This Isn't Exactly
The Best Neighborhood
To Be Passing Out In.

194
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,241
Where's Your Date?

195
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:40,912
I'm Not Allowed To Date.

196
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:45,083
I Am A Princess.


197
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,318
Shh.

198
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,220
Shh.

199
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,158
Oh...

200
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,673
All Right,
Let's Get You Home.

201
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,589
What...Great...Hair.

202
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,605
Whoo.

203
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,942
Yay.

204
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,721
Well, Princess,
Where Do You Live?

205
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,524
At Home.

206
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,264
Would You Like To Kiss Me?

207
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,734
Definitely Not.


208
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,003
Why Not?

209
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,471
Am I Ugly?

210
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,639

No.

211
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,308
Your Breath Stinks.

212
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,210
I Like You, Too.

213
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,145
Look, I've Got To Be At Work
Early Tomorrow,

214
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:25,016
And If You Want A Ride Home,
Just Tell Me Where You Live.

215
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,719
Otherwise, Out Of The Van.

216
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:33,558
5...3...3...

217
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,028
Parkwood Drive.

218
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,198
You Know...

219
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,001
You're Not Very Nice.

220
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,635
<I>I Am Not</I>

221
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:48,072
Going To Dance With You.

222
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,275
Hey, Baby.

223
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,276
Sharon: Hey.

224
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,644
How Was Dinner?

225
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:56,581
Didn't Go Too Well.

226
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,251
I Missed You.

227
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,686
Did You Have A Good Time?

228
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,489
We Were Trying To Motivate
The Denby Company

229
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,759
To Conform
To Green Standards.
Mm-Hmm.

230
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,395
I Have Been Working,

231
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,230
And I Am Tired.

232
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,564
I'm Green.

233
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,400
Did You Feed That Dog?

234
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,168
Ah...

235
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,369
I Told Jason To Do It.

236
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,438
The Dog Is Not Jason's
Little Brother.

237
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,407
And It's Not Gonna Make Up
For The Fact

238
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:25,576
That We Don't
Have A Child Together.

239
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:28,746
Wow.

240
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,259
What Are You Doing?

241
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:46,397
Bill: I Thought You Were
In Your Room Not Feeling Well.

242
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,165
I Am Not.

243
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,566
Sharon:
Where Have You Been?

244
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,600
And What Are You Wearing?!

245
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,203
That's Too Many Questions.

246
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:55,440
I Only Do One
At A Time, Okay?

247
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,408
It Is Not Okay.

248
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,277
Are You Drunk?

249
00:17:59,279 --> 00:17:59,844
You Been Drinking?

250
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,145
Oh, Give It
A Rest, Sharon.

251
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,513
I Seem To Remember You
Getting Hammered

252
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,482
A Time Or Two
When You Were Younger.

253
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,784
Bill: Come Here, Baby.

254
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:07,652
Okay, Daddy.

255
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,087
Put Your Hand Around Daddy.

256
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,455
Oh...
Real Neat.

257
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,123
I Love You.
I Know.

258
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,760
Can I Have Some
Cookies And Milk?

259
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,833
You Know You're
Better Than This.

260
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,471
I Wish I Had A Real Mom.

261
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:48,526
You Remind Me So Much
Of Amanda.

262
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,896
My Little Princess.

263
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,268
Sharon Hates Me.

264
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,204
Oh, No She Doesn't.

265
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,874
She Does Not Hate You.

266
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,242
She Just Gets Disappointed

267
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,645
When You Do Things
Like Tonight.

268
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,682
I'm Disappointed, Too.

269
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,186
But I Still Love You.

270
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,261
Good Night, Princess.

271
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:28,566
Why Do You
Disappoint Sharon, Daddy?

272
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:20,551
Whoa.

273
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,754
Who Beat You Up Last Night?


274
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,425

You Look Like Trash.

275
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,228
No Response?

276
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,497
Okay. Cool.


277
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,635
Oh, Yeah. Here You Go.

278
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,537
Want Some Breakfast?

279
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,505
You Can Have As Much
As You Want.

280
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,407
I Made Enough For Everybody.

281
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,444

What?

282
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,851
Okay.

283
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,419
More For Me.

284
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,666
I Actually Feel Better.

285
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:09,700
I Bet You Do.

286
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,936
Just Wanna Die Now.

287
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,905
Well, Here's A Little
Trick I Learned.

288
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,009
Peppermint Schnapps.

289
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:19,977
Drink Some Of This.

290
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,680
You'll Feel Better.
Come On.

291
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,620
Ooh. Oh, That's Good.

292
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,527
I Owe You.

293
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,629
Ah, Actually,

294
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,299
Funny That You Say That.

295
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:41,966
I, Uh...

296
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,368
Could Use Some Money
Right Now.

297
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,903
Hmm.
Hmm.

298
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:49,473
You And Everybody Else.

299
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:52,977
Y--What?

300
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,712
What Am I Supposed
To Do With $5?

301
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:58,015
I Can't--
Sharon: Good Morning.

302
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:58,616
Jay,

303
00:21:58,618 --> 00:21:59,817
Haven't Seen You
In A While.

304
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,452
<I>What's Been
Keeping You Busy?</I>

305
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,554
That Was Your Fault
Last Night, Mom.

306
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,955
What Are You Talking About?

307
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:07,425
While You Were At Your
Meeting Thing,

308
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:10,027
I Was Hittin' The Books.

309
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,763
All Right, Um,

310
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:13,698
I Happen To Be Free Tonight

311
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,566
If You Wanna Go Grab Dinner
Or Something,

312
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:16,667
Just The Two Of Us.
You're On.

313
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,603
I'll Pick You Up
After Practice.
All Right.

314
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:20,738
Bye, Baby.

315
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,940
Feel Better.

316
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,988
Sharon.

317
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,659
About Last Night...

318
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:42,860
I'm Sorry.

319
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:43,694
I Guess I Just...

320
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,664
Makin' A Play
For Your Father's Attention?

321
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,466
Again?

322
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
I'm Just Trying To--

323
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,769
Well I'm Trying
To Keep Peace

324
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:52,837
For Your Father's Sake.

325
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,972
Can't You At Least Do That?

326
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:57,842
Keep Peace?
Mm-Hmm.

327
00:22:58,777 --> 00:22:59,977
Yeah.

328
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,779
Yeah, I Can--
I Can Do That.

329
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:04,515
Good.


330
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,800
"Good Morning, Dad."

331
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,034
Hello, Kids.

332
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,874
"I'll Make You
Coffee, Dad."

333
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,776
Thank You, Honey.

334
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,149
"I'll Do The Dishes, Dad."

335
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:40,484
Thank You, Jason.

336
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,893
Make It Strong, Bill.

337
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:51,128
Make It Strong.

338
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,711
What Is That?

339
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,947
Here You Go.
Thank You, Baby.

340
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:10,981
You're Welcome.

341
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:11,949
Sharon?
Yeah.

342
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,919
Could We Agree
To Cut Down On Some Things?

343
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,120
I'm Not Spending
Anything Extra.

344
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,490
No, But Your Lunches
And Your Dinners
With Your Friends

345
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:20,057
Really Add Up.

346
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,159
Maybe If You Did Something
With A Future.?

347
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,695
Lane Publishing
Was Daddy's Baby.

348
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,130
But Not Ours.

349
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,200
Your Lobbying Job
Pays Practically Nothing.

350
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:32,069
Well, At Least I'm
Contributing To Society.

351
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:36,574
I'd Like You To Contribute
More To Our Finances.

352
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,710
This House Is Worth
Less Than Half

353
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:40,578
Of What We Paid For It.

354
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,246
Were Are Serious
Underwater, Baby.

355
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:45,149
You're Not Thinking
Of Selling It, Are You?

356
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:45,850
We Can't.

357
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:48,919
We Don't Have Enough Equity
To Pay Off The Mortgage.

358
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,055
I'll Get It.

359
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:52,857
I Was On My Way Out,
Anyway.

360
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,925
Have A Nice Day.

361
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,761
Hi, There.
I Noticed You Might

362
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:00,631
Need Some Maintenance
Work Done.

363
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,234
Bill!

364
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:08,706
Hi.

365
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,242
Uh, What Can I Do For You?

366
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:12,243
I Hope I Can Help You.

367
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:14,745
I Just Finished Several Jobs
For You Neighbors.

368
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:17,214
Uh, The Alexanders,
Proudfoots,

369
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:18,015
And Mr. Wilson.

370
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,519
They Can All Tell You
About My Work.
Mmm.

371
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,120
Thanks, But I Really--

372
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:24,989
If I May. Uh...

373
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,257
Some Areas--

374
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,694
Need Serious Repair.

375
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:32,963
I Know. Believe Me.

376
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:34,598
Uh, Look, Thanks,
But I Can't--

377
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,901
I Can't Really "Afford"
Any...

378
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:37,735
Extra Help Right Now.

379
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:40,237
I'm A Good Worker
And I'm Open To Barter.

380
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:44,108
Uh...What Do You
Have In Trade?

381
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,800
Nicki,

382
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,302
How Did I Get Home
Last Night?

383
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:13,003
<I>Nicki:
I Don't Know, But...</I>

384
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,906
<I>I Got Home
In A '65 Mustang.</I>

385
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:16,974
<I>Are You Home Now?</I>

386
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:18,776
And Hung Over.

387
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:21,111
<I>( Chuckling )
You Lush.</I>

388
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:25,015
<I>Meet Me
At "Hooker On A Stump."
Okay.</I>

389
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,922
Whoa.

390
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,123
Nice Shoes.

391
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,893
School Let Out
Early Today?

392
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:37,628
And You Are?

393
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,028
Mac.

394
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,265
Dad Hired Me
To Work On The House.

395
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,866
Brilliant.

396
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,201
I'm Just On My Way

397
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:47,204
To Audition
For A Christmas Play.

398
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,008
When You See My Dad,
Will You Tell Him That?

399
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,243
And That I'll
Be A Little Late.

400
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:54,745
Okay?

401
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,067
Ashley: Hey.
Oh.

402
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,235
Hey.

403
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,971
Do You Wanna Go
To A House Party Tonight?

404
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,007
Sharon's Too Burned.

405
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:23,841
I Have To Be Back Home

406
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:26,076
Before She And Jason
Get Back From Dinner.

407
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,978
Just Come For A Little While.

408
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,946
But You're, Uh,

409
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:29,947
Gonna Have To Wear Something

410
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:32,249
<I>A Little Better Than That.</I>

411
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:34,018
No Money.

412
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,920
You Know--Come Here.

413
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:40,791
You Don't Have To Always
Pay For Everything.

414
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,694
Nicki,

415
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:44,728
You Shoplift?

416
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,898
Where Do You Think
I Get All My Stuff?

417
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,404
Hello, Angelina.

418
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,839
Hi, Mr. L.

419
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,209
Um, I Made This Shirt
For Jason.

420
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,144
I Hand-Embroidered It.

421
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:02,713
You Don't Think It's
Too Feminine, Do You?

422
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:05,449
No. It Reminds Me
Of What I Used To Wear.

423
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,018
Jason's Having Dinner
With His Mother.

424
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,852
Really?
Yeah.

425
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,955
You Don't Have To Lie
If He's With Another Girl.

426
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,091
Oh. Come In.

427
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:14,825
So,

428
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:16,126
What Makes You Think

429
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:19,029
He Wouldn't Be Having Dinner
With His Mother?

430
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,364
I Never See Him Anymore.

431
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,032
Saw Him Last Night.

432
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,001
Or Doesn't Studying
Count Anymore?

433
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:28,372
No, I Haven't Seen Jason
In Two Weeks.

434
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,409
New Friends
Are Such Scumbags.

435
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,746
What New Friends
You Talking About?

436
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:37,381
Did Jason Make This?

437
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,215
Yes, He Did.

438
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,318
That Was His Christmas Present
To Me Last Year.

439
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,055
He Made Me A Beautiful
Jewelry Box.

440
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:50,027
You Know We Plan To Have
Our Own Business Someday?

441
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:52,763
Me Doing The Whole
Clothes-Design Thing,

442
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:55,232
And Jason Doing His Woodwork.


443
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:55,799
Nice.

444
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,936
So Maybe He's Been
Spending More Time At The Shop.

445
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:00,104
Nice Try.

446
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:03,107
But They Haven't Seen Him
In Over A Month.

447
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:07,177
He Even Left A Rocker
He Was Working On Half-Finished.

448
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:10,214
I Don't Know What
To Tell You, Baby.

449
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,349
Well, Just Give Him This.

450
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,383
I'll Have A Talk With Him.

451
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:17,955
No. I'm The One That Needs
To Have A Talk With Im.

452
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,091
You're Really Okay, Mr. L.

453
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,926
Thank You.

454
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,428
Sometimes I Wonder.

455
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,532
Okay, Well,
I'm Gonna Go.

456
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,970
Have A Good Day, Baby.
Thanks.

457
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:36,206
So, What's Been
Keeping My Track Star

458
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,441
Away From Home So Much?

459
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,043
It's Not A Girl, Is It?

460
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:40,944
No, Uh-Uh.

461
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,012
As A Matter Of Fact,

462
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:45,115
I Stood Up Angel Last Night
So I Could Study.

463
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,384
You're Still Seeing Her?

464
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,921
Does Her Mother
Still Work At Wal-Mart?

465
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:52,055
Whoa! Mom, For Real?

466
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,257
Come On--Her Mom's Cool,
All Right?

467
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:56,460
I Mean, Besides, I Might Need
To Get A Job There, Myself.

468
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:57,294
You Get An Allowance.

469
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,097
Yeah, But Dad's Cutting Back
Till I Get My Grades Up.

470
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,132
<I>I Need Money Now.</I>

471
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,233
For What?

472
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,569
Something Wrong?

473
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:06,303
Nuh-Uh.

474
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,405
My Cross-Trainers
Just Gettin' Old.

475
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,407
I Forgot.

476
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:15,546
At Your Age, Things Get Old
Five Minutes Ago, Right? Mmm?

477
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,115
How Much You Need, Baby?

478
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:20,384
350.

479
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,220
For Cross-Trainers?

480
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:23,921
Well, I Mean,

481
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:25,856
The Whole Team's Gettin'
These Leather Jackets, Right?

482
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:27,591
I Guess I Could
Settle For A Nylon Jacket,

483
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:31,261
But I Know You Don't
Want Your Boy Rocking
No Nylon Jacket At School.

484
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,429
I Only Got 150, Jay.

485
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:33,897
No, That's Cool.
That's Cool.

486
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:34,932
That's Enough For The Shoes.

487
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,201
But We Can Go Shopping Together
For That Jacket, Right?

488
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:39,336
I Mean, You--
You Can Charge It, Right?

489
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,939
Right.

490
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,142
You're The Best, Mom.

491
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,478
I Love You, Too, Baby.

492
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,182
<I>So, Baby, I Know I Haven't
Been To The Track Meets Lately,</I>

493
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,319
And I'm Sorry, But You
Know I've Been Working Hard
With This Committee.

494
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:56,353
You Know? Go Green.
Yeah.

495
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,056
But I Really Wanna
Talk To You About That Angel.

496
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:00,958
What?
I Don't Like Her.

497
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,125
Huh?

498
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:02,960
I Just Don't.

499
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:05,462
I-I Just Feel Like She's...
In The Way Of Your Future.

500
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:08,599
She's Needy.
She Didn't Even
Do Anything To You.

501
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,033
She's Needy. Just Saying.

502
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,903
Okay, Okay.
You Need To Try Something New.

503
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:15,005
New Like What?
What's New?

504
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:16,073
Keep It Movin'.Com.

505
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,208
What Is That?
Did You Just Make That Up?

506
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,610
Well, Maybe.

507
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:23,480
Okay.
Might Be A Site With Some
New Booty On It.

508
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,282
Mom!

509
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:26,583
Ahh.

510
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,518
The Jacket
Looks Nice On You.
Right?

511
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,989
Thank You.
Thank You To My Mom.


512
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,660
Why Are You
Sitting In The Dark?

513
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,195
Where Were You Last Night?

514
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:39,997
Uh...I-I Was Studying

515
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:40,664
Like I Told You.

516
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,532
You Haven Seen Angelina
In Weeks.

517
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,968
I Just Figured That
Studying With Angel Would...

518
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,105
Um, Just Distract Me
A Little Bit.

519
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:49,373
He Already Told Me.

520
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,341
Just Where Have You
Been Going?

521
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,010
Bill...
I Asked You A Question.

522
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:56,113
The Library. What--A Guy
Tries To Do The Right Thing,

523
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,281
And I Get Jumped For It?

524
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:59,483
Are You Trying
To Do The Right Thing?

525
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:00,484
Yes--


526
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:02,686
Your Father's Finished
With His Questions.

527
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:05,689
Go On Upstairs
And Study, Baby.

528
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:10,627
Well,

529
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:13,397
You've Managed To Ruin
A Perfectly Lovely Evening.

530
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:17,301
<I>Bill: Just Trying
To Make Him Live Up
To His Responsibilities.</I>

531
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:19,603
<I>He Only Comes Home
Long Enough To Eat</I>

532
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:20,971
And To Ask For More Money.

533
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:23,407
Sharon: Like Your Daughter's
Home More?

534
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:24,474
My Son's An Athlete,

535
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:27,544
And One Day He's
Going To Be Important.

536
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:30,380
He's Important Now, Sharon.

537
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,215
Has It Ever Occurred To You
That Jason

538
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,517
Doesn't Even
Wanna Be An Athlete?

539
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,719
Then Why Is He Trying So Hard
To Make Captain?

540
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,521
He's Not.
If You'd Come To Any

541
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,289
Of His Track Meets,
You'd Know.

542
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,590
He--He'll Never Be Captain.

543
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:41,959
Your Daughter's The Loser.

544
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,328
And She Dresses
Like Trailer Trash.

545
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,297
<I>Bill: If Ashley's Mother
Was Home Once In A While--</I>

546
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:51,535
Oh, Please.
I'm Up In This Dump
More Than I Care To Be.

547
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:52,636
Charming.

548
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:53,570
If A--
Maybe,

549
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,706
<I>Maybe If We
Got This Place Together...</I>

550
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:58,108
Let's Get You Back.

551
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,983
No Life, Huh?

552
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,552
This Is Gross.

553
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,422
It May Not Look Like
Much Now, But, Uh,

554
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,758
Wait Till I
Get The Drapes Up.

555
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,227
This Place Is A Hole.

556
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:23,100
It Just...
Needs A Little Love.

557
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,437
Yeah.

558
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,540
Well, Don't We All?

559
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,176
Why Don't You Put This On?

560
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,579
It's...

561
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:37,781
Warmer.

562
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:44,087
And Why Don't You
Take Care Of Willy?

563
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:50,494
Bill: What, Did You Guys
Buy Out The Entire Store?

564
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:52,763
Sneaking In Again?

565
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:55,098
I Just Fed Willy.

566
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,567
Thank You, Baby.

567
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,637
What Was She Wearing?

568
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:04,441
( Chuckles )
Looked Like It
Was From A Thrift Store.

569
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:51,521
Jason,
I Need To Talk To You!

570
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,723
Are You Sure You Wouldn't
Rather Talk To My Father?

571
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,192
<I>I Came To See You.
You Weren't Home.</I>

572
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:57,260
Why'd You Tell Him We Haven't
Been Studying Together?

573
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,529
I Didn't Know You
Told Him We Were.
Look, I---

574
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,865
I Just Can't Have Any More
Hassles Right Now.

575
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:04,201
Don't Shut Me Out.

576
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,236
Mmm.

577
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,843
Let's Go Somewhere.

578
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:13,677
Is Your Mom Home?

579
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,579
She Leaves For Work
In About An Hour.

580
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:17,280
I Don't Think
I Can Wait That Long.

581
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,650
Promise Me You'll Come Over
This Time.

582
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,319
I Love You.

583
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,321
Promise.

584
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,825
Believe It.

585
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,604
That Is One Hot
Little Piece Of Ass.

586
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:43,306
You Shut Up About Her.
You Hear Me?

587
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,913
That's Not How You
Talk To Me.

588
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,688
Thanks.

589
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,325
You, Too, Willy.

590
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,761
You're Welcome.

591
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,701
You'll Make A Terrific
Virgin Mary.

592
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:12,569
Shut Up.

593
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:14,704
Who Said I Was A Virgin?

594
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,840
I Was Talking About The Play.

595
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:20,710
And Being A Virgin Is Bad
Because...Why?

596
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,746
'Cause Nobody Else Is.

597
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:25,549
There May Be One Or Two.

598
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,351
And What Play Are You
Talking About?

599
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,188
Hello? The Christmas Play.

600
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,856
Mary, Baby Jesus,

601
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:33,890
Wise Men.

602
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,192
You Auditioned For It.

603
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:37,360
Remember?

604
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,896
No One Does That Kind
Of Play Anymore.

605
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:43,266
It's Not Politically Correct.


606
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,402
Oh.

607
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,442
I Ran Across This
When I Was Cleaning.

608
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,379
Wait.

609
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,216
Sharon Was In The Band
With My Mom And Dad?

610
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:02,586
Evidently. She Was Pregnant
And Depressed.

611
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,788
Her Boyfriend Left Her.

612
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,823
She Didn't Want The Baby.

613
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:09,359
The Plan Was For Your Mother
To Watch After Both Kids

614
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:11,461
While Sharon Filled In
With The Band.

615
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:12,596
How Do You Know All This?

616
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:13,997
Your Father Asked Me
To Look Over Things

617
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:18,301
So I Wouldn't Throw Out
Anything Important.

618
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,804
This Seemed Important.

619
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:23,540
And...Kinda Personal.

620
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,408
So I Stopped Reading.

621
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,810
Thanks.

622
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,513
Would You Be Willing
To Do Me A Favor?

623
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:31,881
That Depends.

624
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,550
There's A Bunch Of Kids
Down At The Shelter

625
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:37,887
Who Don't Know It's
Not Politically Correct
To Have A Christmas Play.

626
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,723
They'd Really
Like To Have One,

627
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:42,259
And I Could Really
Use A Good Acting Coach.

628
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:45,595
I Can't Act.

629
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,265
Huh.

630
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,534
I--

631
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:54,838
What Makes You
Think That's Mine?

632
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,539
You See?

633
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:00,377
You Can Give
Quite A Performance.

634
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:03,346
So, I Have No Choice.

635
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:04,014
No.

636
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:05,682
But I Think You'll Like It.

637
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:09,986
It's Three Days A Week,
And A Half-Day Saturdays.

638
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:18,762
Come Back To Bed
And Hold Me.

639
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,602
You Could At Least
Help Me With The Bed.

640
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,570
You Helped Mess It Up.

641
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,538
Don't Be Mad, Angel.

642
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,940
Do You Still
Love Me, Jason?

643
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:08,778
You're The Only Girl I Dated
Since The 7th Grade.

644
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,448
You Never Say It.

645
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,716
Uh--

646
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:14,551
You've Been My Lady

647
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:15,985
Since I First Saw You
At The Halloween Party

648
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:19,489
Rolling Around On The Floor
In That Stupid Pumpkin Costume.

649
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,998
I'm Pregnant.

650
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,469
You're Kidding, Right?

651
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:33,536
No.

652
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,939
I Did The Test.

653
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:38,608
Three Times.

654
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,680
What Are You Going To Do?

655
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:46,483
We Could Get Married In Kentucky
On Account Of I'm Pregnant.

656
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:48,451
Kentucky?
Are You Out Of Your Gourd?

657
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,120
We Can't Keep It.

658
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:52,555
What Do You Mean?

659
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,458
Give Me A Break.

660
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,926
What Do You Want Me To Do?

661
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,028
What We Always Talked About.

662
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,865
You Should've
Been More Careful.

663
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,867
"Careful" Works Both Ways.

664
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,702
What--What
About All Your Talk

665
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:06,870
About Us Being Together
Forever?

666
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:08,838
I Didn't Mean
Like This Week!

667
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,874
And Besides,
We Have No Money.

668
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:13,510
You Can Make Good Money
As A Carpenter.

669
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:14,878
You're Great At It.

670
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,113
Angel, Baby...

671
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,417
This...Just Isn't A Good Time

672
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:21,184
To Get Married.

673
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:24,154
You Can See That,
Can't You?

674
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:32,695
All Right,

675
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,031
I'll Get The Money
For The Abortion.

676
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:38,868
Geez, All Anybody Ever
Wants Out Of Me Is Money.

677
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,804
That Is Not True!

678
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:43,173
I Love You, Jason.

679
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:48,077
This Is Our Child.
How Can You Even
Think Of Destroying It?

680
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,145
Well, You Better
Think Of It.

681
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:51,881
'Cause I'm Not
Gonna Be Trapped By You

682
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:52,682
Or Anyone Else.

683
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:55,919
Don't Say A Word About This
To Anyone.

684
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,621
Jason!

685
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,937
Now, Not Everybody
Will Have A Speaking Part.

686
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:17,540
But Everyone Will
Have A Very Important Role.

687
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,709
You All Have Special Talents.

688
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:22,712
Kevin Doesn't.
He's Lame.

689
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,181
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

690
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,618
Kids, I'd Like You All
To Meet Ms. Lane.

691
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,488
Children: Hi, Ms. Lane.

692
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,724
Are You Lois Lane,
Superman's Wife?

693
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:37,927
No, Duck-Brain.
Superman's Wife Is Old.

694
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:40,129
All Right. Kids,
I'll Be Right Back.

695
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:43,132
Everyone Just
Behave Yourselves.

696
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:47,604
You're Not Scared Of A Few
Second-Graders?

697
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,272
No.

698
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,208
It's The Sixth-Graders
That I'm Worried About.

699
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,611
Look, If You're
Having Second Thoughts,

700
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:56,079
This Is The Time To Decide.

701
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:58,515
Uh--You're The One
Who Asked Me To Do This.

702
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,650
And I Think You'll
Be Great At It.

703
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:01,551
But That Doesn't Mean

704
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:04,220
You Can Quit If You Go Down
And Change Your Mind Later.

705
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:06,055
Give Me Your Word.

706
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:15,098
Yeah. You Have My Word.

707
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:15,965
Good.

708
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:16,900
The Second Chapter Of Luke

709
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:19,302
Is The Theme For The Script
We're Gonna Need.

710
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:22,739
Wait, You Want Me
To Help Write The Script?

711
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:23,573
No.

712
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:25,842
I Want You To Write It.

713
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:29,712
Oh, And By The Way,
We Need 17 Speaking Parts.

714
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,548
Seventeen?

715
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,150
Everyone That Wants
To Work On Scenery,

716
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:37,020
Come This Way.

717
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:41,991
Go, Jason!
Whoo!

718
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:43,593
Oh, No.

719
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,878
Oh, Buddy.

720
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,738
I Warned You About That
Superstar Stuff, Lane!

721
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,307
But Coach, If Hank
Had Just Been There For Me
When I Reached Back,

722
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,343
None Of This
Would've Happened.
Bullshit!

723
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:34,811
You Started Too Soon.

724
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:38,214
And When Hank Was Closing In
On You, You Sped Up,

725
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:38,982
Crossed Lanes,

726
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:40,750
Disqualified The Whole Team.

727
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:44,354
This Sport
Isn't All About You.

728
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:45,388
Get It

729
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,090
I Can Change, Coach.

730
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:48,057
I Can.

731
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:50,226
Show Me.

732
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,411
That Was Too Close For Me.

733
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:18,781
I Don't Know Why You
Made Such A Big Deal Out Of It.

734
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:21,384
Just Sunglasses.

735
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:23,419
We Were Stealing.

736
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:26,089
That's Not Okay.

737
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:32,495
There's Gotta Be A Better Way
To Enjoy Life.

738
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,264
Oh, There Is.

739
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:37,366
He's Comin' Right This Way.

740
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:40,303
Hi, I'm Ken.

741
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:42,271
And You Are?

742
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:43,473
Barbie.

743
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:45,007
I'm Barbie.

744
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:47,009
You Like To Dance?

745
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,379
Only If You Buy Me
A Pink House.

746
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,783
Some Friends
Are Having A Party Later.

747
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:55,284
Wanna Come?

748
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:01,457
Cheers, Darling.

749
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,133
Tell Nicole I Had To Leave.

750
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:14,036
Nicole? I Thought Her Name
Was Barbie.

751
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:15,838
Hey, Jay.

752
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,908
You Just Gonna Walk In
And Not Speak?

753
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,110
Hey.

754
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,013
How Was The Meet?

755
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:25,248
You Were Supposed To Come.

756
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,283
I Know Baby, But...

757
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,918
The Protest Got Started Late.

758
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,853
Somebody Forgot
To Bring Their Permit.

759
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:32,455
You Know--
Spare Me, Mom.

760
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:33,156
I'm Sorry.

761
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:35,224
I'm Gonna Go Hang Out
With Some Of The Guys.

762
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:36,959
I'm Already Running Late.
So...

763
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:38,828
Oh, By The Way.

764
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,296
I, Uh--I Need Some Money.

765
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,266
I Just Gave You Some.
What Happened To The Money
That I Gave You?

766
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:47,003
You Know I'm A Growing Boy.
I Gotta Eat, Right?

767
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:47,503
Uh, Well,

768
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:50,339
You Are Eatin' Me
Out Of House And Home.

769
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:52,241
Here's A 20.

770
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:53,976
Where's Your Jacket At?

771
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,444
It's Cold Outside.

772
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:56,179
Uh, I, Uh...

773
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:59,315
Left It In My Locker
Earlier.


774
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,818
Can I Get A Hug?

775
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:06,823
Mmm.

776
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,395
Be Careful, Jay.

777
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:16,332
Um, Sharon?

778
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,267
Yes?
Have You Seen Mac?

779
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:21,370
We're Supposed To Work
On A Project Together.

780
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:23,206
No, I Haven't.

781
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:24,841
But You're Home Early.

782
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:27,510
You Look Good.
I'm Impressed.

783
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:28,311
Thanks.

784
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:31,914
Your Father And I
Are Gonna Go To A Go Green
Benefit Tonight.

785
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:33,983
You'll Be Okay By Yourself?

786
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:37,119
Yeah. Have A Good Time.

787
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:39,388
I Like Those Shoes.

788
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,459
Hmm.

789
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:06,515
Wow.

790
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,184
Look At This Place.

791
00:48:08,186 --> 00:48:10,219
How's The Play Coming?

792
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,289
Do You Own A Dress Coat?

793
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:14,290
Yes.

794
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:16,626
Why Do You Ask?

795
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:17,526
I Couldn't Find Luke.

796
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:20,963
There's A Table Of Contents
In The Front Of The Book.

797
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:25,034
Or You Could Just
Google It.

798
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,684
Don't You Look Handsome?

799
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:42,451
So Do You, Honey.

800
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:44,387
I Love That Dress.
Thank You.

801
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:48,524
Can You Believe That Ashley
And I Had A Conversation Today?

802
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:50,326
You Did?
Oh, Yeah.

803
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:51,160
About What?

804
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:52,228
Well, She's Working On, Uh,

805
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,598
Some New Project,
And I Encouraged Her.

806
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,200
Oh, Baby.
Mm-Hmm.

807
00:48:58,202 --> 00:48:59,936
Thank You.
Ooh Ooh.

808
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:02,438
Uh--Watch Out, Now.

809
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:06,108
Actually I Should
Be Thanking You.

810
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:06,709
For What?

811
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:08,244
Well, For The Garden,

812
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:10,646
The Bushes, The New Flowers.

813
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:11,314
Mm-Hmm.

814
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:15,584
I Can Actually Park The Car
In The Garage Again.

815
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:16,452
Who Knew?

816
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,188
You're The Best.
Mwah.

817
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,022
Mm-Hmm.

818
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:21,290
Oh, Do You Have A 20?

819
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,259
Here You Go.

820
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,363
Bill, You Only Have A 20.

821
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:29,565
Nah, I've Got A 20
And A 50.

822
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:30,333
Mmm, No. Look.

823
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:32,268
Only A 20.
Don't Worry About It.

824
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,203
I-I'll Go To The Bank
Tomorrow, Okay?

825
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:35,638
Grab An Arm.
Fo' Sho'.

826
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,008
Here We Go.

827
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,489
I Just Need Some Stuff.

828
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,257
And?

829
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:56,525
I, Uh...

830
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:59,095
I Brought--
I Brought Money.

831
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,709
What's Wrong?

832
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,379
Huh?

833
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:20,049
Wait! Please, Please,
I'm Sick.

834
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:33,696
Please, Please,
Please, Guys.

835
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:38,701
Please.

836
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:41,737
I'll Do Whatever You Want!

837
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:43,572
I'm Begging You, Geo.

838
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:44,573
Please.

839
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:45,241
Please!

840
00:50:45,243 --> 00:50:48,411
Then You're
Working With Roach.

841
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,746
Ashley, You Okay?

842
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:52,615
Where'd You
Go The Other Night?

843
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:54,183
I Gotta Write A Play.

844
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:57,119
Did You Just Say,
"Write A Play"?

845
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:57,820
I Gotta Go.

846
00:50:57,822 --> 00:51:01,323
It's Just Not As Much Fun
Without You.

847
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:03,159
Then Go Home For A Change.

848
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:05,461
I'll Talk To You Tomorrow.

849
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,264
Okay.

850
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:19,869
I've Never
Read That Before.

851
00:52:19,871 --> 00:52:21,137
That's Good.

852
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:23,672
You'll Write
With A Fresh Perspective.

853
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,208
I Still Don't Know

854
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:29,445
How I'm Gonna
Get 17 Parts Out Of It.

855
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,414
Put Yourself
In Their Positions.

856
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:34,383
What Would You Think?

857
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,754
Yeah, But 17 Parts?

858
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,190
When Was The Last Time
You Saw A Bunch Of People

859
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:43,659
<I>Get Together And Not
Have A Lot To Say?</I>

860
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:46,762
All The Time At My House.

861
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,799
Bring It Back.

862
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,169
Come Here.

863
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,171
Good Boy.

864
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:57,606
Good Boy.

865
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:04,680
Nick. What Happened?

866
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,883
Did Ken Do This?

867
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,686
I Just Went Home

868
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,588
Like You Said.

869
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:15,491
My Old Man
Was Drunk Again.

870
00:53:15,493 --> 00:53:17,793
I Should've Known Better.

871
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,831
It's Not Your Fault.

872
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,368
You're Safe Now.

873
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,505
Let's Get You
To A Hospital.

874
00:53:29,507 --> 00:53:31,373
No.

875
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:34,677
Don't Be Afraid.

876
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,446
Let Me Help You.

877
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:43,485
I'll...Get A First Aid Kit.

878
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,791
Let's Get You Inside.

879
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,494
Trust Me.

880
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,375
Okay, All Right.

881
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:18,754
All Right.

882
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:44,046
Why Does He Hate Me?

883
00:54:44,048 --> 00:54:46,015
He Hates Himself.

884
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:49,318
Why Does He Do This To Me?

885
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,854
He Doesn't Know Love.

886
00:54:51,856 --> 00:54:53,455
That Makes Him Dangerous.

887
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,024
No Shit.

888
00:54:55,026 --> 00:54:57,626
He's A Monster.

889
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,797
How Do I Make Him Stop?

890
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:02,965
You Can't.

891
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:05,567
So I Just Let Him
Keep Beating Me?

892
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:08,604
I Definitely
Don't Recommend That.

893
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:10,506
Then What?

894
00:55:10,508 --> 00:55:12,408
Do You Want Things
To Change?

895
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:15,044
That's An Insane Question.

896
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:17,680
Then You Need To Report This
To The Police.

897
00:55:17,682 --> 00:55:19,415
What He Did Was Criminal.

898
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:20,683
He'll Kill Me.

899
00:55:20,685 --> 00:55:23,419
Look, I Know You're Scared.

900
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,521
It's A Difficult Decision.

901
00:55:25,523 --> 00:55:26,922
I Understand.

902
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:30,459
But It's One
You've Got To Make.

903
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,762
He Won't Stop.

904
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,867
Ever Consider Leaving Home?

905
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:41,837
Only Every Day.

906
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:42,638
I'm 17.

907
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,106
I Don't Got A Place To Go.

908
00:55:44,108 --> 00:55:48,077
I Don't Want To End Up
Sleeping On The Streets.

909
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,081
You Can Stay With Me.

910
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:57,052
It's The First Place
He'd Look.

911
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,524
This Is The Number
For A Friend Of Mine.

912
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:05,894
Her Father Had A Lot
In Common With Yours.

913
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:07,930
She Can Give You
A Place To Stay

914
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:10,933
Right Now, If You Want It.

915
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:19,875
Yeah, Okay.

916
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,043
Okay.

917
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,077
Good.

918
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:26,782
And If You're Up
For Riding A Bike,
I'll Take You There Tonight.

919
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,151
Sorry.

920
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:32,454
It's Gonna Burn A Little.

921
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,126
Thank God You're Home.

922
00:56:37,128 --> 00:56:40,462
Where Else Would I Be?

923
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:44,099
It's Me, Nick.

924
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:45,167
Where Are You?

925
00:56:45,169 --> 00:56:49,805
I've Left Tons
Of Messages And Texts.

926
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:51,707
Call Me.

927
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,411
Why Won't You Just Tell Me
Where You Took Nicki?

928
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:58,013
I Promise I Won't
Tell Anybody.

929
00:56:58,015 --> 00:57:00,416
I Gave Her My Word.

930
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:00,949
She's Okay.

931
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:03,752
She'll Be In Touch
When She's Ready.

932
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:07,089
Okay, Guys.
Um, There Are 17 Parts

933
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:08,590
And We Need Some Singers.

934
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,793
So, Who Can Sing?

935
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:18,133
Oh, Mr. Blackman?

936
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:20,769
I'm Working On A Play
Down At The Shelter,

937
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,105
And We Need To Find Costumes
And Props--

938
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:27,176
Young Lady, Our Department
Is Grossly Underfunded

939
00:57:27,178 --> 00:57:28,143
And Understaffed.

940
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:29,778
We Need Those Things
Ourselves.

941
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,514
I Wasn't Asking For Things.

942
00:57:32,516 --> 00:57:33,515
Just Advice.

943
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:36,885
Well, I'm Sorry
I Can't Help You.

944
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,887
Mr. Evans,

945
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,088
You've Been Told Before

946
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,991
We Cannot Have That
Horrible Smell In Here.

947
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:44,493
They're Sanding
Down In The Shop.

948
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:47,796
And If You Don't Want Your
Backdrop Covered In Sawdust,
I Can't Do It There.

949
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:50,065
Yeah, Well, You Can't
Do It Here, Either.

950
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:52,067
There's Nowhere Else.

951
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:54,169
Maybe You'd Rather I Quit.

952
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:54,837
Fine,

953
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:57,506
As Long As You
Return The Paint And Supplies

954
00:57:57,508 --> 00:58:01,510
You Were Advanced
For Your Personal Use.

955
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:02,678
Good-Bye.

956
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,218
Do I Know You?

957
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,053
You Look Familiar.

958
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:12,154
You Don't.

959
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,889
Are You Always
This Friendly?

960
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:15,691
Only When I've
Just Been Fired.

961
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:17,626
Oh, Let Me Give You A Hand.

962
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:18,727
I'm Ashley.

963
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:20,529
Jonathan.

964
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:25,667
Oh.

965
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,810
Thanks.

966
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:48,257
Jonathan: I Know It's A Mess,
But Can I Give You A Lift?

967
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:49,725
Are You Kidding?

968
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,760
It's A Real Car!

969
00:58:51,762 --> 00:58:52,661
Is It Yours?

970
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:53,862
Actually, It's A Van.

971
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,731
It's Not Completely
Paid For Yet,

972
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:57,866
But It's More Or Less Mine.

973
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,908
I'll Get That For You.
Oh.

974
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,010
Thank You.

975
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,091
You're, Um...

976
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:24,860
Different.

977
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:28,597
I'll...Take That
As A Compliment.

978
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:33,201
So, You Do, Like, What?

979
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:34,636
Stage Painting?

980
00:59:34,638 --> 00:59:36,038
Um, Well, You Know,

981
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,806
Blackman Needed
Some Cheap Labor,

982
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:41,310
And I Needed Some Supplies
And A Space To Work.

983
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:44,846
Course, Now I
Don't Have Either.

984
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,249
I Have An Idea.

985
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:49,651
I'll Alert The Media.

986
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:54,823
Your Line.

987
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:55,357
Hey.
Hey.

988
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:58,794
Uh, Guys, Do You Mind
Helping Me Out A Little Bit?
Yeah, Yeah.

989
00:59:58,796 --> 01:00:00,195
Thank You.

990
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:02,297
Uh, Mac,

991
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:03,131
This Is Jonathan.

992
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:06,301
Jonathan, This Is The Guy
That I Was Telling You About.
Hey.

993
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:07,736
Don't Tell Me.

994
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:09,905
Ashley Offered You
A Place To Work

995
01:00:09,907 --> 01:00:14,076
If You Do A Simple
Backdrop For Our Play.

996
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:15,978
Yeah.

997
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,914
Uh, So Are You
In Charge Here?

998
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:20,282
Allegedly.

999
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:21,316
I'm Just A Volunteer.

1000
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:23,385
Uh, What Do You Need?

1001
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,821
An Area That's Off-Limits

1002
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:27,723
<I>Would Be Really Helpful.</I>

1003
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:29,124
Yeah. This Way.

1004
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,158
Okay, Good Job, Everybody.

1005
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,894
I'll Be Right Back.
Memorize Your Lines.

1006
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:35,864
Ms. Lane, Kevin Took My Script
To The Bathroom

1007
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:39,368
And Flushed It,
But It Wouldn't Go Down.

1008
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:41,903
We'll See About That.

1009
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:43,138
Jonathan?

1010
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,841
Would You Mind Going
To The Little Boys' Room

1011
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:50,846
And Retrieving Darlene's
Script Back, Please?

1012
01:00:58,788 --> 01:00:59,855
Hey, Um,

1013
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:01,723
M-Maybe After We're
Finished Today,

1014
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:03,058
I Could Give You
A Ride Home?

1015
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,861
Unless You Have,
Like, Other Plans

1016
01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:07,029
Or Something.

1017
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:07,963
No!

1018
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:10,032
I Mean, Yes.

1019
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:12,100
I Never Have Plans.

1020
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:14,903
I-I Mean I Don't
Have Plans Today.

1021
01:01:14,905 --> 01:01:18,006
I--That Is...
Plans To Rehearse,

1022
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:20,375
But Nothing After That.

1023
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:23,278
I'd Love A Ride.

1024
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,447
Okay.

1025
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,219
Has Jason Left Already?

1026
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,388
I Couldn't Wake Him.
He's Still Upstairs.

1027
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:35,390
Don't Talk With Your
Mouth Full.

1028
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:36,825
Have You Seen My
Diamond Earrings?

1029
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:39,795
You Didn't Borrow Them
Or Anything, Did You?

1030
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:41,463
No, I Haven't.

1031
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:45,067
You've Been Looking Nice
Recently.

1032
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:46,234
Well, I Have Been...

1033
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:49,004
I've Been Talking
To This Guy, And--

1034
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:50,105
Ahh.

1035
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:53,175
Yeah, He's--
Oh, Just A Sec.

1036
01:01:53,177 --> 01:01:54,076
Hello?

1037
01:01:54,078 --> 01:01:55,977
Are You Serious?

1038
01:01:55,979 --> 01:01:56,411
What?!

1039
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:58,146
I Needed Those Boards,
Like, Yesterday.

1040
01:01:58,148 --> 01:02:02,284
How Else Are We Gonna
Motivate These People
To Go Green?

1041
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:04,753
Yes! Motivation, Okay?

1042
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:06,221
What A Concept.

1043
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:10,025
Where Have You Been, Girl?

1044
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:12,260
You Haven't Answered
Any Of My Calls.

1045
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:13,095
I've Been Worried.

1046
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:16,865
I'm Not Living At Home
Anymore, So I Just...

1047
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:18,133
Left My Phone There.

1048
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:19,334
Where Are You Staying?

1049
01:02:19,336 --> 01:02:20,402
Are You All Right?

1050
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:22,003
You Look Fabulous.

1051
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:23,205
Thanks.

1052
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:25,173
You Do, Too. Uh...

1053
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,409
Do You Wanna
Do Something Tonight?

1054
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:30,846
I Have To Figure Out How
To Costume 17 Kids

1055
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:31,913
With No Money.

1056
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,148
Wanna Help?

1057
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:35,350
No, I Don't Think So.

1058
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:36,251
Really Gotten Carried Away

1059
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,220
With This Whole
Volunteering Thing, Huh?

1060
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:40,055
Yeah, The Kids Love Doing It.

1061
01:02:40,057 --> 01:02:41,056
It'll Be Fun.

1062
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:43,825
Besides, We Need To Talk.

1063
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:45,227
Not Really.

1064
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:48,096
Just--At Least Not Yet.

1065
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:51,333
See You Around, Though.

1066
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:53,969
Okay.

1067
01:02:56,873 --> 01:03:00,242
I've...Really Missed You.

1068
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,547
Yeah, Me Too.

1069
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,790
Hit The Showers, Men.

1070
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:16,191
Hank.

1071
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:17,125
Yeah, Coach?

1072
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,227
What's Up With Lane?
Where Is He?

1073
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:21,797
I--You'll Have To Ask Him,
Coach.

1074
01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:24,132
I'm Asking You.

1075
01:03:27,237 --> 01:03:30,038
Hi, Princess.

1076
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,139
Hey.

1077
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,407
What's Up?

1078
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:34,109
So, You Know That Junk

1079
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:37,279
That Mac Has Been
Cleaning Out Of The Garage?

1080
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:38,980
Can I Have It?

1081
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,582
Why Do You Want It?

1082
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:41,416
To Sell.

1083
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:42,284
You Know That Mack And I

1084
01:03:42,286 --> 01:03:44,286
Have Been Working On This
Christmas Play.

1085
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:45,854
Mac Is Too Old For You.

1086
01:03:45,856 --> 01:03:49,124
Dad. Give Me Some Credit.

1087
01:03:49,126 --> 01:03:49,591
Ew.

1088
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:50,892
Okay.

1089
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:54,596
Ah, Whatever You Can
Make Off The Stuff
In The Garage

1090
01:03:54,598 --> 01:03:56,531
Is Yours To Keep.

1091
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,903
Something Else?

1092
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,205
Well, I...

1093
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:06,975
Found This Poster Of Your Band
In The Garage.

1094
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:09,010
You Guys Used To Rock.

1095
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:09,611
You Were Hot.

1096
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:12,113
Ashley.

1097
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:15,183
How Would You
Like To Perform Again?
I Wouldn't.

1098
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:15,984
Dad, Please?

1099
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:18,620
Our Play Would Be So Huge
With Music.

1100
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:21,489
<I>It's Just So...
Almost Now.</I>

1101
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:24,860
This Production
Needs To Be Big.

1102
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,461
Bill: You Want Me To Sing?

1103
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:29,097
And Play Keyboard.

1104
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,604
Hmm.

1105
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:40,375
Well, Sharon And I
Used To Do Duets.

1106
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:43,245
That's The Deal.

1107
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:45,647
Me And Your Mom,

1108
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:47,449
'Kay?

1109
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,985
Wow.

1110
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:53,154
Well, I--
I Guess That Could Work.

1111
01:04:53,156 --> 01:04:55,156
Okay, Well, I Gotta Go.

1112
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:57,525
I Have A Date.

1113
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,195
I'd Like To Meet Him.

1114
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:02,330
This Date.

1115
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:04,099
So I, Uh,

1116
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:06,067
Used To Sneak
Into People's Back Yards

1117
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:09,170
And Steal Charcoal
From The Barbeques

1118
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:13,408
So I Could Draw My Murals
On Buildings And Sidewalks.

1119
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,077
I Was Just A Kid.

1120
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:16,478
Wow.

1121
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,081
Your Neighbors
Must've Loved You.

1122
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:22,651
We Were Never
Around Long Enough

1123
01:05:22,653 --> 01:05:26,388
For Anyone To Notice
One Way Or The Other.

1124
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:38,934
But You Didn't Quit.

1125
01:05:38,936 --> 01:05:42,137
Jonathan: There Was One Person
Who Said I Had Potential.

1126
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:43,605
It Was The Cop
That Caught Me.

1127
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:47,676
Made Me Whitewash The Entire
Side Of The Building
I'd Just Finished.

1128
01:05:47,678 --> 01:05:48,610
That Sucks.

1129
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:54,349
Turns Out The Owner Had Rented
It Out To A Billboard Company
For Big Bucks.

1130
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,017
That Cop Got Me My First Job.

1131
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:59,187
Priming Building Sides
For Advertising.

1132
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:01,523
I've Had Way Worse
Jobs, Though.

1133
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:02,524
A Way To Make Money.

1134
01:06:02,526 --> 01:06:05,360
What Made You Keep At It?

1135
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:09,965
Would've Been Pretty Hard
To Stop Me.

1136
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:12,233
Until Recently,

1137
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:15,203
I Only Lived
And Breathed Painting.

1138
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:28,183
Hey.

1139
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:29,985
Jason's Not Here.

1140
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:33,188
It's Nice To See You, Too.

1141
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:35,023
Can I Come In?

1142
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:36,725
Yeah, Sure.

1143
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:43,465
I Need To Have 17 Costumes
Made For My Christmas Play.

1144
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:45,567
How Much Are You Paying?

1145
01:06:45,569 --> 01:06:48,303
Well, Actually...Nothing.

1146
01:06:48,305 --> 01:06:50,205
But It's For A Good Cause.

1147
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:51,006
Well, Please?

1148
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:52,474
We're Practically Family.

1149
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:54,342
I Barely Know You.

1150
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:57,612
And Your Mother Won't Even
Stay In The Same Room With Me.

1151
01:06:57,614 --> 01:06:59,481
<I>Eh-- Step-Mother,
And Consider Yourself Lucky.</I>

1152
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:02,083
Five Minutes With Her
And You're Late For The Door.

1153
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:04,486
Whatever. I Still Need
To Earn Some Cash Now.

1154
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:07,722
Um, We're Having A Garage
Sale Next Week.

1155
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:11,059
Whatever We Make,
Over Our Expenses,

1156
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:11,793
Is Yours.

1157
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:13,595
Please Say You'll Help.

1158
01:07:13,597 --> 01:07:14,729
I'm Desperate.

1159
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:16,331
Okay, I'll Tell You What.

1160
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:18,033
If You'll Help Me
With These Alterations,

1161
01:07:18,035 --> 01:07:21,202
That'll Give Me Some Time
To Help You Make Costumes.

1162
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,337
I Can't Sew.

1163
01:07:22,339 --> 01:07:23,571
I'll Teach You.

1164
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:24,773
Otherwise, No Deal.

1165
01:07:24,775 --> 01:07:27,208
But I Don't Have Time
For Anything Else.

1166
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,276
Welcome To My World.

1167
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:33,615
Well, If You Really Think
Old "Brainless" Can Help.

1168
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,087
Wow.

1169
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:44,659
What Do You Think?

1170
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:46,628
It's Great.

1171
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,163
So You Wanna Try It?

1172
01:07:48,165 --> 01:07:50,365
Um, Sure.

1173
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:52,333
I Don't...

1174
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:53,435
Know What I'm Doing.

1175
01:07:53,437 --> 01:07:55,637
Just Try It.

1176
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:57,539
Okay. Stick It In.

1177
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:58,339
Mm-Hmm.

1178
01:07:58,341 --> 01:07:59,607
Does It Matter What This--

1179
01:07:59,609 --> 01:08:00,575
Mm-Mmm.
Is This--

1180
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,511
We're Worried
About The Longer One.

1181
01:08:05,282 --> 01:08:05,680
Oop.

1182
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:06,848
Yeah, Just--
I Don't Know.

1183
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:08,183
Okay.
I Don't Know.

1184
01:08:08,185 --> 01:08:11,319
You Almost Had It. Look--

1185
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:37,745
Got More Clothes.

1186
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:38,880
Got Some Clothes For Ya.

1187
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:39,848
Oh. Okay, Wait.

1188
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,716
Wait. Before You
Put Them Down.

1189
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:43,485
Right There.

1190
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,386
Yeah. Just Dump 'Em.

1191
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:55,797
It's A Little Big.

1192
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:40,208
That Looks Good.

1193
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:42,210
Ready?
Okay.

1194
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:45,914
You're My Mannequin.

1195
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,816
Okay. Fits Really Well--

1196
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:50,752
Obviously
For A Smaller Person--

1197
01:09:50,754 --> 01:09:52,820
Have A Good Day.
You, Too.

1198
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:54,556
Peace Out.

1199
01:09:54,558 --> 01:09:55,657
Okay.

1200
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:56,558
You Know What?

1201
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:00,461
Have A Good Day.
Thank You Very Much.

1202
01:10:00,463 --> 01:10:02,797
Let It Go For Seven Bucks.

1203
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:04,599
What Do You Say?

1204
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,368
Ashley: Nicki!

1205
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:07,936
Hey.

1206
01:10:07,938 --> 01:10:09,737
You Changed Your Mind.

1207
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:11,839
Uh, We Could Really
Use Your Help.

1208
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:13,274
Yeah.

1209
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:17,612
I'm Just Here To See What's
Been Keeping You So Busy.

1210
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,316
Or Should I Say "Who"?

1211
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,285
I'm So Over
Spending Time At Bars,

1212
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:25,687
And I'm Glad You Are, Too.

1213
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:26,654
This Is Much More Fun.

1214
01:10:26,656 --> 01:10:28,223
Yeah, Spare Me The Pep Talk.

1215
01:10:28,225 --> 01:10:29,791
I Know You.

1216
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:34,796
Peace Offering.

1217
01:10:42,706 --> 01:10:43,871
That's Vodka.

1218
01:10:43,873 --> 01:10:46,708
Yeah, I Know.
It's Your Fave.
I Don't Do That Anymore.

1219
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:50,478
Look, Neither You Or My Dad
Have Ever Gone Too Long
Without A Drink.

1220
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,681
I Never Knew That You
Thought I Was Like Your Dad.

1221
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:56,851
I'm Sorry.
I Don't.

1222
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,354
Look, It's Been A Bad Week.

1223
01:10:59,356 --> 01:11:00,021
W-What's Going On?

1224
01:11:00,023 --> 01:11:02,423
You've Obviously
Been Too Busy To Care.

1225
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:03,891
I Care.
You're My Best Friend!

1226
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:06,728
But Nicki, I'm Finally
Doing Something That I Like.

1227
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:08,329
Do It With Me.

1228
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:09,864
I Don't Belong Here.

1229
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:10,965
I Don't Belong Anywhere.

1230
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:13,468
That's Not True.
I--I Want You To Meet Someone.

1231
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:16,671
You Never Used To Argue
With Me Before.

1232
01:11:16,673 --> 01:11:18,473
Look, Go Back
To Your Friends.

1233
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:19,474
Like Your Biker Buddy Said,

1234
01:11:19,476 --> 01:11:21,976
I Got A Lot Of Heavy Decisions
To Make Right Now.

1235
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:23,878
I'll See You Later.

1236
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:34,956
You've Met Ashley's
Friend Before?

1237
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,457
Maybe.

1238
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:39,894
Look, It Was Over
Three Years Ago.

1239
01:11:39,896 --> 01:11:41,729
Ashley Know About That?

1240
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:45,033
It's Nobody Else's
Business But Mine.

1241
01:11:45,035 --> 01:11:45,900
Bill!

1242
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:48,036
Can I Have A Word
With You?

1243
01:11:48,038 --> 01:11:49,537
All Right.

1244
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,083
All Right.

1245
01:12:02,085 --> 01:12:03,418
You Okay. Come On.

1246
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,453
It's Okay.

1247
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:13,695
It's All Right.

1248
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:14,696
It's All Right.

1249
01:12:14,698 --> 01:12:15,596
She'll Be All Right.

1250
01:12:15,598 --> 01:12:17,632
She Just
Shouldn't Lift Anything
With Her Condition.

1251
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:21,502
Jason Will Never Speak To Me
If He Thinks I've Told Anyone.

1252
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:25,473
This Isn't The Sort Of Thing
You Can Hide For Very Long.

1253
01:12:25,475 --> 01:12:26,107
What, You're--

1254
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:28,476
You're Having Jason's Baby?

1255
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:29,110
What's You Plans?

1256
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:32,413
I'll Go To School
Until Christmas Break,

1257
01:12:32,415 --> 01:12:33,848
And Then...

1258
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:34,916
I Don't Know.

1259
01:12:34,918 --> 01:12:39,754
It's Not The Most Complete
Set Of Plans I've Ever Heard.

1260
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:41,089
It Needs Work.

1261
01:12:41,091 --> 01:12:42,123
What Does Jason
Propose To Do?

1262
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:46,361
I Don't Know.
Okay, I Know Jason
Can Be A Real...

1263
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:47,462
Weiner At Times,

1264
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:50,431
But Deep Down,
He Really Does Care.

1265
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:53,901
I Don't Think He
Wants Either Of Us.

1266
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:55,503
He's Changed So Much.

1267
01:12:55,505 --> 01:12:58,606
Man: Hey, Could I
Get Some Help Over Here?

1268
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,644
How Long Are Those People
Gonna Be In Our Yard?

1269
01:13:03,646 --> 01:13:05,446
Looks Like A Garage Sale.

1270
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:10,585
Oh, Sharon.
Baby, It Is A Garage Sale.

1271
01:13:10,587 --> 01:13:12,687
Well It Makes Us Look Poor.

1272
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:14,589
What Is This All About?

1273
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:16,090
Seeing You Selling Off

1274
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:18,059
All Of Amanda's Old Things.

1275
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:19,961
It's Just--
I--

1276
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:23,865
I Didn't Think You'd
Mind If We Sold Them.

1277
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:28,469
Oh, Baby.

1278
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:31,739
So Nice To See You
And Ashley Getting Along

1279
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:34,475
Since She's
Been Doing The Play.

1280
01:13:34,477 --> 01:13:38,646
You Must Be Very Proud
That She's Doing Something
Creative, Huh?

1281
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:39,414
I Am.

1282
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:42,083
She's Certainly
Home A Lot More.

1283
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:42,850
Mm-Hmm.

1284
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:45,820
I Just Wish Jason Were.

1285
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:46,988
And I Wish I Knew

1286
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:49,490
Why Our Things
Keep Disappearing.

1287
01:13:49,492 --> 01:13:51,993
My Jewelry,
Money From Our Wallets.

1288
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:54,462
And Now My Mother's Silver.

1289
01:13:54,464 --> 01:13:55,663
Yeah.

1290
01:13:55,665 --> 01:13:57,198
Oh, Baby.

1291
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:03,838
Has It Ever Occurred To You
That It Might Be Jason?

1292
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,809
He's Lost A Lot Of Weight.
He Does Not Look Good.

1293
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:09,944
Bill, I'm Tired.

1294
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:12,447
Could You Just Get Rid
Of Those People Soon?

1295
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:14,816
You Betcha.
Thanks.

1296
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,120
Hey, Mac.
Hey.

1297
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:20,121
Let's Wrap This Up, Huh?

1298
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:22,924
You Got It.
Been A Long Day, Huh?

1299
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:23,624
Yes, Sir.

1300
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:26,894
We Did Really Well--
So, We Have A Few More
Things To Sell.

1301
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:29,864
Show Some Mercy!

1302
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:30,765
I'm Beat.

1303
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,500
We've Made 247

1304
01:14:32,502 --> 01:14:33,067
And 63 Cents.

1305
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:36,070
That Means We Have Enough
To Buy The Rest Of The Supplies

1306
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:38,105
And Pay Me Something.

1307
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:39,907
Maybe A Little Left Over

1308
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:42,777
For Some Paint And Canvas?

1309
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:44,812
Ashley: You're Just In It
For The Paint.

1310
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:45,813
Yeah--
And Just For That,

1311
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:49,550
I Am Not Letting You
Take Me To Pizza Tonight.

1312
01:14:49,552 --> 01:14:53,120
Um, Actually,
Can I Take A Rain Check?

1313
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:56,023
Something Sorta Came Up.

1314
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:57,792
What?

1315
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,261
Just Some Personal Stuff.

1316
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:01,529
Okay.

1317
01:15:01,531 --> 01:15:03,664
Don't Let Me Interfere, Then.

1318
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,099
Don't Be That Way.

1319
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:06,501
Here, Just Take The Keys

1320
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:07,869
And Get All The Rest
Of This--To Shelter,

1321
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:11,572
And I'll Come By
And Pick It Up Later, Okay?

1322
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,244
See You Later.

1323
01:15:16,246 --> 01:15:17,712
Bye.

1324
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:20,715
You Know What?

1325
01:15:20,717 --> 01:15:22,650
Let's Just Do The Shelter Thing
Another Day.

1326
01:15:22,652 --> 01:15:24,552
You Take The Truck,
Get Some Rest,

1327
01:15:24,554 --> 01:15:26,721
Go Home, And...
I'll Call You Later.

1328
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:29,924
Uh--Ashley! Tell Me You
Are Not Going To Follow Him.

1329
01:15:29,926 --> 01:15:32,994
Don't Worry.
I Know What I'm Doing.

1330
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:45,706
I Heard Coach Let You Go.

1331
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,141
Sorry, Buddy.

1332
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:50,011
Yeah, Well You
Could've Covered For Me.

1333
01:15:50,013 --> 01:15:51,279
I've Been Sick.

1334
01:15:51,281 --> 01:15:52,280
I Tried To Cover.

1335
01:15:52,282 --> 01:15:53,247
He Didn't Buy It.

1336
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:56,284
Everybody Knows You
Got A Problem.

1337
01:15:58,588 --> 01:16:00,555
Hey. You're My Friend!

1338
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:02,657
But You're Whacked Out, Man.

1339
01:16:02,659 --> 01:16:03,991
You Need Help.

1340
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:16,604
Hey.

1341
01:16:16,606 --> 01:16:18,573
Hi.

1342
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:19,874
Nice Shirt.

1343
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:23,210
Had These Made For Everyone
In The Play.

1344
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:24,712
Long Time, No See.

1345
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:26,647
I Didn't Think You'd
Even Remember Me.

1346
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:29,584
I Mean, It's Been
Over Three Years.

1347
01:16:29,586 --> 01:16:31,285
And That Was A Pretty
Wild Night.

1348
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:34,221
And Now You're
Dating My Best Friend.

1349
01:16:35,224 --> 01:16:36,757
Small World.

1350
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,593
Yeah. Thing Is,

1351
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:41,295
I Didn't Even Know You Two
Knew Each Other.

1352
01:16:41,297 --> 01:16:43,831
Is That A Problem For You?

1353
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:47,234
Well, I Mean, Ashley's Just
Been So Busy With The Play,

1354
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:51,238
And She's Just Beginning
To Have Confidence In Herself,

1355
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,374
And...
And You?

1356
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:54,675
And Me?

1357
01:16:54,677 --> 01:16:55,843
And, Well...

1358
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:57,945
That Subject Just
Hasn't Come Up Yet.

1359
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:01,015
You Know Me.
I'm Not Gonna Say Anything.

1360
01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:01,716
But...

1361
01:17:01,718 --> 01:17:04,986
She's Bound To Find Out
Sooner Or Later.

1362
01:17:04,988 --> 01:17:07,021
Later Would Be Better.

1363
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:09,857
I'd Just Rather
Tell Her Myself.

1364
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:12,193
So This A Real Thing?

1365
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:17,999
Looks Like You've Been Taking
Pretty Good Care Of Yourself.

1366
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:20,034
Had To.

1367
01:17:20,036 --> 01:17:21,736
Yeah.

1368
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:24,905
You Had To Do It Alone.

1369
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:29,810
I Just Couldn't Handle
Any Relationships At The Time.

1370
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:32,647
But...I'm Here For You Now.

1371
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:37,718
Don't Make Any Promises
You Can't Keep.

1372
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,990
This Is Where I'm Staying.

1373
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,328
Nobody Knows But Mac.

1374
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,930
You're Pretty Great, Nicole.

1375
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:53,034
What's The Matter, Nick?

1376
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:55,836
Ken And The Bar Boys
Not Enough Action For You?

1377
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,238
You Have
To Steal My Boyfriend?

1378
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,173
This Is Too Funny.

1379
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,342
I Know What This
Must Look Like,

1380
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:02,710
But It's--

1381
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:06,047
I'm Laughing.

1382
01:18:06,049 --> 01:18:07,214
Jonathan: Wha--

1383
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:09,383
Have A Little Faith In Me.

1384
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:12,687
I Do. Very Little.

1385
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:15,122
Wanna Reconsider
That Promise?

1386
01:18:47,356 --> 01:18:50,191
What Are You
Doing In My Room?

1387
01:18:50,193 --> 01:18:52,993
"Sharon's Had It So Tough.

1388
01:18:52,995 --> 01:18:57,865
I'm Going To Take Care
Of Jason Until She's Ready."

1389
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:06,440
Your Mother Never Really
Loved The Band Like I Did.

1390
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:11,746
But She Loved Me And Bill.

1391
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:15,483
We Thought We Were
Doing What She Wanted.

1392
01:19:15,485 --> 01:19:18,152
What Are You Talking About?

1393
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:24,158
You're A Lot Like Her.

1394
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:28,329
You're Both So Pretty.

1395
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:31,165
Are You Okay?

1396
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:35,002
I Watched You
Sell Amanda's Things.

1397
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:38,038
Have You Been Stealing My Things
And Selling Them, Too?

1398
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,407
Honestly, Sharon,
I Haven't.

1399
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:42,777
No--Why Would I?

1400
01:19:45,515 --> 01:19:47,782
I Don't Know How
To Be A Good Mother.

1401
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,483
You're Starting
To Freak Me Out.

1402
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:53,888
Why Doesn't My Son Like Me?

1403
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:56,123
I'm Gonna Go Get Daddy.

1404
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:58,225
I've Pushed Bill Away.

1405
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:01,962
Is He Gonna Leave Me, Too?

1406
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:06,066
Why Don't You Just...

1407
01:20:06,068 --> 01:20:07,802
Give Me The Diary?

1408
01:20:07,804 --> 01:20:08,803
No!

1409
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:10,004
No, No.

1410
01:20:10,006 --> 01:20:11,906
Sharon!

1411
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,876
What Is Going On?

1412
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:21,882
Hey, Sorry To Come By
So Late.

1413
01:20:21,884 --> 01:20:23,017
Your Mom's Not Home, Right?

1414
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:25,319
No, Night Shift Again.
What's Wrong?

1415
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,087
Everything.
Just Take This--

1416
01:20:27,089 --> 01:20:28,856
Most Of It's Yours, Anyway.

1417
01:20:28,858 --> 01:20:31,025
Okay, Well, Come In.

1418
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:36,063
Well, Where's Jonathan?

1419
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:38,232
With My Ex-Best Friend.

1420
01:20:38,234 --> 01:20:41,368
And Sharon's Freaking Out
About Something.

1421
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:43,204
I Don't Know.

1422
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:45,840
Will You Help Me
With This?

1423
01:20:45,842 --> 01:20:47,341
Yeah.

1424
01:20:49,111 --> 01:20:52,279
Men Are Pond Scum.

1425
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:54,982
But...What Are You Gonna Do?

1426
01:20:54,984 --> 01:20:58,352
Honestly, I Have No Idea.

1427
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,020
But I've Talked To God
About It,

1428
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:03,057
And I Know That
He's Forgiven Me,

1429
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:04,091
Which Is Definitely

1430
01:21:04,093 --> 01:21:07,461
More Than I Can
Say For My Mom At The Moment.

1431
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:10,064
So You Talk To God Directly?

1432
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:11,866
Of Course. Don't You?

1433
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:14,368
Oh, Yeah, All The Time.

1434
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:19,440
All I Know Is Jason
Needs To Get Off The Drugs.

1435
01:21:19,442 --> 01:21:21,475
Himself.

1436
01:21:21,477 --> 01:21:24,044
He Has To Decide.

1437
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:25,179
Have You Decided

1438
01:21:25,181 --> 01:21:28,115
If You're Gonna
Keep The Baby, Or...

1439
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:29,316
Go To School?

1440
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:29,884
Both.

1441
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:34,054
You Can't Be Anything
If You Haven't Finished School.

1442
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:36,523
W-What Are You Gonna
Do When The Baby Comes?

1443
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:39,093
Well My Mom
Won't Kick Me Out,

1444
01:21:39,095 --> 01:21:40,027
And Since She Works Nights,

1445
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:42,396
She'll Be Able
To Watch The Baby
During The Day.

1446
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:45,666
I'm Gonna Try To Work
For A Store Doing Alterations

1447
01:21:45,668 --> 01:21:47,001
So I Can Be With Her At Night.

1448
01:21:47,003 --> 01:21:48,569
I See You've
Decided It's A Girl.

1449
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,604
Have You Named Her Yet?

1450
01:21:50,606 --> 01:21:52,406
Shut Up.


1451
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:56,243
I'm Popular Tonight.

1452
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:00,981
You Must Be The Angel.

1453
01:22:00,983 --> 01:22:02,116
I'm A Friend Of Jazz.

1454
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:05,586
I Know Who You Are,
And You're Not Welcome Here.

1455
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:07,955
Who Are You?!
Leave Her Alone!

1456
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:16,931
Angelina's Mom
Has Already Called The Cops.

1457
01:22:16,933 --> 01:22:19,533
Your Brother's An Idiot.

1458
01:22:19,535 --> 01:22:21,101
Geo: I'm Not.

1459
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:22,136
Whore's Mom Works Nights.

1460
01:22:22,138 --> 01:22:25,205
That's When He Gets
His Free Piece Of Ass.

1461
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:26,573
Ain't That Right?

1462
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:37,451
Jazz...

1463
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:40,120
Is A Very Disappointing Boy.

1464
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:45,693
But...You Already Knew That,
Didn't You?

1465
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:48,329
Jason's Too Good For You.

1466
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:00,174
Let Her Go, Geo.

1467
01:23:00,977 --> 01:23:03,210
Everybody's Here.

1468
01:23:03,212 --> 01:23:04,111
Nice.

1469
01:23:04,113 --> 01:23:05,713
I Said, "Let Her Go"!

1470
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,629
The Money, Jazz!

1471
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,165
I Don't Have It.

1472
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:26,700
Search Him.

1473
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:33,674
I Don't Have It!

1474
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:39,446
Girl: What?!

1475
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,121
Nothin'.

1476
01:23:47,123 --> 01:23:49,690
Then This Is Our
Lucky Night.

1477
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:01,702
Bitch!

1478
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,585
We're Gonna Try This Again.

1479
01:24:18,587 --> 01:24:21,321
This Time
I Want A Better Answer.

1480
01:24:21,589 --> 01:24:24,224
The Money Is Where?

1481
01:24:26,695 --> 01:24:28,395
It's Outside.

1482
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,098
Under The Doormat.

1483
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,604
I-I Brought It...

1484
01:24:37,606 --> 01:24:39,339
For The Baby.

1485
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:42,176
Money.

1486
01:24:42,178 --> 01:24:44,545
You Give That Back!

1487
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:49,483
Money.

1488
01:24:56,458 --> 01:25:01,562
Geo: Easy.

1489
01:25:01,564 --> 01:25:03,330
You're Okay.

1490
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:11,238
Just Chill.

1491
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:40,367
Ah!

1492
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:45,806
The Lord Is My Shepherd.

1493
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,541
I Shall Not Want.

1494
01:25:47,543 --> 01:25:51,345
He Maketh Me To Lie Down
In Green Pastures.

1495
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:53,247
Oh...

1496
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:56,550
He Leadeth Me
Beside Still Waters.

1497
01:25:56,552 --> 01:25:57,351
He Restores My Soul.

1498
01:25:57,353 --> 01:25:59,286
Shut Up With That
Religious Shit.
Yea, Though I Walk

1499
01:25:59,288 --> 01:26:01,221
Though The Valley
Of The Shadow Of Death...
Geo: Get The Money.

1500
01:26:01,223 --> 01:26:04,892
I Will Fear No Evil,
For You Are--
Where's The Money?

1501
01:26:06,295 --> 01:26:07,227
No.

1502
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:10,264
Angelina:
Thy Rod And Thy Staff,

1503
01:26:10,266 --> 01:26:12,699
They Comfort Me.

1504
01:26:13,635 --> 01:26:15,202
O Lord, Please!

1505
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:23,410
Angelina: Though The Valley
Of The Shadow Of Death.

1506
01:26:23,412 --> 01:26:26,580
Thy Rod And Thy Staff,
They Comfort Me.

1507
01:26:26,582 --> 01:26:29,550
You Prepareth A Table
In The Presence Of My Enemies.

1508
01:26:29,552 --> 01:26:30,217
Stop!!!

1509
01:26:30,219 --> 01:26:32,252
He Anointeth My Head
With Oil.

1510
01:26:32,254 --> 01:26:34,421
Get Geo.
Let's Get Out Of Here.

1511
01:26:34,423 --> 01:26:35,255
Surely Goodness And--

1512
01:26:35,257 --> 01:26:38,392
And Mercy Shall Follow Me
All The Days Of My Life.

1513
01:26:38,394 --> 01:26:39,693
Take It Easy.

1514
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,361
You Don't
Wanna Hurt Anybody.

1515
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:53,507
That Everything?

1516
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:55,943
Pretty Much.

1517
01:26:55,945 --> 01:26:57,744
Okay.

1518
01:26:57,746 --> 01:26:59,213
Then, Um,

1519
01:26:59,215 --> 01:27:00,414
We're Done With You
For Now.

1520
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:03,917
In The Morning, I'll Need You
To Come Down, And, Uh,

1521
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:05,686
Identify The Accused.

1522
01:27:05,688 --> 01:27:06,353
Officer,

1523
01:27:06,355 --> 01:27:08,722
Do You Think We Could
Have Our Costume Money Back?

1524
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:10,390
The Play Is Only
A Few Days Away.

1525
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:12,593
Mmm, Right Now,
It's Still Evidence

1526
01:27:12,595 --> 01:27:14,494
Confiscated At The Scene
Of The Crime.

1527
01:27:14,496 --> 01:27:16,530
I Have To Have That Money.

1528
01:27:16,532 --> 01:27:17,998
Those Kids Are Counting On Me.

1529
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:18,865
I-I Gave Them My Word.

1530
01:27:18,867 --> 01:27:23,003
I'm Sorry.
There's Nothing I Can Do.

1531
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:29,543
So What Made You
Come Tonight?

1532
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:30,677
I Needed To See You.

1533
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:34,715
But When You Weren't Home,
I Figured You
Were At Angelina's.

1534
01:27:34,717 --> 01:27:37,351
After Your Date With Nicole?

1535
01:27:37,353 --> 01:27:38,252
It Wasn't A Date.

1536
01:27:38,254 --> 01:27:41,888
I Mean, I Wish You Would
Just Listen To Me So I Could--

1537
01:27:45,995 --> 01:27:46,693
Let Me Go!

1538
01:27:46,695 --> 01:27:49,930
Give Him The Sedative Now.
Let Me Go! Let Me Go!

1539
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:52,699
<I>Jason: Let Me Go!</I>

1540
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:55,535
Is Jason Gonna
Be All Right?

1541
01:27:55,537 --> 01:27:57,971
The Gunshot Wounds
Were Superficial.

1542
01:27:57,973 --> 01:27:59,273
He Had So Many Drugs
In His System

1543
01:27:59,275 --> 01:28:02,709
That He's Actually Doing Better
Now With The Transfusions

1544
01:28:02,711 --> 01:28:03,777
We've Given Him.

1545
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:04,811
Can You Help Him?

1546
01:28:04,813 --> 01:28:06,446
I Mean, With The Addiction?

1547
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:08,949
We Can Monitor And Assist
With Withdrawal Now.

1548
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:11,885
But Ultimately,
Whether He Stays Clean,

1549
01:28:11,887 --> 01:28:13,587
It's Up To Him.
Right.

1550
01:28:13,589 --> 01:28:15,455
H-How Soon Can He Come Home?

1551
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:16,556
He Could Go To Jail.

1552
01:28:16,558 --> 01:28:17,858
But I Am Recommending

1553
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:20,861
That He Sign Himself
Into A Rehab Center.

1554
01:28:20,863 --> 01:28:21,995
Oh, Thank You So Much.

1555
01:28:21,997 --> 01:28:23,597
No, Jason--Jason--
Oh.

1556
01:28:23,599 --> 01:28:24,831
Is Not Going To Jail.

1557
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:26,066
Hey, Hey,
Hey, Hey, Hey.

1558
01:28:26,068 --> 01:28:28,602
<I>That's Our Son
Lying Back There.</I>

1559
01:28:28,604 --> 01:28:33,073
<I>And That's Our Daughter
That Almost Got Shot.</I>

1560
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:35,375
God!

1561
01:28:35,377 --> 01:28:37,744
Oh, My God.
Oh, Baby.

1562
01:28:37,746 --> 01:28:40,647
Oh, God.

1563
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:43,717
Sharon.

1564
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:49,923
I Haven't Always
Done What's Right In The Past.

1565
01:28:49,925 --> 01:28:51,725
I Know That. But--

1566
01:28:51,727 --> 01:28:52,359
Bill!

1567
01:28:52,361 --> 01:28:55,062
Our Whole World
Is Falling Apart.

1568
01:28:55,064 --> 01:28:55,829
Let Me Finish.

1569
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:59,032
What I Want
To Tell You, Baby--

1570
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:05,806
Nothing In Our Lives

1571
01:29:05,808 --> 01:29:07,941
Has Worked Out
The Way We Wanted.

1572
01:29:07,943 --> 01:29:10,944
But Believe It Or Not,
Baby, I Love You,

1573
01:29:10,946 --> 01:29:13,113
And I Want Our Family
To Work.

1574
01:29:13,115 --> 01:29:16,817
It's Up To Us
To Work Things Out.

1575
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:19,686
Look At Me.

1576
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:27,894
Oh, Oh, Come Here.

1577
01:29:27,896 --> 01:29:29,029
Come Here, Baby.

1578
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:31,898
My Girl.

1579
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,900
Who's My Girl?

1580
01:29:33,902 --> 01:29:34,534
I Am.

1581
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:38,605
I Really Enjoyed Practicing
With You The Other Day.

1582
01:29:39,742 --> 01:29:40,807
Me Too.

1583
01:29:40,809 --> 01:29:43,410
More Than You Know.

1584
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:49,449
I Love You.

1585
01:29:49,451 --> 01:29:50,851
I Love You, Too.

1586
01:29:52,154 --> 01:29:53,487
I'm Caught.

1587
01:29:53,489 --> 01:29:54,621
I'm Caught.
Stand Still.

1588
01:29:54,623 --> 01:29:56,490
Stand Still.
You're Making It Worse.

1589
01:29:56,492 --> 01:29:57,624
Stand Still.
Get It Loose, Bill!

1590
01:29:57,626 --> 01:29:59,526
Baby, You're Gonna Make It--
Get It Loose!

1591
01:29:59,528 --> 01:30:02,662
Why'd You Come
Get Me Anyway, Huh?

1592
01:30:02,664 --> 01:30:07,501
Friends Don't Let Friends
Drive Drunk.

1593
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:15,509
Sharon: You Can Be A Real
Pain In The Butt Sometimes.

1594
01:30:15,511 --> 01:30:17,878
But I Love You, Girl

1595
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,881
I Love You... 
Okay, Sharon--

1596
01:30:20,883 --> 01:30:23,617
Oh, Oh, It's Caught!

1597
01:30:23,619 --> 01:30:24,117
Wait, Sharon--

1598
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:26,920
Sharon: Amanda, Look Out!

1599
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:30,490
Calm Down.

1600
01:30:30,492 --> 01:30:31,792
I'm Here.

1601
01:30:31,794 --> 01:30:33,026
Oh, Baby.

1602
01:30:33,028 --> 01:30:34,561
What Is The Matter?

1603
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:38,732
What Is The Matter?

1604
01:30:38,734 --> 01:30:41,902
I Was Just
Trying To Hug Her.

1605
01:30:43,038 --> 01:30:45,639
All My Fault.

1606
01:30:46,874 --> 01:30:50,110
It Was All My Fault.
No.

1607
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,751
It Was An Accident.

1608
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:00,754
I Forgive You.

1609
01:31:00,756 --> 01:31:04,891
You've Got
To Forgive Yourself.

1610
01:31:05,593 --> 01:31:06,526
Okay?

1611
01:31:06,528 --> 01:31:08,829
I Can't.

1612
01:31:08,831 --> 01:31:10,797
I Loved Her So Much.

1613
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:12,132
Oh, Baby.

1614
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:14,634
We Both Did.

1615
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:18,171
But That Was Another Life.

1616
01:31:19,073 --> 01:31:22,476
You're Not Leaving? Now?

1617
01:31:22,478 --> 01:31:24,110
What About Me?

1618
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:26,980
You're Off To A Good Start.

1619
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:28,548
I Lost The Money
For The Play,

1620
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:31,485
My Best Friend And My Boyfriend
Are Cheating On Me,

1621
01:31:31,487 --> 01:31:33,687
And Angelina And Jason
Are In The Hospital.

1622
01:31:33,689 --> 01:31:36,723
And Now You're Leaving.

1623
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:47,133
See You At The Shelter.

1624
01:31:47,135 --> 01:31:48,902
Won't Be The Same.

1625
01:31:48,904 --> 01:31:49,703
Nothing Ever Is.

1626
01:31:49,705 --> 01:31:53,707
But You've Got 17 Kids
Counting On You.

1627
01:31:55,077 --> 01:31:57,210
I'm Gonna Go
See Angelina Right Now.

1628
01:31:57,212 --> 01:32:00,247
I'll Catch Up
With You Later.

1629
01:32:00,249 --> 01:32:01,515
Mac?

1630
01:32:01,517 --> 01:32:03,984
Will You Check On Jason
For Me?

1631
01:32:03,986 --> 01:32:06,953
Um, Make Sure
That He's Okay?

1632
01:32:06,955 --> 01:32:07,921
If He Needs Anything.

1633
01:32:07,923 --> 01:32:10,023
I'll Do Better Than That.

1634
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:35,048
You Think Visiting Hours
Apply To Chairs?

1635
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:36,182
Where'd You Get That?

1636
01:32:36,184 --> 01:32:39,619
From Your Friends
Down At The Shop.

1637
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:41,888
It's A Piece Of Trash.

1638
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:44,958
No. Like You,
It's A Real Piece Of Work.

1639
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,894
And, Like You,
It's Just Not Finished Yet.

1640
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:52,732
Although, It Looks Considerably
Better Than You At The Moment.

1641
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:55,168
You Think They'll
Let Me Work On It?

1642
01:32:55,170 --> 01:32:56,736
At The Rehab Center?

1643
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:57,637
Sure. They're...

1644
01:32:57,639 --> 01:33:01,074
Bound To Need Better Chairs
Down There.

1645
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,108
So What's Next?

1646
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:03,977
None Of Your Business.

1647
01:33:03,979 --> 01:33:05,345
Who Are You, Anyway?

1648
01:33:05,347 --> 01:33:08,081
A Friend Of Angelina's.

1649
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:09,616
How Is She?

1650
01:33:09,618 --> 01:33:11,217
Nobody Tells Me Anything
Around Here.

1651
01:33:11,219 --> 01:33:13,153
They Treat Me
Like A Criminal.

1652
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:16,022
What's So Funny?

1653
01:33:16,024 --> 01:33:17,724
<I>You Are A Criminal.</I>

1654
01:33:17,726 --> 01:33:19,059
I Did It For Angel.

1655
01:33:19,061 --> 01:33:21,628
So She Could Keep The Baby.

1656
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:23,930
They Didn't Tell You?

1657
01:33:26,167 --> 01:33:28,768
She Lost The Baby.

1658
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:31,871
She Said You Didn't Want It.

1659
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:39,079
Look, Uh...

1660
01:33:39,081 --> 01:33:41,381
Thanks For The Rocker.

1661
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:45,385
Just, Please--
Just Leave Me Alone.

1662
01:33:45,387 --> 01:33:46,987
This Is Between Angel And Me.

1663
01:33:46,989 --> 01:33:48,622
We'll Work It Out.

1664
01:33:48,624 --> 01:33:50,290
Maybe.

1665
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:52,125
Maybe Not.

1666
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:54,995
She Hasn't
Regained Consciousness Yet.

1667
01:33:54,997 --> 01:33:59,099
The Doctors Don't
Expect Her To Make It.

1668
01:34:02,904 --> 01:34:04,304
Please! Wait, Wait, Wait.

1669
01:34:04,306 --> 01:34:05,205
Wait.

1670
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:07,107
Just Please...

1671
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:08,208
Just Help Me.

1672
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:09,242
Help You Do What?

1673
01:34:09,244 --> 01:34:10,710
Just Gotta See Angel.

1674
01:34:10,712 --> 01:34:12,746
And Please Just
Talk To Somebody.

1675
01:34:12,748 --> 01:34:13,780
If You're Really Her Friend,

1676
01:34:13,782 --> 01:34:15,115
You Know She'll Want Me
To Be There.

1677
01:34:15,117 --> 01:34:17,684
She's All Alone.
Just Please Let Me See Her.

1678
01:34:17,686 --> 01:34:20,920
She Doesn't
Need Your Guilt Right Now.

1679
01:34:20,922 --> 01:34:22,722
She Needs Your Love,

1680
01:34:22,724 --> 01:34:25,025
Your Faith,

1681
01:34:25,027 --> 01:34:27,193
And Your Prayers.

1682
01:34:27,195 --> 01:34:28,728
Look...

1683
01:34:28,730 --> 01:34:33,400
I Know That I Am Not
Worth Her Little Finger...

1684
01:34:33,734 --> 01:34:38,004
But She's The Only Person
That I Really Loved.

1685
01:34:40,208 --> 01:34:42,842
She Always Wanted Me
To Say That To Her,

1686
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:44,344
But I Never Did.

1687
01:34:44,346 --> 01:34:46,913
I'll See What I Can Do.

1688
01:34:50,217 --> 01:34:54,988
You Know You Can
Make A Difference
If You're Willing To Change.

1689
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:59,392
The Greatest Man In The Universe
Was A Simple Carpenter.

1690
01:35:00,094 --> 01:35:02,128
And His Life...

1691
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:04,998
Changed This Planet.

1692
01:35:18,913 --> 01:35:21,381
Another Volunteer.

1693
01:35:24,286 --> 01:35:26,352
Hi, I'm Nicki.

1694
01:35:26,354 --> 01:35:27,954
Watch The Sticky Fingers.

1695
01:35:27,956 --> 01:35:30,090
I Got A Heavy Date Tonight.

1696
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:33,193
<I>What Is This Sack
You Are Wearing?</I>

1697
01:35:33,195 --> 01:35:35,295
I'm Mary, The Virgin.

1698
01:35:35,297 --> 01:35:37,197
And This Is My Costume.

1699
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:37,997
Well, No Wonder.

1700
01:35:37,999 --> 01:35:40,467
You're Never Gonna
Get A Guy Looking Like That.

1701
01:35:40,469 --> 01:35:44,738
Hey, Makeovers
Are What I Do.

1702
01:35:45,306 --> 01:35:46,973
Come On.

1703
01:35:51,278 --> 01:35:54,814
I'd Prefer You
Didn't Bring Her Here.

1704
01:35:55,282 --> 01:36:00,053
Has Anyone Ever Told You
How Extremely Irritating
You Can Be?

1705
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:02,789
It Wasn't A Date!

1706
01:36:02,791 --> 01:36:05,959
In Two Weeks, Nicole
Is Going To Have To Testify

1707
01:36:05,961 --> 01:36:09,028
Against Her Own Father
In Court.

1708
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:12,132
What Does That
Have To Do With You?

1709
01:36:17,872 --> 01:36:20,073
My Mom Left Us
When I Was A Kid.

1710
01:36:20,075 --> 01:36:21,341
My Dad Turned Into A Lush.

1711
01:36:21,343 --> 01:36:24,544
I Used To Go By The Bars
After School To Help
Work Off His Bill.

1712
01:36:24,546 --> 01:36:27,914
Nicole Used To Come By
And Pick Up Her Old Man.

1713
01:36:27,916 --> 01:36:32,051
He Was Usually Passed Out
In A Corner Somewhere.

1714
01:36:32,053 --> 01:36:35,054
It Was Kind Of
A Regular Routine.

1715
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:37,924
We Never Really Talked Much.

1716
01:36:38,492 --> 01:36:39,359
Well,

1717
01:36:39,361 --> 01:36:43,229
One Day, My Old Man
Started A Fight.

1718
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:46,332
I Tried Stopping Him
And Ended Up Getting Hammered

1719
01:36:46,334 --> 01:36:49,469
Between Him
And Nicole's Dad.

1720
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:51,337
Bartender Called The Police,

1721
01:36:51,339 --> 01:36:53,506
And All Of Us
Were Hauled Off To Jail.

1722
01:36:53,508 --> 01:36:56,509
Nicole And I
Were Given A Choice.

1723
01:36:56,977 --> 01:36:58,244
Could Go Back Home,

1724
01:36:58,246 --> 01:36:59,379
Or We Could Press Charges

1725
01:36:59,381 --> 01:37:02,382
And Have To Live As A Ward
Of The State.

1726
01:37:02,384 --> 01:37:05,385
Nicole Was Younger,
So She Went Back Home.

1727
01:37:05,387 --> 01:37:07,020
I Left And...

1728
01:37:07,022 --> 01:37:08,354
I Never Looked Back

1729
01:37:08,356 --> 01:37:09,556
When I Was Old Enough,

1730
01:37:09,558 --> 01:37:11,291
I Left The State Home,

1731
01:37:11,293 --> 01:37:14,460
And I've Been
Supporting Myself Ever Since.

1732
01:37:14,462 --> 01:37:16,563
Her Dad Turned
Into A Mean Drunk.

1733
01:37:16,565 --> 01:37:18,965
She's Been Living
On His Unemployment,

1734
01:37:18,967 --> 01:37:20,099
Getting Meals From Guys,

1735
01:37:20,101 --> 01:37:22,001
Shoplifting, Whatever.

1736
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:23,603
Well If It Was That Bad
For Nicole,

1737
01:37:23,605 --> 01:37:26,105
Then Why Did She
Take Me To Bars?

1738
01:37:26,107 --> 01:37:27,240
It's What She Knows.

1739
01:37:27,242 --> 01:37:30,276
It Was Way Better
Than Staying At Home
With Her Old Man.

1740
01:37:30,278 --> 01:37:32,011
Can You Help Her?

1741
01:37:32,013 --> 01:37:34,214
Be Easier If...

1742
01:37:34,216 --> 01:37:37,217
She Had A Few
Friends Around.

1743
01:37:41,223 --> 01:37:43,423
I Will Be.

1744
01:37:43,425 --> 01:37:45,625
Sorry.

1745
01:37:46,461 --> 01:37:51,064
Look, Am I Gonna Have To Fix
All These Costumes By Myself?

1746
01:37:51,066 --> 01:37:52,031
I Mean, Look At Them.

1747
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:54,634
<I>Without Me, You Would
Have No Fashion Sense.</I>

1748
01:37:54,636 --> 01:37:56,135
Zip. Nada.

1749
01:37:56,137 --> 01:37:57,403
I Mean, Really?

1750
01:37:57,405 --> 01:37:59,005
Come On--
Oh--Okay.

1751
01:37:59,007 --> 01:38:00,373
I Get It.

1752
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:01,875
Do You Think You Could Help

1753
01:38:01,877 --> 01:38:03,243
With Makeup, Too?

1754
01:38:03,245 --> 01:38:03,643
Duh.

1755
01:38:03,645 --> 01:38:06,212
And Can We Get, Like,
Little Halos Or Something?

1756
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:10,483
I Mean, You Can't Really
Be An Angel Without Them.

1757
01:38:10,985 --> 01:38:11,918
Don't See Why Not.

1758
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,052
Just Give Me Tin Foil

1759
01:38:13,054 --> 01:38:15,521
<I>And Lots Of Glitter.</I>

1760
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:31,938
I'll Be Right Outside.

1761
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:53,092
I'm So Sorry, Angel.

1762
01:38:58,066 --> 01:39:01,567
I Know--I Know
I Screwed Up Big-Time.

1763
01:39:01,569 --> 01:39:03,603
Yeah.

1764
01:39:03,605 --> 01:39:05,171
Yeah.

1765
01:39:07,641 --> 01:39:10,209
You Never Did Anything

1766
01:39:10,211 --> 01:39:12,178
In Your Entire Life
To Deserve This.

1767
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:15,581
I-I Love You
So Much, Baby.

1768
01:39:21,355 --> 01:39:23,156
I'd Give Anything--

1769
01:39:23,158 --> 01:39:25,992
Anything To Have Things
Back The Way They Were.

1770
01:39:25,994 --> 01:39:27,527
I Would.

1771
01:39:36,337 --> 01:39:39,539
Angel's God...

1772
01:39:45,412 --> 01:39:47,280
I Need To Talk To You.

1773
01:39:47,282 --> 01:39:50,216
I Need To Talk To You.

1774
01:39:54,389 --> 01:39:55,288
She Would--

1775
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:56,990
She Would Always
Talk To You

1776
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:58,591
Like You Were Her Friend.

1777
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:03,029
She Told Me That
She Prayed For Me.

1778
01:40:03,031 --> 01:40:03,429
It--

1779
01:40:03,431 --> 01:40:07,600
It Must've Worked
Because I'm Still Here, Right?

1780
01:40:10,571 --> 01:40:13,473
I Never Prayed For Her.

1781
01:40:13,475 --> 01:40:15,375
Never.

1782
01:40:15,377 --> 01:40:17,577
And I Know That's Wrong...

1783
01:40:17,579 --> 01:40:20,646
On Account That
She's In Real Trouble Now,

1784
01:40:20,648 --> 01:40:22,081
And It's All My Fault.

1785
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:24,283
She Told Me That--

1786
01:40:24,285 --> 01:40:26,152
That Jesus...

1787
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:33,359
Jesus Went To Hell For Me...

1788
01:40:34,461 --> 01:40:35,628
To Pay For What I Did.

1789
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:38,631
To Pay For--

1790
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:43,136
To Pay For What I Did.

1791
01:40:45,606 --> 01:40:50,076
He Must've Been
Tough As Shit, Because...

1792
01:40:51,311 --> 01:40:54,580
I Can't Handle
This Hell I'm In.

1793
01:40:56,350 --> 01:41:00,153
I Understand That, Uh...

1794
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:03,790
That You Rose Yourself
From The Dead.

1795
01:41:03,792 --> 01:41:04,690
I Get It.

1796
01:41:04,692 --> 01:41:06,092
I Believe It. I Do.

1797
01:41:06,094 --> 01:41:07,126
I Believe It.

1798
01:41:07,128 --> 01:41:08,661
Believe It.

1799
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:14,600
So It's Not Like--

1800
01:41:14,602 --> 01:41:20,373
It's Not Like It's A Big Deal
For You To Get Her Out Of This
Coma, Right?

1801
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:23,743
Right?

1802
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:38,091
I Know--

1803
01:41:38,093 --> 01:41:40,626
I Know That I Fucked Up.

1804
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:44,464
She Told Me

1805
01:41:44,466 --> 01:41:47,600
That You Forgive Everybody.

1806
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:51,471
Even Shits Like Me.

1807
01:42:00,247 --> 01:42:04,117
If You Can--
If You Can Do Anything,

1808
01:42:04,119 --> 01:42:06,219
Anything With My Life...

1809
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:10,356
You Can Have It.

1810
01:42:10,757 --> 01:42:12,892
Just, Please,

1811
01:42:12,894 --> 01:42:15,328
Please,

1812
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:17,430
Don't Let Angel Die.

1813
01:42:17,432 --> 01:42:20,299
Don't Let Her Die On Me.

1814
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:28,741
She's My Best Friend.
I'm So Sorry.

1815
01:42:29,309 --> 01:42:30,610
I Love You, Baby.

1816
01:42:30,612 --> 01:42:32,678
I Love You.

1817
01:42:59,873 --> 01:43:02,241
Thank You. All Right.
That's For The Animals.

1818
01:43:02,243 --> 01:43:03,509
Slow Down.
You're Going Too Fast.

1819
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:06,612
Can I Please Have All My Angels
On The Steps Over Here?

1820
01:43:06,614 --> 01:43:08,447
I Forgot What I'm
Supposed To Say.

1821
01:43:08,449 --> 01:43:10,483
Just Remember
Why You Need The Room,

1822
01:43:10,485 --> 01:43:12,518
And You'll
Say The Right Thing.

1823
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:13,352
Hey, Nicole,

1824
01:43:13,354 --> 01:43:15,454
Where's That Glittery
Star You Made?

1825
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,689
I Mean, I've Got A Rig

1826
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:18,658
And A Slot,
But No Star.

1827
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:21,427
Shepherds, Pay Attention.

1828
01:43:21,429 --> 01:43:22,862
When Watching
Over Your Flock At Night,

1829
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:25,531
Do Not--Repeat, Do Not
Step On The Electrical Cords.

1830
01:43:25,533 --> 01:43:28,901
Okay, Here We Go.
And A Five, Six, Seven, Eight.

1831
01:43:28,903 --> 01:43:33,839
Girl: Hey, You Didn't
Say, "And A One, And A Two,
And A Three."

1832
01:43:33,841 --> 01:43:35,708
All Right, I'll Give You
A One And A Two.

1833
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:39,312
Kevin, Stop
Picking Your Nose, Buddy.

1834
01:43:41,449 --> 01:43:42,848
Who's There?

1835
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:43,749
What Do You Want?

1836
01:43:43,751 --> 01:43:47,653
Fear Not.
You're Extremely
Flavored Of The Lord.

1837
01:43:47,655 --> 01:43:48,854
What's That Mean?

1838
01:43:48,856 --> 01:43:51,791
<I>God Loves You,
And He Picked You</I>

1839
01:43:51,793 --> 01:43:53,359
To Be The Mother
Of His Kid.

1840
01:43:53,361 --> 01:43:54,694
You Know, The Son Of God.

1841
01:43:54,696 --> 01:43:56,963
Uh-Uh! I'm A Virgin.

1842
01:43:56,965 --> 01:43:59,265
Uh-Huh.
So What Do I Do?

1843
01:43:59,267 --> 01:44:02,535
Nothing. God Will
Take Care Of Everything,

1844
01:44:02,537 --> 01:44:05,271
Including Talking To Joseph
About It.

1845
01:44:05,273 --> 01:44:08,341
Okay. If You Say So.

1846
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:11,344
Hey, Joe, Wake Up.

1847
01:44:11,346 --> 01:44:13,813
Mary's With Child.
Say What?

1848
01:44:13,815 --> 01:44:14,747
She's Pregnant.

1849
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:16,649
<I>I Didn't Do Anything.</I>

1850
01:44:16,651 --> 01:44:17,750
We Know, We Know.

1851
01:44:17,752 --> 01:44:18,851
She Really Is A Virgin.

1852
01:44:18,853 --> 01:44:20,753
<I>What Do You
Want Meto Do?</I>

1853
01:44:20,755 --> 01:44:22,288
First, Marry Her.

1854
01:44:22,290 --> 01:44:23,389
But Don't Touch Her.

1855
01:44:23,391 --> 01:44:26,859
Then, Name The Baby Jesus.

1856
01:44:26,861 --> 01:44:27,627
Anything Else?

1857
01:44:27,629 --> 01:44:28,928
Yeah, Take Good Care
Of Them.

1858
01:44:28,930 --> 01:44:31,697
I'll Be Bringing
More Instructions Later.

1859
01:44:31,699 --> 01:44:37,637
<I>Kevin: Caesar Was Disgusted
And Sent Everyone Home
To Be Taxed.</I>

1860
01:44:37,639 --> 01:44:39,305
My Wife's Having A Baby.

1861
01:44:39,307 --> 01:44:40,506
<I>Let Me It.
Child: No!</I>

1862
01:44:40,508 --> 01:44:44,277
You're Supposed To Say,
"There's No Room At The Inn!"

1863
01:44:44,279 --> 01:44:45,845
<I>I Said "No," Didn't I?</I>

1864
01:44:45,847 --> 01:44:46,712
What Do We Do?

1865
01:44:46,714 --> 01:44:50,783
<I>You Can Sleep
In The Barn If You Want.
Thanks.</I>

1866
01:44:57,424 --> 01:44:59,325
The Star Stopped.

1867
01:44:59,327 --> 01:45:01,661
Look! There's The Castle
Over There.

1868
01:45:01,663 --> 01:45:06,365
Well, The Lights Are On.
So They Must Still Be Up.

1869
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:12,571
Boy: Hi, We're Very Wise Men.

1870
01:45:12,573 --> 01:45:14,907
<I>And Wise Woman.
I'm Horrid.</I>

1871
01:45:14,909 --> 01:45:18,611
We've Been Following His Star
For A Very Long Time.

1872
01:45:18,613 --> 01:45:20,079
Then You Must Be Hungry.

1873
01:45:20,081 --> 01:45:21,314
Come Enjoy Some Twinkies

1874
01:45:21,316 --> 01:45:25,017
While I Check It Out
With My Wise Guys.

1875
01:45:29,423 --> 01:45:32,391
<I>My Boys Say If It's True,</I>

1876
01:45:32,393 --> 01:45:34,960
He's Supposed To Be Born
In Bethlehem.

1877
01:45:34,962 --> 01:45:36,329
Boy: Where's That?

1878
01:45:36,331 --> 01:45:37,096
Not Too Far From Here.

1879
01:45:37,098 --> 01:45:38,964
I'll Show You On My G.P.S.

1880
01:45:38,966 --> 01:45:40,599
Thanks.

1881
01:45:40,601 --> 01:45:41,701
Just A Minute.

1882
01:45:41,703 --> 01:45:43,502
You Owe Me Now.

1883
01:45:43,504 --> 01:45:46,439
So When You Find Out
Where He Is, You Let Me Know.

1884
01:45:46,441 --> 01:45:48,708
<I>Do You Want
To Worship Him, Too?</I>

1885
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:50,443
Yeah. Me And The Boys

1886
01:45:50,445 --> 01:45:53,913
Are Gonna Pay Him
A Little Visit.

1887
01:46:08,995 --> 01:46:11,497
Hey, How Your Sheep Doing?

1888
01:46:11,499 --> 01:46:13,499
They're Okay.

1889
01:46:13,501 --> 01:46:14,133
But I'm Bored.

1890
01:46:14,135 --> 01:46:16,635
<I>Nothing Ever Happens
In Bethlehem.</I>

1891
01:46:16,637 --> 01:46:20,873
When I'm Old Enough,
I'm Going To Jerusalem,

1892
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:21,941
Be A Tax Collector.

1893
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:27,446
Hark! Herald Angels
Are Singing!

1894
01:46:51,072 --> 01:46:51,771
Fear Not.

1895
01:46:51,773 --> 01:46:54,106
Behold, I Bring You
Good Tidings

1896
01:46:54,108 --> 01:46:56,575
Of Great Joy
Which Shall Be

1897
01:46:56,577 --> 01:46:57,777
To All People.

1898
01:46:57,779 --> 01:46:59,678
Which Means?

1899
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:00,746
Good News For Everybody.

1900
01:47:00,748 --> 01:47:04,750
Unto You Is Born,
This Day, In The City Of David,

1901
01:47:04,752 --> 01:47:08,454
A Savior,
Which Is Christ The Lord.

1902
01:47:08,456 --> 01:47:09,655
This Shall Be A Sign To You:

1903
01:47:09,657 --> 01:47:13,125
You Shall Find A Babe
Wrapped In Swaddling Clothes,

1904
01:47:13,127 --> 01:47:14,460
Lying In A Manger.

1905
01:47:14,462 --> 01:47:16,796
What Are Swaddling Clothes?

1906
01:47:16,798 --> 01:47:18,597
Kevin: Pampers, Dummy.

1907
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:20,666
Let's Check It Out.

1908
01:47:20,668 --> 01:47:23,102
What About Our Sheep?

1909
01:47:23,104 --> 01:47:24,970
Bring 'Em With.

1910
01:47:26,574 --> 01:47:28,607
Glory To God In The Highest.

1911
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:30,509
And On Earth, Peace.

1912
01:47:30,511 --> 01:47:32,645
Goodwill To All Men.

1913
01:47:52,633 --> 01:47:54,133
We, Uh, Took Up A Collection
At The Station,

1914
01:47:54,135 --> 01:47:59,138
And Thought Maybe You
Could Use This To Buy
Some Presents For The Kids.

1915
01:50:16,743 --> 01:50:19,078
I Love You, Ashley.

1916
01:50:19,245 --> 01:50:21,146
I Love You, Too, Jonathan.

1917
01:50:28,622 --> 01:50:30,856
So This Is Christmas.
