1
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:25,450
<i>In his infinite wisdom,
the Lord has summoned Corrine...</i>

2
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:30,853
<i>to join Him and her loving parents
in the Kingdom of Heaven.</i>

3
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:38,093
<i>Loving wife of Troy,
loyal friend to all who knew her.</i>

4
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:41,496
She is now amongst the angels...

5
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:47,407
sitting at His side.

6
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:07,121
-Amen.
-Amen.

7
00:01:08,128 --> 00:01:12,325
<i>Your support means so much
in this time of grief and sorrow.</i>

8
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:17,092
Joyce and Troy invite you to
the house for further reflection...

9
00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:19,196
and a little nosh.

10
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:15,657
I got rid of the couch.

11
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:43,346
You are so strong.

12
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:48,449
Just like at your father's service.
You didn't cry then either.

13
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:51,360
I was two.

14
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:55,261
Well, children are keenly
aware of death.

15
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:58,957
You were my own little
John-John Kennedy.

16
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,076
-What is she doing here?
-Who?

17
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:16,076
Your aunt.

18
00:03:19,021 --> 00:03:22,889
Troy. Please!
She'll ruin everything.

19
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:26,893
How do you ruin a funeral?

20
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:34,635
I wasn't sure whether or not
you were coming.

21
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:37,897
Of course. I loved that girl.

22
00:03:38,107 --> 00:03:39,335
Just didn't wanna waste
such a beautiful day...

23
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,702
listening to a bunch
of medieval mumbo-jumbo.

24
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,470
Actually, you know,
the service was pretty nice.

25
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,582
Please! The last time you two were
in church was the day you got married.

26
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:50,718
And you only did that
to appease Morticia.

27
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:52,010
Hilda.

28
00:03:53,454 --> 00:03:56,719
-What are you doing?
-I'm planting a testimonial.

29
00:03:57,024 --> 00:04:01,021
-It's a cactus.
-They were all out of eternal flames.

30
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:07,825
Troy, I'm very overwhelmed
right now.

31
00:04:08,603 --> 00:04:11,868
I will see you inside in a minute.
Let me...

32
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:22,945
When isn't she very overwhelmed?

33
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,211
Come on inside...

34
00:04:25,886 --> 00:04:27,615
when you're finished.

35
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:42,362
Just remember, Troy:
peace I leave with you.

36
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:46,336
Let not your heart be troubled.

37
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:51,835
So said John.

38
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:06,523
John who?

39
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,457
Bible John.

40
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:13,130
Right. Yeah. He was cool.

41
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:18,459
So, how're you doing?

42
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:21,364
-I'm okay.
-Good.

43
00:05:21,574 --> 00:05:24,543
Good. Good.

44
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:33,606
So listen, I was thinking.
We should take a trip. Maybe Vegas.

45
00:05:34,152 --> 00:05:35,744
We've been talking
about going since college.

46
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:38,582
-No, man. I need to work.
-Come on, man. Just for the weekend.

47
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,258
It, it's good to take a trip
after a loss.

48
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:46,329
So what are you supposed
to do after a win?

49
00:05:56,808 --> 00:05:58,537
So this is dreary.

50
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:03,512
-Anybody have a good story?
-Story about what?

51
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:07,480
We're supposed to be celebrating
Corrine, aren't we?

52
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:15,787
Hello! Everybody, hello?
Hi.

53
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:19,154
I'd like to say some stuff
about Corrine.

54
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:21,657
About a year ago,
she came out for a visit and...

55
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:24,163
I took her out to my clinic
on the reservation.

56
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:27,030
And there was this
little girl there, Olivia...

57
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,738
who had terrible stomach cramps.

58
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,103
And she was so shy
that I couldn't, you know...

59
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,902
get her to explain to me
really what was going on.

60
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:39,047
I couldn't get a sense of it.
So Corrine sat with her.

61
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:42,775
And suddenly
I hear this gigantic burp.

62
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:44,950
Corrine.

63
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,855
And then she burped again.
And then Olivia burped.

64
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:52,391
And then they were going back
and forth like a couple of sailors!

65
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:54,658
And problem solved.

66
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:57,631
If you've got a belly full of gas,
it's gotta go somewhere, right?

67
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,233
I'll never forget it. I mean...

68
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,802
Corrine was so special.

69
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:07,333
Excuse me.

70
00:07:07,642 --> 00:07:10,304
I've been trying to for years.

71
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:13,239
-Troy, you remember the Tollivers?
-Certainly.

72
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:15,780
-We met at the viewing.
-Barbaric ritual.

73
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:17,076
I thought she never
looked more lovely.

74
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:19,276
Of course she did.
I mean, she was alive.

75
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:23,121
Hilda!
When you are in my house...

76
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:25,885
you will treat the dead
with proper respect.

77
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:31,464
You know, I've never met anyone
who was so happy being so miserable.

78
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:35,168
-Walk me out?
-Yeah.

79
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:39,502
Just wait a second.

80
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:46,605
I thought the viewing was nice.

81
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:53,312
You know, you really should get away
from all this sanctimonious bullshit.

82
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,045
Give yourself some room to breathe.

83
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,591
My desert's beautiful
this time of year.

84
00:08:00,094 --> 00:08:02,085
I'll think about it.

85
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:05,288
-Can't ask for more than that.
-Nope.

86
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:10,728
She wanted me to give this to you.

87
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:23,408
Okay.

88
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:14,859
Troy.

89
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,300
Troy!

90
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:19,093
Mr. Hutchinson. Hi.

91
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:23,296
Well, I was just wondering
how you were feeling.

92
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:27,071
Thank you, sir.
I'm gonna be okay.

93
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:30,113
Maybe you would like
to take a few days off.

94
00:09:30,314 --> 00:09:33,806
-You know, too rest.
-No, really, sir. I'm okay.

95
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:38,682
I actually feel really good just,
you know, being back at work.

96
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:44,020
There's nothing like good, hard work
to take a man's mind off his troubles.

97
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:48,921
So, how is the Boyle project
coming along?

98
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:51,293
Well, sir, yeah.
Very, very well.

99
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:55,460
Well, it's crunch-time on that one.
We present in a week, so...

100
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:09,976
Alright.
So where are we going to lunch?

101
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:13,519
You're going to lunch.
I'm staying here.

102
00:10:13,723 --> 00:10:15,918
Come on, sushi place down the street.
I'll buy the sake.

103
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,558
No, man. I'm not hungry.
Thank you.

104
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,249
You're gonna make me beg,
aren't ya?

105
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:21,224
Alright, fine.
Look, there's a cute waitress there.

106
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,920
I can't do it by myself.
You know how I get.

107
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:25,622
Well, I think you're probably
gonna be okay by yourself.

108
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,699
But I got like a week on this thing
and I don't...

109
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:29,734
-You're not gonna eat for a week?
-Not what I said.

110
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:31,997
Didn't say I wasn't gonna eat
for a week. I'm not feeling hungry.

111
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:35,005
Willy, I said no.
Okay? I said no.

112
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:42,841
I'm gonna...

113
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:46,612
-Alright, Mexican. There's a cute...
-Can you give me a break on this one?

114
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:49,984
I'm not hungry, I got work to do.
I don't...

115
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,385
Alright.

116
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:55,528
I don't eat Mexican...

117
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:58,960
food.

118
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:10,810
Fine.

119
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:18,001
Hey, honey, I'm home.

120
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:21,175
I hope you're hungry 'cause
I am in the mood to cook.

121
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,109
And no, you can't help.

122
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:25,545
I'm gonna make that salmon thing
we had at that restaurant...

123
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:27,684
near the place where
we almost bought the puppy.

124
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,250
You know, I never told you this,
but I...

125
00:12:29,454 --> 00:12:31,718
almost went back the next day
and bought it anyway.

126
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:34,448
I know they trash the house
and pee on everything...

127
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:37,594
but it'd be good practice
for when we decide to have...

128
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:44,332
Why so glum?

129
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:49,196
We will have none of that
in my house.

130
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,446
Besides, whatever it is,
it's nothing that can't be fixed...

131
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:06,850
by a long, hot bath
with your favorite wife.

132
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,999
I'll wash your front.

133
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:25,656
<i>"My love</i>.

134
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,391
<i>Right now you're sleeping</i>
<i>beside me</i>...

135
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:31,504
<i>in a torturous hospital chair</i>
<i>drooling adorably down your shirt</i>.

136
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:33,765
<i>Since you insist</i>
<i>on denying the inevitable</i>...

137
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:37,068
<i>I decided to write this foryou</i>
<i>for after I'm gone</i>.

138
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:40,110
<i>I hate to say I told you so, but</i>...

139
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:44,440
<i>First, you need to know</i>
<i>how happy I was with you</i>.

140
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:49,384
<i>You made me feel safe and loved</i>
<i>and special and invincible</i>.

141
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,855
<i>And that thing you did with</i>
<i>marmalade wasn't so bad either</i>.

142
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,461
<i>You were my love at first sight</i>
<i>and I will love you forever</i>.

143
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,652
<i>I need you to do something for me</i>.
<i>My last request, as it were</i>.

144
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,585
<i>Go out to Hilda's</i>
<i>and build her a porch</i>.

145
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,550
<i>I know it sounds weird</i>,
<i>but I promised her we'd do it</i>...

146
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,456
<i>a long time ago and we never did</i>.

147
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,099
<i>Besides, you two have a lot more</i>
<i>in common than you realize</i>.

148
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,459
<i>Especially now</i>.

149
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,061
<i>Who knows? Maybe you'll even</i>
<i>figure out how to uncross the stars</i>.

150
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,070
<i>I nevercould</i>.

151
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:47,908
<i>I love you for always and ever</i>.
<i>Corrine."</i>

152
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:04,919
-I'm sorry.
-Excuse me.

153
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,928
-No, here.
-Thank you.

154
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:27,707
Top'er off?

155
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:35,387
-How was the pot pie?
-It's fine. Thank you.

156
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:39,792
Could you tell me how far away
Happy Valley is?

157
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:42,124
About 150 miles.

158
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:43,890
Somebody die?

159
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:46,228
Excuse me?

160
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:49,937
Only time young people go out to Happy
Valley is when somebody's dead.

161
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:51,567
Nobody died.

162
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:55,507
Can't get any reception here.
Is there a pay phone?

163
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:58,203
Sure. Out by the jerky.

164
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:00,405
Thank you.

165
00:17:02,952 --> 00:17:05,512
Oh, my. My, my, my.

166
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:38,144
You okay?

167
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,388
Oh, my God!

168
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:43,057
-Let me get you a doctor...
-No! Just help me.

169
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:47,361
Oh, my God.

170
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:52,394
Okay.

171
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,227
What do you want me to do?

172
00:17:54,435 --> 00:17:56,027
What do you want me to do?

173
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:58,728
-I don't know!
-Okay, okay, okay.

174
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:01,772
All right, well,
you just breathe, okay?

175
00:18:01,976 --> 00:18:04,001
Oh, my God.

176
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:08,340
Oh, my God!
You are really doing this.

177
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:12,849
You really are doing this.
Okay. Okay.

178
00:18:13,054 --> 00:18:16,956
Look at me.
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

179
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:19,456
That's it.
Okay, give me my hand.

180
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,991
That's it. Oh, my God!

181
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,123
We have a head!

182
00:18:26,332 --> 00:18:28,527
Okay. Okay.
Look at me. Look at me.

183
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,669
Give me a push.
Give me a push.

184
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,566
That's it. Okay.
That's it. One more.

185
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:34,831
That's it.

186
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:37,771
Oh, my God!

187
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:46,411
It's unbelievable!

188
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:54,687
Oh, my God.

189
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:57,161
It's a little girl.

190
00:18:57,362 --> 00:19:00,126
Oh, my God.

191
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:03,093
Oh, my God.
It's a little girl.

192
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,329
Oh, man.

193
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:13,311
-She's a little girl.
-Is there a problem?

194
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:16,138
It's a girl.

195
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:18,808
What do you know about that!

196
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:23,383
Thank you.
You did so good.

197
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:26,820
You did good.
Real good.

198
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:28,423
Son, you gonna let us
get outta here?

199
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,789
That kid's gonna be talking
before I can get her to a doctor.

200
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,554
Bye-bye.

201
00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:32,580
-Who is it?
-Hey, it's me.

202
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:34,813
-Who's me?
-I'm sorry. It's Troy.

203
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:36,548
Troy!

204
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:39,060
Hi, I'm sorry. I tried calling you
a couple of times...

205
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:40,660
but you don't have a machine, so...

206
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:44,299
Oh, yeah. Usually if it's important
they call back or they just show up.

207
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,728
-Where's your stuff?
-It's all in the car.

208
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:47,334
You know, I'll get it later.

209
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:49,333
You know, I thought
about what you said...

210
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:50,766
about getting away and everything.

211
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:53,635
Stop shoveling.
It was Corrine's letter.

212
00:20:53,843 --> 00:20:56,903
Don't worry. I don't take things
as personally as most people.

213
00:20:57,112 --> 00:20:58,477
Did you read the letter?

214
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:01,609
She wrote it to you.

215
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:05,809
This is the guest room and...
clean towels in the closet.

216
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,545
My God. You're never gonna guess
what happened to me on the way here.

217
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:10,012
I might.

218
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:12,693
Let me sleep on it.
Good night.

219
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:22,646
Excuse me.

220
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,047
You know where the pool is?

221
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,624
Excuse me.

222
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:37,229
Do you know where the pool is?

223
00:23:37,434 --> 00:23:39,959
I'm not deaf, son.
I just wasn't paying any attention.

224
00:23:40,204 --> 00:23:41,262
I'm sorry, man, I...

225
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:45,168
Better to keep your mouth shut
and look stupid...

226
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:48,968
than open it and remove all doubt.

227
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:52,612
Okay. I'm supposed to meet
my aunt at the pool.

228
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:54,616
Who's your aunt?

229
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:58,216
Hilda Limberlost.

230
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:06,285
Robert. Walden.
Call me Bobby.

231
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:08,154
-I'm Troy Harper.
-The nephew.

232
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,559
Yeah. I came out here
to build my aunt a porch.

233
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:12,860
Corrine come with you?

234
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,135
I met her the last time
she was out here.

235
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:18,465
Sharp girl. I always wanted
to meet the guy she picked.

236
00:24:18,673 --> 00:24:20,038
She died.

237
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:29,207
I'm truly sorry to hear that.

238
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,413
Yeah, me too.

239
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,079
I'm sorry.
Where did you say the pool was?

240
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:39,189
I didn't.

241
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:44,323
It's up the street to the right.

242
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:50,969
Yeah, they're doing their
morning water works thing.

243
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,098
Thank you.

244
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,979
Okay, jumping jacks!
Come on, all together!

245
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:36,079
You can do it.

246
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:40,378
Okay. Let's do the resistance.
Forward and back.

247
00:25:40,587 --> 00:25:44,956
Do you feel it? Yes.
It gets to the triceps.

248
00:25:45,158 --> 00:25:48,650
Forward and back.

249
00:25:49,996 --> 00:25:51,429
Hey, Hilda, this him?

250
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:55,066
Hey, everybody.
This is my nephew, Troy.

251
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:57,758
Hi, Troy!

252
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,959
Hi.

253
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:01,332
He's so handsome!

254
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:03,472
Even more than his pictures.

255
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:05,809
-So what are you doing?
-Water aerobics.

256
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:07,678
It keeps the muscles toned.

257
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,008
And it's good for the digestion, too.
Come on in.

258
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:12,513
Norma!

259
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:16,085
He doesn't wanna get in a pool
with a bunch of old ladies.

260
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:19,314
How do you know?
Maybe that's his thing.

261
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:21,156
I don't have a suit.

262
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,260
Skinny dip.
I will if you will.

263
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:25,451
Norma!

264
00:26:26,197 --> 00:26:30,156
Well, it isn't like it's something
that every one of us hasn't seen.

265
00:26:30,368 --> 00:26:33,201
-Except maybe you.
-Perhaps another time.

266
00:26:33,404 --> 00:26:34,962
We're here every morning.

267
00:26:35,306 --> 00:26:38,036
Hilda, I just came to tell you,
I'm gonna get started on the porch.

268
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:39,433
What porch?

269
00:26:39,644 --> 00:26:40,633
You don't remember?

270
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:43,109
My wife promised you
she was gonna build you a porch.

271
00:26:43,314 --> 00:26:46,841
That'll be nice.
Okay, see you later.

272
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:52,622
Bye.

273
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:54,552
See you later!

274
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:05,201
Do you feel resistance?
Doesn't that feel good?

275
00:27:05,402 --> 00:27:06,801
-No.
-Yes, it does.

276
00:27:14,444 --> 00:27:16,435
A little unwieldy?

277
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:19,805
Supplies for the deck?

278
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:23,716
Yeah. The porch.

279
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:30,654
Hang on a second, will you?

280
00:27:33,596 --> 00:27:36,064
Man, hardware stores, huh?

281
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:41,164
You gonna be okay here?

282
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,531
You know, I remember
when I was a kid.

283
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:45,434
A hardware store?

284
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:49,008
I mean, it was this magical place
your dad took you to, you know?

285
00:27:49,211 --> 00:27:51,042
It was kind of like the ballpark.

286
00:27:51,247 --> 00:27:52,407
You'd spend hours and hours
in there...

287
00:27:52,615 --> 00:27:55,914
just learning every tool
on the God's green Earth.

288
00:27:56,118 --> 00:27:58,143
-This you?
-Yeah.

289
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:01,088
Now you spend hours in there...

290
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:03,780
just trying to find somebody
who can help you.

291
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:07,723
And you finally find a live one,
they don't know the difference...

292
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:10,864
between an Allen wrench
and Allen frickin' Ginsberg.

293
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,464
That would have hurt, dude.

294
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:16,398
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

295
00:28:16,604 --> 00:28:20,233
You wanna grab it in the center.
Use your hip for leverage.

296
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:22,909
And then just swing, baby.

297
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,975
I don't know if you realize this,
but a porch is a pretty big project.

298
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:34,449
-I'd be glad to help you out.
-I'm fine.

299
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:37,588
Oh, well. Suit yourself.

300
00:28:38,692 --> 00:28:40,284
You know, it's a shame, really.

301
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:43,588
A person's death is more
the survivor's affair than their own.

302
00:28:47,968 --> 00:28:52,029
Well, I got succulents to over-feed.

303
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:56,907
Hey, Troy!

304
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,978
Just remember:
takes a big man to cry.

305
00:29:04,151 --> 00:29:06,983
And even a bigger one
to laugh at him.

306
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:35,103
Corrine took one of those
home with her.

307
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:37,830
Had a hell of a time
getting it in the car.

308
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:40,771
Yeah. I had a hell of a time
getting it in the house.

309
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:44,242
-Here.
-Thank you.

310
00:30:45,515 --> 00:30:46,846
So, how're you doing?

311
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:49,643
Well, I think I'm gonna be finished
digging the footings...

312
00:30:49,852 --> 00:30:53,015
No, that's not
what I'm talking about.

313
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,789
I'm fine.

314
00:30:59,195 --> 00:31:00,685
Fine.

315
00:31:02,665 --> 00:31:04,064
Yeah.

316
00:31:07,203 --> 00:31:11,299
Well, if it ever comes up,
I'm pretty good at listening.

317
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:14,841
Okay.

318
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,839
I better go get changed.

319
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,574
The girls are coming over
for Bingo tonight.

320
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:28,522
Relax. You don't have to come.

321
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:46,501
Looks like the cat
had another busy day.

322
00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:51,474
That's Juvie. Juventus.
For the Roman goddess of youth.

323
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:53,540
You must have had her a long time.

324
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:57,547
Don't bury her yet. Put that feline
within ten feet of a lizard...

325
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:00,481
she'll make you a belt and a handbag
before you can say Christmas.

326
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:04,191
I didn't know you had a tattoo.

327
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,894
Yeah. I got it a long time ago.
Thought it was cool.

328
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:12,395
Turns out it was dumb.

329
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:16,298
Did you see the sunflower
at the front door this morning?

330
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:21,706
Oh, yeah. I called the shop.
They delivered it by mistake.

331
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:37,951
Some of the girls are allergic.

332
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:42,020
Hello, hello!

333
00:32:45,565 --> 00:32:48,466
Troy, meet the poster girls
at Happy Valley.

334
00:32:48,668 --> 00:32:52,501
Tina Kazawa and
Agnes Clearborn Delta Mercer.

335
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:58,241
Your auntie just likes to hear
herself talk. You call me Lulu.

336
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,842
This is for you.

337
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:00,943
We signed it.

338
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:04,775
So when we're big-time models,
you can sell it for a lot of money.

339
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:06,779
When I moved here...

340
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,751
the broker said this was
a culturally diverse community.

341
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:15,950
Turns out, Tina and I
are as diverse as it gets.

342
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:20,096
So they use us in all the brochures.
We are bait.

343
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,832
Hello, everyone!
Sorry we're late.

344
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,697
Where's the boy?

345
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,202
This is Norma Augenot
and Phyllis Watt.

346
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:35,134
Now, you are Russian
before you go to the bathroom.

347
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,476
You are American
when you come out of the bathroom.

348
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,550
What are you
when you're in the bathroom?

349
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,450
European!

350
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,854
Let me look at you.

351
00:33:48,392 --> 00:33:51,122
You are so handsome!

352
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,093
I'll tell you. If you were just
a few years younger...

353
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:58,165
we could leave these old farts
and go paint the town!

354
00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:03,002
Norma, this is Happy Valley.
There's nothing to paint.

355
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:07,341
Phyllis!

356
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:10,780
Your hearing aids. Fix'em!

357
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:13,512
Pardon me. Sorry.

358
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,714
Can you believe this?

359
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:17,887
That sound could kill mice,
but she can't even hear it.

360
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:21,649
If you wouldn't call attention to it,
no one would even notice.

361
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:25,419
Then why is everybody's
ears bleeding?

362
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:27,855
That sound goes off
in the middle of the night.

363
00:34:28,063 --> 00:34:30,531
It scares the pee out of me.

364
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:33,827
I'm gonna have to start
wearing those adult diapers.

365
00:34:34,503 --> 00:34:35,868
Norma!

366
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:38,403
I take it that you two live together.

367
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:39,505
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

368
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:44,475
We have to. I can't see worth
a damn. She can't hear.

369
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,582
But together,
we have all the senses covered.

370
00:34:48,784 --> 00:34:50,911
Except maybe common.

371
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:56,990
Hilda, you could at least
invite another man...

372
00:34:57,192 --> 00:34:59,716
so Troy wouldn't feel
so out-numbered.

373
00:34:59,927 --> 00:35:03,954
-I know one who'd gladly come.
-Troy's not coming with us tonight.

374
00:35:04,165 --> 00:35:06,224
No. I got a big project for work.

375
00:35:06,434 --> 00:35:10,632
But Bingo's fun! And you can win
all sorts of great prizes.

376
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:14,205
Why, just last week,
Norma won a food dehydrator.

377
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:16,570
I was going for the dildo.

378
00:35:17,045 --> 00:35:18,569
-Norma!
-Well.

379
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,978
-It was a personal massager.
-According to you.

380
00:35:23,217 --> 00:35:26,186
While he's with us, he doesn't have
to do anything he doesn't wanna do.

381
00:35:26,387 --> 00:35:29,788
Why don't you come to dinner with us
tomorrow night at the Cow House?

382
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,185
Yeah, sure.
That sounds great.

383
00:35:36,396 --> 00:35:40,628
You'll love it! Best Mexican food
south of Vancouver.

384
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:42,366
And the best music.

385
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:46,164
I hope you like to dance
as much as your wife did.

386
00:35:46,373 --> 00:35:49,467
-God rest her.
-We took her when she was here.

387
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:52,577
She made the mistake of dancing
with some old man.

388
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:56,647
Every old geezer in the joint
had her out on the floor.

389
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,613
It's true. It's true.

390
00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:00,343
-They still talk about it.
-I thought it was funny.

391
00:36:00,554 --> 00:36:02,181
-Bingo anyone?
-Mildred!

392
00:36:02,556 --> 00:36:04,648
Well, what's with that get-up?

393
00:36:04,857 --> 00:36:06,119
Well, I think I haven't
been winning...

394
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:08,885
because I haven't been taking
the game seriously enough.

395
00:36:09,095 --> 00:36:10,426
These are for you.

396
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:14,023
I baked homemade this morning,
but they didn't make it.

397
00:36:14,233 --> 00:36:16,064
So, are we going
or should I sit down?

398
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:19,328
-If I sit, we'll be here awhile.
-Let's go.

399
00:36:19,538 --> 00:36:20,869
I wanna get a good seat.

400
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:23,769
Troy's going to the Cow House
with us tomorrow night.

401
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:25,375
Wonderful!

402
00:36:25,578 --> 00:36:28,069
Be sure and save me a rumba.

403
00:36:29,048 --> 00:36:30,811
Oh, Troy.

404
00:36:31,383 --> 00:36:36,479
What makes fifty blue-haired old
ladies all say shit at the same time?

405
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:41,755
Have the fifty-first say Bingo.

406
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:07,007
-Are you drinking a lot of water?
-My God!

407
00:37:07,218 --> 00:37:10,243
'Cause you know you can sweat off
like a quart an hour in this heat.

408
00:37:11,588 --> 00:37:13,317
Yeah, I'll be okay. Thank you.

409
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:16,759
I brought you my screw gun.

410
00:37:17,394 --> 00:37:20,158
Kill yourself trying to do
this whole thing with a hammer.

411
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:21,353
I'm pretty good with a hammer.

412
00:37:21,565 --> 00:37:25,126
I'm just saying, man, I just don't
wanna see you hurt yourself or nothin'.

413
00:37:26,136 --> 00:37:30,038
Well, I'll be fine. Thanks.

414
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,703
Boy, your aunt must be pretty stoked,
get herself a new deck, huh?

415
00:37:33,911 --> 00:37:37,540
Porch. Yeah. I guess so.

416
00:37:37,748 --> 00:37:39,875
So how's she doing?
I don't see her at all anymore.

417
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:42,710
-What, she rejoin the Peace Corps?
-She's fine.

418
00:37:47,924 --> 00:37:52,327
Well, good. Good.

419
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:10,044
-We have to get going soon.
-Where?

420
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,679
The Cow House, remember?

421
00:38:13,548 --> 00:38:16,142
Yeah, do you mind if I take
a rain check on that?

422
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:18,410
We don't have much rain around here.

423
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,554
Look, I got a whole lot of work
to do tonight.

424
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:22,723
Yeah, the girls are all excited
to see you.

425
00:38:23,024 --> 00:38:24,321
I understand that.

426
00:38:24,526 --> 00:38:27,290
Well, nobody asked you
to give your word.

427
00:38:27,495 --> 00:38:30,020
I'm just asking you to keep it.

428
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:40,036
-Hey, Dawn, remember this one?
-I love this one, Don.

429
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:43,075
-Why don't we sing it for them, baby?
-Let's do it.

430
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:46,210
<i>When I'm alone</i>

431
00:38:46,413 --> 00:38:50,907
<i>Feels like my darkest day</i>

432
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,645
<i>When you come home</i>

433
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:05,327
Here, Troy. Try this.

434
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:07,564
Cactus jelly. It's delicious.

435
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:10,430
Only if you like eating
Vicks Vapor Rub.

436
00:39:15,175 --> 00:39:16,437
Hot stuff.

437
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:40,394
Oh, my God.

438
00:39:44,604 --> 00:39:47,334
This should get you started, ladies!

439
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:53,466
Here we go. Pass'em out.

440
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:55,874
Who is the handsome gentleman?

441
00:39:56,181 --> 00:39:57,648
My nephew, Troy.

442
00:39:57,849 --> 00:40:00,079
-The husband from Corrine?
-Yeah.

443
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:05,149
Oh, you are a lucky man.
She is a wonderful lady. Wonderful!

444
00:40:05,357 --> 00:40:08,417
She broke all the old men's hearts
when she was here.

445
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,558
Be careful, Troy.

446
00:40:09,761 --> 00:40:12,696
These ladies can really
put down some margaritas.

447
00:40:12,898 --> 00:40:14,798
I'd like to make a toast.

448
00:40:16,201 --> 00:40:18,669
First, to Troy's porch.
Long may it stand.

449
00:40:21,073 --> 00:40:23,666
And... and to Corrine.

450
00:40:24,342 --> 00:40:25,775
I miss her smile.

451
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:34,651
I know it hurts now.
And that may never pass.

452
00:40:34,986 --> 00:40:39,980
But one day you'll wake up
and you'll be all right.

453
00:40:43,828 --> 00:40:45,261
I promise.

454
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,760
Thank you. Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen. Thank you!

455
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:51,196
What a great crowd!
Guys, I gotta tell you something.

456
00:40:51,402 --> 00:40:54,029
Last week my horoscope said,
don't pull all your eggs in one basket.

457
00:40:54,237 --> 00:40:57,297
So I'm in the supermarket.
I'm wheeling twelve shopping carts.

458
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:00,131
Thank you very much.

459
00:41:00,343 --> 00:41:02,368
Right now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to take this opportunity...

460
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,570
to introduce a very
beautiful young lady...

461
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:06,271
to come up here
and do a number with us.

462
00:41:06,483 --> 00:41:09,748
She's got a voice like a hundred carat
diamond ring and a soul to match.

463
00:41:09,953 --> 00:41:12,581
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome the lovely and talented...

464
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:14,882
Miss Lulu Mercer!

465
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:20,924
You're gonna love this!

466
00:41:26,668 --> 00:41:28,636
Hey, Lulu!

467
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:34,035
This is an old tune...

468
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:38,475
dedicated to everyone
who's ever been in love.

469
00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:43,875
<i>in the night</i>

470
00:41:44,486 --> 00:41:48,547
<i>When we're apart</i>

471
00:41:49,224 --> 00:41:51,988
<i>There's a ghost of you</i>

472
00:41:52,194 --> 00:41:56,893
<i>Within my haunted heart</i>

473
00:41:57,966 --> 00:42:00,934
<i>Ghost of you</i>

474
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:06,666
<i>My lost romance</i>

475
00:42:08,643 --> 00:42:12,079
<i>Lips that laugh</i>

476
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:16,845
<i>Eyes that dance</i>

477
00:42:19,087 --> 00:42:22,022
<i>Haunted heart</i>

478
00:42:22,857 --> 00:42:27,021
<i>Won't let me hear</i>

479
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:34,962
<i>Dreams repeat a sweet and lonely</i>

480
00:42:35,168 --> 00:42:38,695
<i>Song to me</i>

481
00:42:39,906 --> 00:42:43,569
<i>Dreams are dust</i>,
<i>it's you who must</i>

482
00:42:43,777 --> 00:42:47,508
<i>Belong to me</i>

483
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:55,616
<i>And thrill</i>
<i>My haunted heart</i>

484
00:42:57,858 --> 00:43:02,124
<i>Be still</i>

485
00:43:03,629 --> 00:43:07,360
<i>My haunted heart</i>

486
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:14,064
<i>My haunted heart</i>

487
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,420
Every time you sing that
my insides get all mushy.

488
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:45,334
It makes me wanna drag one of those
cute busboys down to the woodshed.

489
00:43:48,006 --> 00:43:51,203
Hey, that's Howard Dietz
and Arthur Schwartz, right?

490
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:52,535
-Wow!
-Yeah.

491
00:43:52,744 --> 00:43:55,178
You know, it used to be on
this jukebox...

492
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,678
back at this old college bar
I used to go to.

493
00:43:57,882 --> 00:44:01,818
-They had the Jo Stafford version.
-She did it best.

494
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:05,113
I don't know, I would have said that
until about five minutes ago, but you...

495
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:13,358
-You ever sing professionally?
-No. I messed around a bit.

496
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,433
So. Low down and funky...
seasons the soul...

497
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:24,405
but bliss is the yeast
that makes it rise.

498
00:44:24,608 --> 00:44:27,839
Go on now
before you make me blush.

499
00:44:28,045 --> 00:44:30,206
You're looking
very natty tonight, Bobby.

500
00:44:30,414 --> 00:44:31,847
But you better be careful.

501
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:34,609
One of these old vultures
is gonna kidnap you.

502
00:44:34,851 --> 00:44:37,752
-It's okay. I'm packing.
-I bet he is.

503
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:39,649
Have you met Hilda's nephew, Troy?

504
00:44:39,855 --> 00:44:43,848
I have. Bet you're looking forward
to relaxing on that new porch, huh?

505
00:44:46,128 --> 00:44:47,993
Yeah. I am.

506
00:44:58,674 --> 00:45:02,701
Well. I just wanted to say hey.

507
00:45:04,247 --> 00:45:05,737
Good seeing y'all.

508
00:45:05,948 --> 00:45:07,745
-Hilda.
-Don't start, Lulu.

509
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:10,646
That there is the nicest man
in Happy Valley.

510
00:45:10,853 --> 00:45:11,716
He used to be a cop.

511
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,081
He fixed my toilet for me
once for free.

512
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:16,655
He wants to give it to your auntie.

513
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:18,257
-Norma!
-Well, it's true.

514
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,191
It's not true. If you will just all
mind your own business? Please?

515
00:45:22,397 --> 00:45:24,797
All the time
I've known your auntie...

516
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,992
it's the only thing
she gets all ruffled up about.

517
00:45:28,203 --> 00:45:32,503
I'm not ruffled! I'm not ruffled.
I just don't like the man.

518
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:35,470
Now, who wants to go dancing?

519
00:45:37,445 --> 00:45:39,106
Are you coming, Troy?

520
00:45:39,714 --> 00:45:41,477
I will wait for the food.

521
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,780
I'll dip ya.

522
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:47,118
Next time.

523
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:56,924
Troy. Bobby wanted me
to give you this.

524
00:46:38,771 --> 00:46:41,239
So what happened between
you and that Bobby guy?

525
00:46:41,441 --> 00:46:44,467
Nothing. When he first moved here,
he kept asking me out...

526
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,237
and wouldn't take no for an answer.

527
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,408
So why didn't you go out with him?

528
00:46:51,783 --> 00:46:54,149
He irritates me.
What are you doing?

529
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:58,449
I am trying to write
some thank you notes.

530
00:46:58,657 --> 00:47:00,090
-Sympathy cards?
-Yeah.

531
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:03,352
What are you thanking them for?
Putting a card in an envelope?

532
00:47:04,262 --> 00:47:06,059
No, Mom and I thought
it might be nice, you know.

533
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:10,398
"May it help you to know
your loved one is in a better place...

534
00:47:10,602 --> 00:47:13,093
far away from the turmoil
of the human race.

535
00:47:13,305 --> 00:47:15,796
And someday, far beyond the pain
that fills your troubled heart..."

536
00:47:16,007 --> 00:47:16,837
Oh, God!

537
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,636
-Give me that one.
-I better answer this one for you.

538
00:47:20,344 --> 00:47:23,142
"Dear Bob and Gloria...

539
00:47:23,347 --> 00:47:26,578
thank you so much for your sincere
and heartfelt note.

540
00:47:26,784 --> 00:47:28,581
It really captured
the essence of Corrine...

541
00:47:28,786 --> 00:47:31,277
and helped me put her death
into perspective.

542
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:33,616
Looking forward to seeing you
at our next funeral."

543
00:47:33,824 --> 00:47:36,657
-You are so unbelievable.
-Does this mean anything to you?

544
00:47:36,894 --> 00:47:37,918
Not necessarily.
That's not the point.

545
00:47:38,129 --> 00:47:41,758
If they're not honest with you,
at least you be honest with yourself.

546
00:47:46,604 --> 00:47:48,629
I am.

547
00:47:48,906 --> 00:47:52,739
Oh, right.
And you're also just fine.

548
00:47:53,643 --> 00:47:56,942
You know, you don't owe anything
to anybody, especially now.

549
00:47:59,115 --> 00:48:02,016
I mean, if someone were to take
the time to write you a real note...

550
00:48:02,485 --> 00:48:05,977
that meant something to you,
then great, fine. Answer away.

551
00:48:06,189 --> 00:48:10,216
But, to me anyway, you know,
life's too short.

552
00:48:11,594 --> 00:48:13,789
It's way too short.

553
00:50:18,717 --> 00:50:23,279
Hey, Troy!
Wanna take a ride in an airplane?

554
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:27,519
-A what?
-Wings. You know.

555
00:50:28,127 --> 00:50:31,585
And a propeller. Little knobs.
Gauges.

556
00:50:31,997 --> 00:50:33,520
Guy I was gonna
go with had to cancel.

557
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:35,790
So I paid for the plane.
I figured I'd ask you.

558
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:37,892
You're a pilot.

559
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:42,368
No, I just woke up today and I said,
what the heck, I'm gonna fly a plane!

560
00:50:42,574 --> 00:50:44,474
Are you in or not?

561
00:50:44,676 --> 00:50:47,645
But thanks, man,
I gotta finish work, man.

562
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:50,939
-How far did you get?
-I just finished the footings.

563
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:53,811
You can't do anything else
'til the cement dries, dude.

564
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:55,042
Come on!

565
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:58,280
Come on, man.

566
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:02,823
Look. I told Corrine I was gonna
take her up. I never got around to it.

567
00:51:03,528 --> 00:51:05,359
What do you say?

568
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:08,587
Yes.

569
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,601
What the hell did you do
to this thing?

570
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:17,899
I got tired of getting stuck behind
all the blue-haired ladies...

571
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:22,408
so I gave it a little... you know.
I had it up to 63 once with a tailwind.

572
00:51:38,294 --> 00:51:40,057
What do you think of our desert, man?

573
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:45,494
It's kind of desolate.

574
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:49,235
We're wide-eyed when
contemplating the possibility...

575
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:52,430
of life on other planets
yet we wear blinders...

576
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:54,439
for the beauty right in front of us.

577
00:51:56,712 --> 00:51:58,145
Who said that?

578
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:01,943
Coulter Bradley,
the guy I was gonna fly with today.

579
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:04,642
I don't know
who said it before him.

580
00:52:06,622 --> 00:52:08,556
Where's Coulter Bradley today?

581
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:13,194
Man. His wife's heart gave out.

582
00:52:13,395 --> 00:52:17,024
She was playing golf yesterday.
Talk about having a bad round, man.

583
00:52:19,734 --> 00:52:22,202
What is wrong with you people?

584
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:23,895
You people?

585
00:52:24,105 --> 00:52:27,165
I mean, you and my aunt
and her friends, you know...

586
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:30,310
you act like when somebody dies
that it doesn't even matter to you!

587
00:52:30,512 --> 00:52:34,107
It's unbelievable!
You act like you don't even care.

588
00:52:34,649 --> 00:52:36,480
"Talk about having a bad round"!

589
00:52:36,685 --> 00:52:40,121
Maybe if you lost somebody close,
you'd show a little more respect.

590
00:52:45,793 --> 00:52:47,351
What's happening?

591
00:52:47,561 --> 00:52:49,188
-What is happening to the plane?
-It's just a stall, man.

592
00:52:49,396 --> 00:52:51,364
It happens sometimes.

593
00:52:51,565 --> 00:52:56,662
-Can you start it again?
-It usually corrects itself.

594
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:00,567
-What if it doesn't start up by itself?
-The landing can be a little rough.

595
00:53:00,774 --> 00:53:03,106
Let me ask you a question.

596
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,709
How long were you married?

597
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:08,072
-What are you...?
-How long were you married?

598
00:53:08,882 --> 00:53:12,511
-Two years. Bobby!
-I was married to the same woman...

599
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:14,742
twenty-three years.

600
00:53:14,954 --> 00:53:17,184
I had a kid with her.
I lost another.

601
00:53:17,423 --> 00:53:19,687
She taught me how to cook and
I helped her get her college degree.

602
00:53:19,892 --> 00:53:22,383
Bobby! Bobby, we gotta
talk about this plane!

603
00:53:22,595 --> 00:53:24,222
And even though
she's not around anymore...

604
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:26,489
I still respect the hell out of her.

605
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:28,724
What are you talking about?

606
00:53:29,769 --> 00:53:31,600
I know you're going through
a rough time right now, son.

607
00:53:31,804 --> 00:53:33,738
-My God!
-And you will come out if it.

608
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,434
If you let yourself.

609
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:37,472
-Oh, my God!
-But do me a favor.

610
00:53:38,644 --> 00:53:42,603
Don't compare scars.
You're not gonna win.

611
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:49,118
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

612
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,032
She didn't die, by the way.

613
00:54:04,236 --> 00:54:05,794
Who didn't die? Who?

614
00:54:06,004 --> 00:54:08,234
Bradley's wife, the golfer.
She's just in the hospital.

615
00:54:12,244 --> 00:54:15,236
You wanna fly this thing
for awhile?

616
00:54:15,447 --> 00:54:18,780
I've never flown anything in my life.

617
00:54:19,049 --> 00:54:21,847
With the possible exception of the
equator, everything starts somewhere.

618
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:24,543
You just put your hands
on the wheel...

619
00:54:24,755 --> 00:54:28,213
put your feet on the pedals
and just hold her steady, man.

620
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,110
You wanna come in for a beer?

621
00:54:57,687 --> 00:54:59,552
No, I better not.

622
00:55:02,058 --> 00:55:04,492
Man, tell me something.
What happened between you guys?

623
00:55:06,362 --> 00:55:08,660
I mean, was it just'cause
you were bugging her for a date?

624
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:11,790
-Is that what she said?
-Yeah.

625
00:55:15,205 --> 00:55:17,833
Well, you can't blame
a guy for trying, man.

626
00:55:18,308 --> 00:55:19,605
That's too bad.

627
00:55:19,809 --> 00:55:22,107
Well, thank you.
I take that as a compliment.

628
00:55:22,846 --> 00:55:24,676
Listen, man. I'm sorry too
about what I said to you before.

629
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,245
That was way out of line.

630
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:28,743
Man begins cutting
his wisdom teeth...

631
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:31,112
first time he bites off
more than he can chew.

632
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,917
Where do you get all that stuff?

633
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,523
Life, my boy. Life!

634
00:55:48,103 --> 00:55:50,003
Hi.
We've been waiting for you.

635
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,576
Lulu's selling cosmetics.

636
00:55:56,777 --> 00:55:59,610
It's like a Tupperware party,
but for the face.

637
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:03,580
-She's taking us to the cleaners.
-Oh, don't listen to them.

638
00:56:03,784 --> 00:56:07,220
Everything is very reasonably priced.

639
00:56:07,421 --> 00:56:09,412
I got great products for the men.

640
00:56:09,957 --> 00:56:12,892
Help get rid of those
dark circles under the eyes.

641
00:56:13,094 --> 00:56:15,528
We're going to the Arts Council
meeting. Mildred's on the Board.

642
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:17,493
They're deciding the first play
of the new season.

643
00:56:17,698 --> 00:56:19,461
They want to do "Duchess of Malfi".

644
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,135
It's a thousand years old
and boring, boring, boring.

645
00:56:22,336 --> 00:56:24,497
We want to do something
more contemporary.

646
00:56:24,705 --> 00:56:26,605
"La Cage aux Folles".

647
00:56:26,807 --> 00:56:28,205
So, how do we look?

648
00:56:28,408 --> 00:56:31,639
Tell us straight.
It's important we look just right.

649
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:39,779
You look ridiculous.

650
00:56:42,088 --> 00:56:46,024
We'll show those high falutin'
old biddies a thing or two about art.

651
00:56:46,459 --> 00:56:48,086
That's right!

652
00:56:48,295 --> 00:56:49,353
You bet.

653
00:56:49,596 --> 00:56:52,565
The other night when
we were going out to Bingo...

654
00:56:52,766 --> 00:56:54,427
Phyllis ran a red light.

655
00:56:55,068 --> 00:57:00,369
I said, Phyllis,
do you know you ran a red light?

656
00:57:00,572 --> 00:57:02,267
You know what she said?

657
00:57:02,574 --> 00:57:04,337
"Oh, am I driving?"

658
00:57:04,543 --> 00:57:07,171
She, she did!
Hi, sweetie. Yeah.

659
00:57:11,383 --> 00:57:13,647
I want you to come to the reservation
with me tomorrow.

660
00:57:13,852 --> 00:57:15,342
No, I got a lot of work to do
on the porch.

661
00:57:15,554 --> 00:57:17,488
No, that, that can wait.
There's something I wanna show you.

662
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:20,659
Right. So what happened to me having
to do anything I didn't wanna do?

663
00:57:20,859 --> 00:57:22,588
We leave at 5:30.

664
00:57:26,665 --> 00:57:28,758
In the morning?

665
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,339
You awake?

666
00:57:45,416 --> 00:57:47,350
You should be awake.

667
00:57:47,552 --> 00:57:50,180
It's great.

668
00:57:50,655 --> 00:57:53,021
Before dawn while
the whole world's asleep.

669
00:57:59,397 --> 00:58:04,232
<i>One of the things I love about</i>
<i>the ancient native culture is</i>...

670
00:58:04,435 --> 00:58:07,062
<i>they nevertake anything</i>
<i>in the naturalworld for granted</i>.

671
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:09,433
<i>Just nothing</i>.

672
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:14,975
<i>I mean, plants, rocks</i>,
<i>clouds, dusk, sunrise</i>.

673
00:58:15,212 --> 00:58:17,407
<i>Never for granted</i>.

674
00:58:17,948 --> 00:58:19,813
<i>I love that</i>.

675
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:35,491
This is my favorite spot.

676
00:58:39,802 --> 00:58:41,326
It kinda makes you know...

677
00:58:41,537 --> 00:58:44,802
God hasn't taken his ball
and gone home.

678
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:50,076
It's funny to hear you
talk about God.

679
00:58:51,447 --> 00:58:53,711
Why is that?

680
00:58:55,918 --> 00:58:59,752
You called it a bunch
of medieval mumbo-jumbo.

681
00:59:00,956 --> 00:59:05,984
No, I love God. It's his groupies
I have trouble with.

682
00:59:46,266 --> 00:59:49,565
-They named it after you!
-Don't sound so surprised.

683
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:51,533
So how long have you
been doing this?

684
00:59:51,738 --> 00:59:54,536
A little over five years.

685
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:57,437
I still fly off here and there,
you know, for a few months.

686
00:59:57,644 --> 00:59:59,771
-Hey, Hilda.
-Hi, Dave.

687
01:00:01,081 --> 01:00:03,276
You know, it's pretty much
my steady gig.

688
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:08,754
-You know, I just had no idea.
-Yeah, it's coming along.

689
01:00:08,956 --> 01:00:11,151
I'd kill for an X-ray machine
and a sterilizer...

690
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,884
and it'd be nice to find a doctor who
could come more than twice a month.

691
01:00:15,094 --> 01:00:17,062
What do you do when
there's no doctor around?

692
01:00:17,263 --> 01:00:19,458
-You're looking at it.
-Yeah?

693
01:00:19,665 --> 01:00:22,293
Yeah, the nearest hospital's
three hours away.

694
01:00:22,502 --> 01:00:25,300
It's a long way to go
for a few stitches.

695
01:00:25,771 --> 01:00:29,832
-You give stitches?
-I've been sewing up people forever.

696
01:00:31,244 --> 01:00:33,906
You were in the Peace Corps
or something, right?

697
01:00:34,113 --> 01:00:37,947
Yeah, most of the others,
Red Cross, UNICEF, you name it.

698
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:40,942
But you never married.

699
01:00:42,355 --> 01:00:45,290
Yeah, I never found anyone
who could keep up.

700
01:00:46,725 --> 01:00:48,454
What are we doing?

701
01:00:50,028 --> 01:00:51,052
Linda, Troy.

702
01:00:51,263 --> 01:00:53,731
-Oh, my God!
-Good to see you again.

703
01:00:53,965 --> 01:00:55,990
-How is the baby?
-She's great.

704
01:00:56,201 --> 01:00:57,600
Do you guys wanna
come in and see her?

705
01:00:57,802 --> 01:01:00,236
You know, the clinic calls.
I better go.

706
01:01:00,438 --> 01:01:01,564
Okay. Well, come in.

707
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:14,180
You should have seen the look
on your face when you found me.

708
01:01:15,353 --> 01:01:18,219
You had some pretty interesting
looks on your face, too.

709
01:01:18,422 --> 01:01:20,720
Yeah. I'm sure I did.

710
01:01:20,925 --> 01:01:22,825
I still can't believe this.

711
01:01:23,961 --> 01:01:26,259
What were you doing
out there anyway?

712
01:01:26,931 --> 01:01:29,161
Well, I'd gone to visit my doctor.

713
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:32,768
And she told me
I had two weeks left to go.

714
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:36,139
So much for modern medicine.

715
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:41,707
-You got her?
-Yeah, I got her.

716
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:48,245
There you go.

717
01:01:51,254 --> 01:01:52,619
Look at that.

718
01:02:11,274 --> 01:02:12,741
Okay, now, this is alcohol.

719
01:02:12,942 --> 01:02:15,809
I always like the way that feels,
don't you? It's so nice and cool.

720
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:19,880
And now, look.
You've had shots before, right?

721
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:22,880
And this is a syringe.
And this is what makes you well.

722
01:02:23,085 --> 01:02:25,610
So I need your help. You'll have
to count to three with me, okay?

723
01:02:25,821 --> 01:02:27,152
-Yeah.
-Okay.

724
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:31,926
One, two, three.

725
01:02:32,494 --> 01:02:33,893
How'bout that?

726
01:02:34,096 --> 01:02:36,121
-You didn't even feel it, did you?
-No.

727
01:02:36,331 --> 01:02:38,322
You're so brave.

728
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:48,372
Oh, my...!

729
01:03:16,671 --> 01:03:18,696
You can use the front door,
you know.

730
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:23,343
I had a little run-in with a hammer.

731
01:03:23,544 --> 01:03:27,343
Man oh man. Nothing centers a guy
like a little pain, huh?

732
01:03:28,181 --> 01:03:33,084
-Think I could use that screw gun?
-Yeah, well, there is a small price.

733
01:03:33,286 --> 01:03:35,777
-What price is that?
-Just a little bit of your time.

734
01:03:35,989 --> 01:03:41,154
I just acquired a small modicum
of fine domestic beer.

735
01:03:41,361 --> 01:03:45,559
And, well, I hate to drink alone,
particularly before three.

736
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,661
When you retire, you gotta have
a garden. It's in the handbook.

737
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:56,672
And, there ain't that much
that grows out here, so...

738
01:03:57,444 --> 01:03:59,001
voil!

739
01:04:00,913 --> 01:04:03,848
-Kinda big.
-Yeah. That's what I'm going for.

740
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:05,539
Just for the hell of it, you know.

741
01:04:05,751 --> 01:04:08,413
I did the same thing
when I was a kid with goldfish.

742
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,212
You know, I used to feed'em,
like, five times a day.

743
01:04:10,422 --> 01:04:13,186
I had'em up
to the size of a salmon.

744
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:17,158
-I had one explode on me.
-A goldfish?

745
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:20,222
No.

746
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,066
No, not a goldfish.

747
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:26,760
Anyway, I'm sitting
right here one day.

748
01:04:26,972 --> 01:04:28,940
And I hear this sound, you know.

749
01:04:29,141 --> 01:04:33,338
It's like the sound
of a fat lady in a tube top...

750
01:04:33,544 --> 01:04:35,239
bending over to tie her shoes,
you know.

751
01:04:35,446 --> 01:04:38,779
And just at that moment
I turn and...

752
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,816
I had cactus juice all over me.

753
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:51,253
But the upside, the upside is
I haven't had a sunburn since.

754
01:04:52,463 --> 01:04:54,021
You were saying?

755
01:04:54,465 --> 01:04:57,298
I went out to the reservation
with Hilda yesterday.

756
01:04:57,502 --> 01:04:59,902
Did you know that they
named the clinic after her?

757
01:05:00,638 --> 01:05:01,536
Really?

758
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:04,764
Yeah. I mean, they've still got a few
kinks to iron out and everything.

759
01:05:04,975 --> 01:05:08,934
They need an X-ray machine and a
bunch of medical equipment and stuff.

760
01:05:09,146 --> 01:05:11,114
But it's pretty amazing.

761
01:05:19,222 --> 01:05:21,247
So what was it like being a cop?

762
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:24,154
-Who told you I was a cop?
-Lulu.

763
01:05:24,361 --> 01:05:26,261
Lulu the Lip.

764
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:30,925
It ain't like it is on television,
I'll tell you that much.

765
01:05:31,234 --> 01:05:33,566
I do miss the donuts though.

766
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:40,132
How would you like to see the seedy
underbelly of Happy Valley?

767
01:05:40,876 --> 01:05:42,104
I thought we were sitting in it.

768
01:05:42,311 --> 01:05:43,642
Have you ever been in a bar...

769
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:48,139
where you knew that somewhere
in that bar there was a guy...

770
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:50,841
that had killed another guy?

771
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,618
What's going on, man?

772
01:06:00,629 --> 01:06:01,789
Hey, Bobby.

773
01:06:01,997 --> 01:06:03,624
What's up, pal?
How're you doing?

774
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:07,291
Hey, man. I like the earring.
Nice touch.

775
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:09,799
Hey, old man.
Let's see some I.D.

776
01:06:10,004 --> 01:06:12,905
Get outta here, man!
Guy was gonna card me.

777
01:06:13,107 --> 01:06:15,575
-Excuse me.
-Come on, Troy. Stop messing around.

778
01:06:15,777 --> 01:06:18,007
-Just put your collar down.
-Thank you.

779
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:46,806
See this guy behind you?

780
01:06:47,641 --> 01:06:50,132
He was a human soap dish
in the showers at Leavenworth.

781
01:06:50,344 --> 01:06:52,039
Seven to ten years.

782
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:54,939
This guy over here.

783
01:06:55,148 --> 01:06:57,514
Don't look. Don't look.

784
01:06:57,718 --> 01:06:59,049
Don't know what he's doing here.

785
01:06:59,253 --> 01:07:01,949
He drives a moped
and lives with his mom.

786
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:13,256
I think I got a live one.
Let me do all the talking.

787
01:07:13,466 --> 01:07:14,455
Excuse me. Miss?

788
01:07:14,667 --> 01:07:16,032
-Bobby.
-Hey, miss!

789
01:07:16,235 --> 01:07:18,897
-What are you doing?
-No, no. The one behind you.

790
01:07:19,405 --> 01:07:23,034
Lady! Can you come over here
for a second, sweetheart?

791
01:07:23,242 --> 01:07:24,675
-I wanna ask you something.
-Bobby.

792
01:07:24,877 --> 01:07:27,937
Atta boy. Atta boy.

793
01:07:28,548 --> 01:07:30,311
Well, actually it's more
my friend over here.

794
01:07:30,516 --> 01:07:32,848
He was checking you out.

795
01:07:33,152 --> 01:07:35,518
He thinks you're kinda hot.

796
01:07:35,721 --> 01:07:37,484
Is that right?

797
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:40,955
Well. I think
he's kinda hot himself.

798
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,650
Okay, that's nice...

799
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:47,221
Hack, say hello to Troy.
Troy, Hack.

800
01:07:48,133 --> 01:07:50,795
He owns the joint.

801
01:07:51,202 --> 01:07:52,430
Good to know you.

802
01:07:52,637 --> 01:07:56,164
So, how's that old lady of yours?
She throw you out on your ass yet?

803
01:07:56,374 --> 01:07:57,932
Not so far today.

804
01:07:58,143 --> 01:08:00,577
But we're still fighting
like asses and elephants.

805
01:08:00,812 --> 01:08:04,612
Hack here is suffering from
a bad case of love at first sight.

806
01:08:05,116 --> 01:08:06,743
Tell him about it, Hack.

807
01:08:06,952 --> 01:08:11,514
Well, the way I see it,
there's two kinds of love.

808
01:08:11,723 --> 01:08:14,521
There's true love
and love at first sight.

809
01:08:15,226 --> 01:08:16,852
Now, true love's the healthy kind.

810
01:08:17,061 --> 01:08:20,394
That's where you meet somebody,
you get to know'em, fall in love...

811
01:08:20,598 --> 01:08:22,759
and you get married, have kids.
Live happily ever after.

812
01:08:22,967 --> 01:08:26,733
Now, you find that, you're lucky.
Hold onto it for dear life.

813
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:31,073
Now, love at first sight,
that only happens once in a lifetime.

814
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:35,405
Maybe twice. But when that happens,
you're screwed, man.

815
01:08:35,613 --> 01:08:38,480
You are sucked into a vortex,
there's no getting out.

816
01:08:39,316 --> 01:08:41,580
And you don't even have
to like the person.

817
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:43,548
'Cause neither your mind
nor your heart...

818
01:08:43,754 --> 01:08:46,917
nor your Johnson
is in any kind of control.

819
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:51,054
You'll be in control from a place
you didn't even know you had.

820
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:52,993
That's me.

821
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:55,722
-That's him.
-Unfortunately...

822
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,525
love at first site's usually too
top heavy for most mere mortals...

823
01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:01,226
and just crashes and burns.

824
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:06,136
But if you can manage to find
some sorta equilibrium...

825
01:09:06,376 --> 01:09:07,843
some balance...

826
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:11,205
then you're there.
Quintessence.

827
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:12,881
You know,
I just realized something.

828
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,647
You're much deeper than you look.

829
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,386
Well, I gotta go buy my wife
some pantyhose.

830
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:21,050
Good idea.

831
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:26,592
Do not let this guy get you into
politics, Troy. He will never shut up!

832
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:29,492
Everything's on the house tonight,
right, Hack?

833
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,598
For you? No!

834
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:35,326
My buddy.

835
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:36,795
He's amazing.

836
01:09:37,005 --> 01:09:40,441
He's just a big windbag.
You big windbag!

837
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:43,871
Did you ever talk to my wife
about this stuff?

838
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,878
I don't recall.

839
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,812
Listen to this.

840
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,149
It says, "you were my love
at first sight".

841
01:09:55,956 --> 01:09:58,982
You know, I don't remember
her ever talking like that before.

842
01:10:01,395 --> 01:10:03,295
Far out, man.

843
01:10:09,003 --> 01:10:11,437
There's something else
I don't understand.

844
01:10:12,006 --> 01:10:16,170
She said maybe I'd figure out
how to "uncross the stars".

845
01:10:17,545 --> 01:10:18,807
Know what means?

846
01:10:20,948 --> 01:10:22,210
I saw you the other night,
actually...

847
01:10:22,416 --> 01:10:25,283
you were checking out
the stars on your roof.

848
01:10:25,485 --> 01:10:28,613
-One star, actually.
-Which star?

849
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:34,159
Alright. Don't laugh at me, alright?
It's kinda weird.

850
01:10:34,828 --> 01:10:38,229
But shortly after
my old lady died...

851
01:10:38,431 --> 01:10:42,663
I noticed that every time I looked up,
I saw this one certain star.

852
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:45,538
And what was weird about it was
it wasn't the brightest...

853
01:10:45,739 --> 01:10:48,333
it wasn't the biggest,
it wasn't distinguished in any way.

854
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:52,841
It's just that it was always there
in the same spot, even if I did, like...

855
01:10:53,313 --> 01:10:54,678
there it was.

856
01:10:54,881 --> 01:10:56,906
And I finally figured it out.

857
01:10:58,217 --> 01:10:59,684
It was my old lady.

858
01:11:01,153 --> 01:11:06,056
It was Suki. Just kinda hanging
around and keeping her eye on me.

859
01:11:10,896 --> 01:11:12,591
That's really beautiful.

860
01:11:15,868 --> 01:11:19,167
You wanna meet her?
Maybe she knows Corrine.

861
01:11:27,646 --> 01:11:28,704
It'd be nice.

862
01:11:29,914 --> 01:11:32,405
-Nice shot.
-Thank you.

863
01:11:38,723 --> 01:11:42,489
The stars are so many
they seem to overlap.

864
01:11:44,862 --> 01:11:47,558
They always like this?

865
01:11:47,965 --> 01:11:51,423
You gotta learn to see
what's in front of you, boy.

866
01:11:52,103 --> 01:11:56,369
The beginning of wisdom is having
a firm grasp on the obvious.

867
01:11:59,911 --> 01:12:01,640
There she is.

868
01:12:05,182 --> 01:12:07,377
Right there.

869
01:12:08,585 --> 01:12:11,349
I can't tell which one is her.

870
01:12:11,555 --> 01:12:14,319
No, I guess you can't.

871
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:18,120
How'd you meet her, man?

872
01:12:22,933 --> 01:12:28,769
I was a P.O.W. in Nam.

873
01:12:29,472 --> 01:12:32,339
And I was busted up pretty good.

874
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:36,705
And she was a nurse
and a spy for the S.V.A.

875
01:12:37,546 --> 01:12:39,446
She saved my life
and then she asked me...

876
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:42,310
if I could help get her
out of the country.

877
01:12:42,518 --> 01:12:45,487
I mean, they'd have killed her
if I left her there.

878
01:12:45,788 --> 01:12:49,918
We spent three weeks in a swamp,
but we made it.

879
01:12:51,393 --> 01:12:53,361
When we got to Saigon...

880
01:12:53,562 --> 01:12:56,588
well, the only way to get her out
of there was if I married her.

881
01:12:57,499 --> 01:12:59,626
Was it true love
or was it love at first sight?

882
01:12:59,835 --> 01:13:04,397
It was neither, man.
It was just the right thing to do.

883
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:08,702
But it ended up being true.

884
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:11,611
Have you ever had
love at first sight?

885
01:13:11,813 --> 01:13:14,839
Man, you ask a lot of questions.

886
01:13:15,116 --> 01:13:17,050
Jesus!

887
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,817
Maybe once.

888
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,614
What happened?

889
01:13:22,824 --> 01:13:24,485
Didn't work out.

890
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:31,528
So...

891
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:34,494
anything?

892
01:13:36,738 --> 01:13:38,637
Well, she'll be around.

893
01:13:39,473 --> 01:13:41,270
When you're ready to see her.

894
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:43,934
I'm ready now.

895
01:13:44,144 --> 01:13:46,806
Yeah.
She'll be the judge of that.

896
01:13:54,621 --> 01:13:56,282
Hey, guys.

897
01:14:03,931 --> 01:14:05,922
What's wrong?

898
01:14:06,133 --> 01:14:08,226
It's Lulu.

899
01:14:16,909 --> 01:14:22,814
When I come to the end of the road,
and the sun has set for me...

900
01:14:23,649 --> 01:14:27,676
I want no rites
in a gloom-filled room.

901
01:14:28,955 --> 01:14:32,550
Why cry for a soul set free?

902
01:14:33,459 --> 01:14:38,829
When you are lonely and
sick of heart, go to the friends...

903
01:14:41,334 --> 01:14:43,267
you know.

904
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:48,667
And bury your sorrow
in doing good.

905
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:55,744
Miss me, but let me go.

906
01:15:06,858 --> 01:15:09,088
For heaven's sakes!

907
01:15:10,428 --> 01:15:12,362
As many of you know...

908
01:15:13,365 --> 01:15:15,992
I like to tell a joke
now and then.

909
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:20,000
And this,
this one was Lulu's favorite.

910
01:15:20,637 --> 01:15:24,334
This old man and this old woman,
they were sitting at a bar...

911
01:15:24,575 --> 01:15:28,671
and looking and eyeing
each other up and down.

912
01:15:28,879 --> 01:15:32,076
And finally the old man,
he shuffles over to her and says...

913
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:34,842
"You wanna do it?"

914
01:15:35,052 --> 01:15:39,887
The old woman shrugs and says,
"Your place or mine?"

915
01:15:40,924 --> 01:15:43,154
The old man looks at her, says...

916
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:47,319
"Well, if you're gonna argue
about it, let's forget all about it!"

917
01:16:04,213 --> 01:16:06,943
I know I can't do Lulu
justice to this...

918
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:09,448
but it was the best thing
she ever gave me.

919
01:16:12,755 --> 01:16:16,247
<i>In the night</i>

920
01:16:16,459 --> 01:16:20,189
<i>Though we're apart</i>

921
01:16:20,962 --> 01:16:24,022
<i>There's a ghost of you</i>

922
01:16:24,232 --> 01:16:28,669
<i>Within my haunted heart</i>

923
01:16:29,571 --> 01:16:32,699
<i>Ghost of you</i>

924
01:16:33,341 --> 01:16:37,710
<i>My lost romance</i>

925
01:16:38,146 --> 01:16:44,142
<i>Lips that laugh</i>
<i>Eyes that dance</i>

926
01:16:46,988 --> 01:16:48,148
I don't know what the hell
I'm doing here.

927
01:16:48,356 --> 01:16:49,687
What am I doing here?
I should be gone like...

928
01:16:49,891 --> 01:16:52,518
It's alright, it's okay.
You're allowed to cry.

929
01:16:52,726 --> 01:16:55,126
-No, I'm not allowed to cry.
-Yes, of course you are.

930
01:16:55,429 --> 01:16:57,829
Not for someone I've known
for four days. I can't do that!

931
01:16:58,032 --> 01:17:01,001
What's that have to do with anything?
If you need to cry, do it. It's okay.

932
01:17:01,202 --> 01:17:03,602
I haven't cried for my wife.

933
01:17:05,306 --> 01:17:07,240
I haven't, I haven't cried for...

934
01:17:07,441 --> 01:17:10,501
It's been almost a month
and I haven't cried for my wife.

935
01:17:10,711 --> 01:17:12,269
What is wrong with me?

936
01:17:12,546 --> 01:17:15,037
It doesn't mean you don't love her. It
means you haven't broken through yet.

937
01:17:15,249 --> 01:17:16,841
You have no idea
what you're talking...

938
01:17:17,051 --> 01:17:18,575
Do you love her?

939
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:21,988
Do I love her?

940
01:17:22,823 --> 01:17:25,484
I love her more than anything
else in the world.

941
01:17:25,692 --> 01:17:29,924
-Of course I love her!
-Then that's all that matters.

942
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:34,264
I just, I can't see anything.

943
01:17:34,467 --> 01:17:36,264
Do you know what I mean?
Like I can't see anything...

944
01:17:36,469 --> 01:17:40,428
all I can see is my wife's body and
she's lying on the kitchen floor.

945
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,130
Do you understand how that feels?

946
01:17:42,342 --> 01:17:47,370
Like all day, all day,
every day, that's all I see!

947
01:17:47,814 --> 01:17:50,339
She never spoke to me about this,
about the sickness...

948
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,950
she never talked to me about
headaches, about any of this stuff.

949
01:17:53,153 --> 01:17:58,055
I mean, what kind of a husband
doesn't know his wife is sick?

950
01:18:02,394 --> 01:18:04,555
I shouldn't have taken her
to the hospital...

951
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:06,491
I shouldn't have taken her.
I shouldn't...

952
01:18:06,698 --> 01:18:08,256
Of course you should have.

953
01:18:08,467 --> 01:18:10,401
-Of course you should.
-I made a mistake.

954
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:13,696
No, you didn't make a mistake.

955
01:18:14,306 --> 01:18:17,332
No, it's not your fault.

956
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:21,178
It's not your fault.

957
01:18:22,247 --> 01:18:23,737
Just let it go.

958
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,440
I'm not good.
I'm not a good man.

959
01:18:26,652 --> 01:18:29,119
-Yes, you are.
-I'm not. I'm not a good man.

960
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,345
Yes, you are.

961
01:18:33,591 --> 01:18:37,027
It's okay. It's good.

962
01:18:37,261 --> 01:18:38,819
This is good.

963
01:18:43,401 --> 01:18:46,029
I always spent
too much time at work.

964
01:18:48,272 --> 01:18:50,900
I should have played
more with her.

965
01:18:51,108 --> 01:18:53,008
She worked, too.

966
01:18:53,644 --> 01:18:56,875
Yeah, but, you know, she laughed
so much more than I did.

967
01:18:57,682 --> 01:19:00,048
Well, she's more evolved
than you are.

968
01:19:07,123 --> 01:19:09,887
You know there's something
I still can't figure out.

969
01:19:10,827 --> 01:19:12,795
Why did she have me come out
here to build the porch?

970
01:19:12,996 --> 01:19:14,725
I can't figure that out.

971
01:19:14,998 --> 01:19:18,798
I don't know. She never
mentioned any porch to me.

972
01:19:26,576 --> 01:19:30,808
She set it up. That little...!

973
01:19:32,349 --> 01:19:35,112
Corrine set this whole thing up.

974
01:19:36,285 --> 01:19:38,344
I think that's the first time
I've heard you say her name...

975
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:41,546
since you've been here.

976
01:19:43,525 --> 01:19:46,926
You know, when I first met her
I thought her name was Karen.

977
01:19:47,596 --> 01:19:49,530
We went out to this party...

978
01:19:49,732 --> 01:19:51,563
her friends thought
I was the biggest idiot.

979
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:54,497
I kept calling her Karen
all night long.

980
01:19:54,703 --> 01:19:57,672
I thought she was never
gonna wanna see me again.

981
01:19:59,642 --> 01:20:03,009
She turned up at my apartment
the next day.

982
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:06,669
Next, yeah. I mean,
it was like she already knew.

983
01:20:06,881 --> 01:20:10,248
She just came in, then she started
redecorating everything.

984
01:20:10,451 --> 01:20:13,818
And she hated my couch.

985
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:20,016
Hey, Troy.

986
01:20:20,228 --> 01:20:21,820
-Hang on a sec.
-What's that?

987
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:24,123
-Hang on.
-Yeah.

988
01:20:30,038 --> 01:20:30,527
Six and a half.

989
01:20:30,738 --> 01:20:32,205
-Is that your mark?
-Yeah.

990
01:20:36,377 --> 01:20:39,038
Try that on for size, will you?

991
01:20:42,282 --> 01:20:44,011
Thank you.

992
01:20:58,565 --> 01:21:02,365
That's one good-looking deck.
Even if I do say so myself.

993
01:21:02,569 --> 01:21:05,504
It's a porch.

994
01:21:08,175 --> 01:21:09,766
Thanks, man.

995
01:21:12,278 --> 01:21:13,506
Check this out.

996
01:21:13,713 --> 01:21:15,681
I may have a bead
on some medical equipment.

997
01:21:15,881 --> 01:21:17,143
-You sly dog.
-Dude.

998
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:20,717
Buddy of mine has a buddy who runs
the evidence room at the local P.D.

999
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,514
He confiscated all this stuff
from this Medicare scam.

1000
01:21:23,723 --> 01:21:25,816
Says he's gonna
let me have it cheap.

1001
01:21:27,093 --> 01:21:28,617
Troy, I want...

1002
01:21:29,128 --> 01:21:31,653
Hey! What do you think
of the deck?

1003
01:21:31,864 --> 01:21:33,729
Bobby gave me a hand.

1004
01:21:47,312 --> 01:21:48,870
Bobby.

1005
01:21:49,614 --> 01:21:51,479
Hey, wait. Wait a second!

1006
01:21:52,484 --> 01:21:54,179
Bobby. Bobby!

1007
01:21:54,386 --> 01:21:56,820
Bobby, wait!

1008
01:22:09,334 --> 01:22:10,699
B-1.

1009
01:22:11,836 --> 01:22:13,394
B-1.

1010
01:22:29,887 --> 01:22:32,114
G-51.

1011
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,424
I need to talk with you guys.

1012
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,187
You're kidding.

1013
01:22:38,395 --> 01:22:39,987
-Wait, everybody. Hey, guys.
-What?

1014
01:22:40,197 --> 01:22:41,630
I need to talk
to y'all outside, alright?

1015
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:44,767
Can't it wait a minute? All I need
is I-18 and I win the Thigh Master!

1016
01:22:44,968 --> 01:22:47,197
Outside. Right now.

1017
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:49,833
I-18.

1018
01:22:50,473 --> 01:22:54,170
-Bingo!
-Shit!

1019
01:22:55,645 --> 01:22:57,476
-I need to talk.
-What about?

1020
01:23:01,417 --> 01:23:03,578
I need to know what the story
is between Hilda and Bobby.

1021
01:23:05,021 --> 01:23:06,147
Come on!

1022
01:23:06,355 --> 01:23:08,289
Something's going on. Nobody's
talking to me about it. What is it?

1023
01:23:08,691 --> 01:23:10,852
-We have to tell him.
-But we promised.

1024
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:14,552
We never should have.
This has gone on long enough.

1025
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:16,760
They used to be engaged.

1026
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:20,862
They were just kids then.

1027
01:23:21,436 --> 01:23:24,428
And he was sent to Vietnam
before they could get married.

1028
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,470
When he came back here...

1029
01:23:26,675 --> 01:23:28,973
Hilda went to see him
at the V.A. Hospital.

1030
01:23:29,544 --> 01:23:30,772
His wife was there.

1031
01:23:30,979 --> 01:23:33,777
Right. Because he had to marry
Suki to get her out of Vietnam.

1032
01:23:33,982 --> 01:23:36,780
-Did he explain that to Hilda?
-No chance.

1033
01:23:36,985 --> 01:23:39,078
She joined the Red Cross
and left the next day.

1034
01:23:39,287 --> 01:23:42,188
Even if he had explained,
he was still married.

1035
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:45,450
After Bobby's wife died,
he tracked Hilda down here.

1036
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:48,595
He did everything he could,
but she wouldn't forgive him.

1037
01:23:48,964 --> 01:23:51,932
He bought that house up the street
hoping he'd wear her down.

1038
01:23:52,132 --> 01:23:54,327
He even leaves her
a sunflower every day.

1039
01:23:54,535 --> 01:23:56,867
-That's from Bobby?
-Isn't it so romantic?

1040
01:23:57,071 --> 01:23:59,869
He even has a tattoo
of one on his shoulder.

1041
01:24:00,174 --> 01:24:02,506
I just can't believe her.
She is such a hypocrite.

1042
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:03,734
No, she's not!

1043
01:24:03,944 --> 01:24:07,311
She has a man living down the street
from her who's loved her since...

1044
01:24:07,681 --> 01:24:10,514
I mean, since I was born at least.
And she can't even talk to the guy.

1045
01:24:10,718 --> 01:24:14,882
Sometimes the hardest person
to give advice to is yourself.

1046
01:24:15,489 --> 01:24:18,219
Thank you for that.
Trite and clich.

1047
01:24:18,959 --> 01:24:20,256
I'm getting outta here.

1048
01:24:20,461 --> 01:24:22,826
Don't give up on her, Troy.
Please!

1049
01:24:23,463 --> 01:24:25,556
Corrine wouldn't want you to.

1050
01:24:31,404 --> 01:24:32,962
My wife knew about this?

1051
01:24:33,172 --> 01:24:35,800
Sure. She called them
the "Star-Crossed Lovers".

1052
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:42,439
I've got something to show you.
Come on. Hey, girls!

1053
01:24:42,649 --> 01:24:44,913
-Hi, Bobby.
-Nice to see you.

1054
01:24:45,118 --> 01:24:47,814
-So what is it?
-It's an X-ray machine.

1055
01:24:48,655 --> 01:24:50,088
Your buddy's buddy didn't
wanna give it to us at first...

1056
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:54,021
but I gotta say our girls
could be pretty persuasive.

1057
01:24:55,327 --> 01:24:58,592
-I hope it gets put to good use.
-Wait a second, Bobby.

1058
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:03,834
I want you to take this out
to the reservation with us.

1059
01:25:05,203 --> 01:25:07,535
Come on, Bobby. I know what
happened between you and Hilda.

1060
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:12,039
What's the one thing in the world that
means more to Hilda than anything?

1061
01:25:12,244 --> 01:25:13,370
It's her clinic, right?

1062
01:25:13,579 --> 01:25:16,104
Let's just forget the head.
Let's go for the heart.

1063
01:25:17,316 --> 01:25:20,808
Bobby, I know you love her!

1064
01:25:27,191 --> 01:25:29,250
Never argue with an idiot, Bobby.

1065
01:25:30,027 --> 01:25:34,054
They'll drag you down to their level.
They'll beat you with experience!

1066
01:25:41,272 --> 01:25:42,705
That was pretty good.

1067
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:45,170
Did you like that?
I felt like I mixed up the metaphors.

1068
01:25:45,376 --> 01:25:49,312
No, you did, but you more than
made up for it with your delivery.

1069
01:25:49,513 --> 01:25:51,504
-Thank you.
-You've got potential, kid.

1070
01:25:52,049 --> 01:25:54,176
I mean, you're no Buddy Hackett,
but I'll work with you.

1071
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:56,381
I don't know if that's
a good thing or a bad thing.

1072
01:25:56,587 --> 01:25:58,748
I'm gonna have you writing
fortune cookies before it's all over.

1073
01:25:58,956 --> 01:26:00,320
-Just get in the truck.
-Why don't you get in the truck?

1074
01:26:00,523 --> 01:26:02,081
You get in the truck.

1075
01:26:03,994 --> 01:26:05,757
She was very lucky
she didn't break anything.

1076
01:26:05,962 --> 01:26:07,953
I'm gonna give you some
of this gauze. You take it home...

1077
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:09,722
and every time it gets dirty...

1078
01:26:09,933 --> 01:26:11,901
probably by the time you
get home, you'll need to redo it.

1079
01:26:12,102 --> 01:26:13,933
-And every time it gets wet...
-And don't spoil the surprise.

1080
01:26:14,137 --> 01:26:15,798
Keep the surprise.
You're not...

1081
01:26:16,006 --> 01:26:18,736
-What's all this?
-We have a surprise for you.

1082
01:26:18,942 --> 01:26:20,409
-I'm a little busy.
-No, come on.

1083
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:22,271
Get your butt outta here.
Come on!

1084
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:25,710
Five seconds. Just give us
five seconds. Come on.

1085
01:26:25,915 --> 01:26:28,509
-Where? What?
-Straight ahead. Straight.

1086
01:26:28,785 --> 01:26:30,446
Right, to the right.

1087
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,114
We found an X-ray machine.

1088
01:26:33,322 --> 01:26:37,053
There's a blood analyzer
and an instrument sterilizer.

1089
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:42,355
-How on earth did you find this?
-From a friend of ours.

1090
01:26:42,765 --> 01:26:46,531
He heard what great work you're
doing out here and wanted to help.

1091
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,227
Who is it?

1092
01:27:04,686 --> 01:27:06,483
Thank you very much.

1093
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:10,247
You're welcome, Hilda.

1094
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:21,295
That's okay.
Wait a second.

1095
01:27:45,192 --> 01:27:47,422
-What are you doing?
-I'm getting the hell outta here.

1096
01:27:49,062 --> 01:27:51,189
Look, I know what happened
between you and Bobby.

1097
01:27:51,398 --> 01:27:55,095
What do you think you know?
You don't know anything.

1098
01:27:55,302 --> 01:27:57,668
You know what it feels like
to spend a year of your life...

1099
01:27:57,871 --> 01:28:00,669
not knowing if the person
you love is dead or alive...

1100
01:28:00,874 --> 01:28:02,569
or being tortured? Do you?

1101
01:28:02,876 --> 01:28:06,141
Do you know what it felt like
to finally find out he's safe...

1102
01:28:06,346 --> 01:28:11,146
and go to the hospital room
and there he is with his... wife.

1103
01:28:11,951 --> 01:28:15,011
Do you know how that felt with his
engagement ring on my finger? Do you?

1104
01:28:15,221 --> 01:28:17,917
She saved his life, alright?
He had to marry her to save hers.

1105
01:28:18,124 --> 01:28:19,853
He didn't have to stay with her.

1106
01:28:20,059 --> 01:28:21,424
He didn't have
to have a child with her.

1107
01:28:21,627 --> 01:28:24,289
Hey, you disappeared. What the hell
was this guy supposed to do?

1108
01:28:24,597 --> 01:28:27,395
Look, I told you how I felt about
him when you first got here.

1109
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,498
You should have left it alone.

1110
01:28:28,701 --> 01:28:31,169
I told you how I felt when I first got
here and you didn't leave that alone.

1111
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:33,304
-That's different.
-Why?

1112
01:28:34,039 --> 01:28:35,973
Why is it different?
Why is it different?

1113
01:28:36,909 --> 01:28:38,843
You've wasted the first half
of your life because of this stuff.

1114
01:28:39,044 --> 01:28:40,567
Do you think it's wise
to waste the rest of it too?

1115
01:28:40,779 --> 01:28:42,747
What do you expect me to do?
Just pretend it didn't happen?

1116
01:28:42,947 --> 01:28:45,882
I can't believe you, you know?
I can't believe you!

1117
01:28:46,084 --> 01:28:47,449
You're such an expert
at giving other people advice.

1118
01:28:47,652 --> 01:28:51,383
You're a real idiot when it comes
to yourself, do you know that?

1119
01:28:51,923 --> 01:28:54,016
You know, how dare you?

1120
01:28:56,895 --> 01:28:59,489
How dare you waste this chance?

1121
01:29:42,873 --> 01:29:44,340
Hey, baby.

1122
01:29:45,675 --> 01:29:47,700
It's me.

1123
01:29:48,945 --> 01:29:51,311
Guess you know that, right?

1124
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:56,015
So, what do you think of the deck?

1125
01:29:56,219 --> 01:29:58,813
Porch. This thing, whatever.

1126
01:30:00,022 --> 01:30:02,115
We're gonna finish it tomorrow.

1127
01:30:03,025 --> 01:30:05,789
Not that that's why you had me
come out here, but...

1128
01:30:06,729 --> 01:30:09,220
I did it anyway, so there.

1129
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,693
Me and Bobby.

1130
01:30:14,170 --> 01:30:17,104
I think you probably
planned that, too.

1131
01:30:23,979 --> 01:30:28,279
Sweetheart, I'm sorry I couldn't
figure out how to uncross the stars.

1132
01:30:29,084 --> 01:30:31,575
Man, she's so stubborn!

1133
01:30:32,854 --> 01:30:36,051
You know, if she could see
what she was missing.

1134
01:30:37,058 --> 01:30:41,051
Damn it, I'd give anything in the
world to have a second chance.

1135
01:30:46,368 --> 01:30:48,563
But it's not gonna happen.

1136
01:30:50,504 --> 01:30:52,369
That's okay.

1137
01:30:58,012 --> 01:30:58,979
You know something?

1138
01:30:59,179 --> 01:31:01,170
I think I might have
figured out why...

1139
01:31:01,382 --> 01:31:04,351
I haven't been able
to find your star yet.

1140
01:31:06,787 --> 01:31:11,349
And it's not 'cause you've been
hiding from me, you know.

1141
01:31:13,127 --> 01:31:16,062
I've been hiding from you.

1142
01:31:17,598 --> 01:31:23,229
I'm not sure, I think maybe I was
just ashamed to admit that...

1143
01:31:26,039 --> 01:31:32,035
to admit that I can go on...
That I can go on without you.

1144
01:31:35,114 --> 01:31:36,604
<i>It's just</i>...

1145
01:31:36,816 --> 01:31:39,410
<i>There's so much</i>
<i>I've gotta do here, baby</i>.

1146
01:31:40,019 --> 01:31:42,351
<i>Down here in the world</i>.
<i>And I</i>...

1147
01:31:44,257 --> 01:31:48,785
<i>and I'm gonna need you</i>.
<i>I need you</i>.

1148
01:31:49,662 --> 01:31:51,721
<i>I love you so much, baby</i>.

1149
01:31:54,066 --> 01:31:56,660
You're my love at first sight.

1150
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:27,520
Bobby?

1151
01:32:28,933 --> 01:32:31,094
Hey, Bobby!

1152
01:32:33,704 --> 01:32:35,968
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

1153
01:32:36,972 --> 01:32:41,735
- You sleep in today?
- No, I had a really long night.

1154
01:32:42,013 --> 01:32:45,210
Listen. I'm really sorry
about what happened yesterday.

1155
01:32:45,416 --> 01:32:47,475
-I should have left that alone.
-Man, that's cool.

1156
01:32:47,685 --> 01:32:49,312
No, it's not cool. You know what?
You're a great guy...

1157
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,681
you deserve a whole lot
better than that.

1158
01:32:51,889 --> 01:32:54,289
She... I thought
she was different, man.

1159
01:32:55,826 --> 01:32:59,317
I guess it's easier to do as I say
than to do as I do though, right?

1160
01:33:01,498 --> 01:33:03,295
You're right.

1161
01:33:04,467 --> 01:33:06,799
Come look what this guy's
been wasting his time on.

1162
01:33:23,319 --> 01:33:25,512
I told you he was crazy.

1163
01:33:38,634 --> 01:33:41,364
Okay, well...

1164
01:33:41,837 --> 01:33:43,395
I'm probably not necessary
at this moment in time...

1165
01:33:43,605 --> 01:33:46,005
so I think I might just...

1166
01:33:46,342 --> 01:33:48,037
Thank you.
