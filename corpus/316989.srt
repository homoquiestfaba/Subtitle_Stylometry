36
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:20,331
Is this the Parr residence?

37
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:23,656
Yes! I'm Kari - the babysitter!

38
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,206
Well, hello - Kari... I'm...

39
00:03:26,545 --> 00:03:29,131
You're my replacement,
thank heavens you've come!

40
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:32,141
What's the "S" stand for?

41
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:35,703
for... sitter! Yeah, sitter.

42
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:38,820
Originally i was going to have
the initials for babysitter

43
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:41,989
but then I'd be going around with a big BS

44
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:44,421
and you understand why
I couldn't go with that.

45
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:45,695
And you believed him

46
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:50,742
The baby was exploding! Have you ever
seen an exploding baby before, Mr. Dicker?

47
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,781
What's that?

48
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,019
You told anyone else
about this? your parents?

49
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:57,472
Yeah, they tought I was beeing funny.

50
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,366
But you believe me. Don't you Mr. Dicker?

51
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:01,638
Sure kid

52
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:04,175
I just wish I could
forget the whole thing.

53
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:05,549
You will kid...

54
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:08,537
