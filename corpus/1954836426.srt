00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,518
Hey, can I have your number?

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,021
- Hello?
- It's Stacie from volleyball.

4
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:11,392
- Listen, I can't talk right now.
-Yeah, go right ahead.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,108
Just your run of the mill double homicide investigation.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,858
Shut up. Can I call you later?

7
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,921
- You got a date?
- Yeah, I do.

8
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:24,446
If you could have anything, what would it be?
What's your dream?

9
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:28,194
A house, a dog, a woman I love, loves me.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,750
Me too.

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,106
Give me a second here.
This domestic partnership thing is new.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,850
I kind of like the idea of you as a kept woman.

13
00:00:37,493 --> 00:00:39,269
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. I think I pulled a muscle.

14
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:40,937
- You want to get it checked out?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,780
My name is Detective Laurel Hester.

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,721
I've worked for the Ocean County Police Department for 23 years.

17
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:50,718
Recently, I was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer.

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,673
When my heterosexual colleagues die,
their pensions go to their spouses.

19
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:57,556
But because my partner is a woman,
I don't get to do that.

20
00:00:58,063 --> 00:01:00,315
In my career, I've never asked for special treatment.

21
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:02,445
I'm only asking for equality.

22
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:06,900
We anguish over this situation.
But we have to deny your request.

23
00:01:09,062 --> 00:01:10,889
This is an outrageous miscarriage of justice.

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,742
At their next meeting, we show up with 100 protesters.

25
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,500
Radicals and strangers from New York ..

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,209
- ..aren't going to convince these guys.
- I am not a radical.

27
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:20,684
I am a middle class Jewish homosexual from New Jersey.

28
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:22,128
How about you, sweetheart?

29
00:01:22,328 --> 00:01:25,932
I'm a straight, white, ex-Protestant, atheist cop.

30
00:01:26,132 --> 00:01:27,779
You OK with that, sweetheart?

31
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:29,417
I am. That is very hot.

32
00:01:31,104 --> 00:01:32,006
I'm worried about Stacie.

33
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:33,964
She'd had so much to deal with.

34
00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:35,485
- You know, she's so young.
- I love you.

35
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,318
- It's not fair.
- No, it isn't.

36
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:41,742
I want to tell you about our house.

37
00:01:42,142 --> 00:01:45,873
I'd just really like to hold on to it
and remember how much we love each other.

38
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:49,568
If they say yes, then my tax dollars go to her girlfriend.

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,906
Yeah, the same way your wife gets your pension if you die.

40
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:53,106
Yeah, but she's my wife.

41
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:55,902
Hell, if you and I got married tomorrow, I'd be entitled to your benefits.

42
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:58,137
- Is that a proposal?
- Oh, my god.

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,626
We are sticking to a losing position because of some personal beliefs.

44
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,181
It's an opportunity to change the world.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,887
The only thing I care about is justice for the woman that I love.

46
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:23,895
