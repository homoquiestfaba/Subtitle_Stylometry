1
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:11,389
You don't understand.

2
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,631
Krypton's core is collapsing.

3
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,836
We may only
have a matter of weeks.

4
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:19,605
I warned you,
harvesting the core was suicide.

5
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:21,907
It has accelerated
the process of implosion.

6
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:26,677
Our energy reserves were exhausted,
what would you have us do, El?

7
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:30,241
Look to the stars.
Like our ancestors did.

8
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:32,273
There are habitable worlds
within reach.

9
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:34,350
We can begin
by using the old outposts.

10
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:37,853
Are seriously suggesting that
we evacuate the entire planet?

11
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,422
No, everybody here
is already dead.

12
00:02:42,557 --> 00:02:47,059
Give me the control of the codex,
I will ensure the survival of our race.

13
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:52,130
There is still hope,
I have held that hope in my hand.

14
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:10,711
- This council has been disbanded.
- On whose authority?

15
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:12,812
Mine.

16
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:19,327
The rest of you will be tried
and punished accordingly.

17
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:23,721
What are you doing, Zod?!
This is madness!

18
00:03:23,764 --> 00:03:27,957
What I should done years ago! These
lawmakers with their endless debates

19
00:03:28,024 --> 00:03:30,326
have led Krypton to ruin!

20
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,262
And if your forces prevail?
You be the leader of nothing.

21
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:40,942
Then join me, help me
save our race, we'll start anew.

22
00:03:40,994 --> 00:03:45,197
We'll sever the degenerated
bloodlines that led us to this state.

23
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:48,840
And who will decide
which bloodline survives, Zod?

24
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:51,942
You?

25
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:57,624
Don't do this, El. The last thing
I want is for us to be enemies.

26
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:00,649
You have abandoned the principles
that bound us together,

27
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:03,918
You've taken up the sword
against your own people.

28
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:09,922
I'll honor the man you once were, Zod.
Not this monster you've become.

29
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:15,593
Take him away!

30
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:25,863
<i>Sir, is everything all right?</i>
- Out of the way! I said..

31
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:47,087
Get me to Lara.
Jor! Behind you!

32
00:04:50,554 --> 00:04:55,591
Lara, you have to ready the launch,
I will be with you as soon as I can.

33
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:52,401
- Have you seen the codex?
- It's just beneath the central house.

34
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:56,437
<i>But I'm compelled to warn you, reaching
the chambers is class B crime punishable</i>

35
00:05:56,537 --> 00:06:01,040
Nobody cares any more, Keelex!
The world is about to come to an end.

36
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:09,993
Jor-el, by the authority
of General Zod, surrender the codex.

37
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,598
Easy, Harraka.

38
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,948
Did you find the world?

39
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:23,049
We have.

40
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:26,084
<i>Orbiting main sequence yellow star
just as you said.</i>

41
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:31,618
Young star.
His cells would drink its radiation.

42
00:08:34,725 --> 00:08:37,167
It has a seemingly
intelligent population.

43
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,020
He will be an outcast, a freak.

44
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:46,090
They'll kill him.
- How?

45
00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:48,826
He'll be a god to them.

46
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:52,869
What if the ship doesn't make it?

47
00:08:53,297 --> 00:08:55,099
He will die out there.

48
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:57,033
Alone.

49
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,202
I can't do it.

50
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:03,729
I thought I could, but...
now that it's here...

51
00:09:04,398 --> 00:09:09,601
Krypton is doomed.
It's his only chance now.

52
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,711
It's our people's only hope.

53
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:14,022
What is it, Keelex?

54
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:16,596
<i>Five attack ships
converging from the east.</i>

55
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,183
<i>Citadel’s defenses
are being scanned and evaluated.</i>

56
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:21,770
I'll upload the codex.
- No, wait.

57
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:24,117
Lara...

58
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:26,855
Just... let me look at him.

59
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:33,027
I'll never get to see him walk.

60
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:37,496
Never hear him say our names.

61
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,903
Out there amongst the stars...

62
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:50,173
he will live.

63
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:49,585
Goodbye, my son.

64
00:10:49,596 --> 00:10:51,916
I hope some dreams
travel with you.

65
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,719
Concentrate fire on the main door.

66
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:51,791
<i>Lady Lara, the phantom drives
are coming on-line</i>

67
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,616
Proceed to ignition.

68
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:58,637
We have identified an engine ignition
within the citadel.

69
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,987
A launch...

70
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,342
Hold this platform, Commander.

71
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:22,589
I know you stole the codex, Jor-el.
Surrender it and I'll let you live.

72
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:26,557
This is a second change
for all of Krypton,

73
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:29,335
not just the bloodlines
you deem worthy.

74
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:34,565
- What have you done?
- We've had a child, Zod.

75
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:36,633
A boy child.

76
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,869
Krypton's first natural
birth in centuries.

77
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:45,140
And he will be free.
Free to forge his own destiny.

78
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,641
Heresy!

79
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:50,710
Destroy it!

80
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:46,678
Lara, listen to me!

81
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:49,722
The Codex is Krypton's future.

82
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:52,390
Abort the launch!

83
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:48,900
Your son, Lara...
Where have you sent him?

84
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:55,142
His name is Kal.

85
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:57,440
Son of El.

86
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:03,939
And he is beyond your reach.

87
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:16,354
Bring that ship down.

88
00:15:22,826 --> 00:15:24,327
<i>Target locked.</i>

89
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:40,039
Lay down your weapons,
your forces are surrounded.

90
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,444
General Zod, for the crimes
of murder and high treason,

91
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:59,286
the Council has sentenced you
and your fellow insurgents

92
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:03,438
to 300 hundred cycles
of somatic reconditioning.

93
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:06,659
Do you have any last words?

94
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:12,568
You won't kill us yourself!
You wouldn't sully your hands,

95
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:16,100
but you'll damn us
to a black hole for eternity.

96
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,271
Jor-El, was right
you are a pack of fools,

97
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:23,906
every last one of you!

98
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:26,174
And you...

99
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:29,910
You believe your son is safe?

100
00:16:30,244 --> 00:16:31,611
I will find him.

101
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,348
I will reclaim what
you have taken from us.

102
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:39,316
I will find him.

103
00:16:40,652 --> 00:16:43,054
I will find him, Lara.

104
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:48,158
I will find him!

105
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:32,953
<i>Lady Lara,
shouldn't you find refuge?</i>

106
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,913
There is no refuge, Kelor.

107
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:39,743
Jor-El was right,

108
00:18:41,443 --> 00:18:45,346
this is the end.

109
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:59,124
Make a better world than ours, Kal.

110
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:33,962
Watch it, dumbass! Keep your eyes open
or you are gonna get squashed!

111
00:20:35,997 --> 00:20:39,834
Where the hell
did they find you, greenhorn?

112
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,327
Gentlemen, secure the deck!

113
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:45,863
We just got a distress call
from a rig due west of us.

114
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:48,167
Secure the deck!

115
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,879
All civilian folk, stand clear,

116
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,453
the sub-sea valve's failed
and the rig is about to explode.

117
00:20:56,461 --> 00:20:59,120
Roger, coast guard. What about
the men left inside, over.

118
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:03,218
- Forget them, they are dead!
- Greenhorn, fetch me my binoculars.

119
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:06,987
Greenhorn!

120
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,782
This is the last of the oxygen!

121
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:19,178
I don't know how much longer
we can hold out!

122
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:29,931
This is coast guard 65-10.

123
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:32,882
We're gonna make one more pass
and then we're getting out of here.

124
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:38,078
Wait, wait,
I've got some guys on the heli-pad!

125
00:21:57,693 --> 00:22:00,342
Get that last guy rolling,
we have got to go!

126
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:02,655
Hey, let’s go!
What are you doing!

127
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:50,073
When Kansas became a territory...

128
00:22:51,627 --> 00:22:53,627
Clark!

129
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:56,688
Are you listening, Clark?

130
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:03,650
I asked if you could tell me
who were the first settlers of Kansas?

131
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,356
Are you alright, Clark?

132
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:28,601
Clark!

133
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,113
Clark!

134
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,139
- Clark, come out of there!
- Leave me alone.

135
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:44,507
Clark, I have called your mother.

136
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:52,900
I'm here!
Clark, honey, what's wrong?

137
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:58,007
Will you open the door?
- What's wrong with him, anyway?

138
00:23:58,032 --> 00:23:59,832
- He's such a weirdo!
- Crybaby!

139
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:02,357
His parents won't even
let him play with other kids.

140
00:24:02,385 --> 00:24:03,939
I know.

141
00:24:04,037 --> 00:24:07,740
Sweetie! How can I help you
if you won't let me in?

142
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:11,083
The world is too big, mom.

143
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:13,104
Then make it smaller.

144
00:24:15,025 --> 00:24:17,025
Just...

145
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:21,336
Focus on my voice.

146
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,627
Pretend it's an island.

147
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:27,391
Out in the ocean.

148
00:24:28,203 --> 00:24:30,403
Can you see it?

149
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:34,698
I see it.

150
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,749
Then swim towards it, honey.

151
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:53,185
What's wrong with me, mom?

152
00:24:55,443 --> 00:24:57,443
Clark...

153
00:26:20,627 --> 00:26:24,135
Hey, asswipe! What do you think,
did you see the game?

154
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:27,898
Leave him alone, Pete.
- What are you, his girlfriend?

155
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:30,156
I want hear what he has to say.

156
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:33,488
Come on, dick splash.

157
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,881
My son was there, he was in the bus.

158
00:28:17,373 --> 00:28:19,575
He saw what Clark did.

159
00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:23,511
I know he did. I'm sure
that what he thought he saw...

160
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:25,895
Was an act of God, Jonathan!

161
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,598
This was providence!

162
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:35,360
Well, I think you're blowing it
a little out of proportion.

163
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:37,052
No, I'm not.

164
00:28:37,097 --> 00:28:39,599
Lana saw it too and the Forny boy.

165
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:43,435
And this isn't the first time
Clark's done something like this.

166
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,184
- I just wanted to help.
- I know you did, but we talked about this,

167
00:29:03,716 --> 00:29:04,916
Right?

168
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:08,255
Right, we talked about this,
you have...

169
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:12,190
Clark, you have keep
this side of yourself a secret.

170
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:15,894
What was I supposed to do,
just let them die?

171
00:29:21,064 --> 00:29:23,132
Maybe.

172
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:28,736
There's more at stake here than just our
lives and the lives of those around us.

173
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:33,272
When the world...

174
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,943
When the world finds out what you can do
it's going to change everything.

175
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:40,044
Our believes, our notions.

176
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,814
What it means to be human, everything.

177
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:48,918
You saw how Pete's mom reacted, right?
She was scared of you, Clark.

178
00:29:50,686 --> 00:29:52,287
Why?

179
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:56,057
People are afraid
of what they don't understand.

180
00:29:56,157 --> 00:29:58,259
Is she right?

181
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:02,162
Did God give this to me?

182
00:30:02,596 --> 00:30:03,796
Tell me.

183
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:22,411
We found you in this.

184
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:25,746
We were sure that the government
was gonna show up on our doorstep.

185
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,938
No one ever came.

186
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:45,494
This was in the chamber with you.

187
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:49,431
I took it
to a metallurgist at Kansas State.

188
00:30:49,505 --> 00:30:51,876
He said whatever it was made from
didn't even...

189
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,462
It didn't even exist
on the periodic table.

190
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:02,040
It's another way of saying
that it's not from this world, Clark.

191
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:06,443
And neither are you.

192
00:31:07,524 --> 00:31:09,299
You are the answer, son.

193
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:13,182
You are the answer to
are we alone in the Universe.

194
00:31:13,949 --> 00:31:15,250
I don't wanna be.

195
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,252
And I don't blame you son.

196
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:21,523
Be huge burden for anyone to bear,
but you are not just anyone, Clark.

197
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:24,303
And I have to believe
that you were,

198
00:31:24,964 --> 00:31:27,417
that you were send here for an reason.

199
00:31:28,694 --> 00:31:31,396
All these changes that
you're going through, one day,

200
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:33,564
one day you're gonna think of them
as a blessing.

201
00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:36,134
When that day comes,
you'll have to make a choice,

202
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:40,937
choice of whether to stand proud
in front of the human race or not..

203
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:45,340
Can't I just
keep pretending I'm your son?

204
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:48,142
You are my son.

205
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:55,981
But somewhere out there,
you have another father too.

206
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:57,782
Who gave you another name.

207
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:04,354
And he send you here
for a reason, Clark.

208
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:07,818
And even if it takes you
the rest of your life,

209
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:10,616
you owe it to yourself
to find out what that reason is.

210
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,144
They did find something strange in...

211
00:32:36,936 --> 00:32:40,636
I know, it's crazy, right?
The Americans are there too.

212
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:41,354
Lots of them.

213
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:44,439
They are calling it anomalous object,
whatever that means.

214
00:32:44,486 --> 00:32:46,888
Back off rebel, I'm serious.
Oh come on, Chrissy.

215
00:32:47,855 --> 00:32:49,819
- Knock it off!
- Sit down.

216
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:53,854
- Let me go!
- Hey, leave her alone, man.

217
00:32:56,515 --> 00:32:58,706
Or what, tough guy?

218
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,267
Or... I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

219
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:07,444
I think I'll probably just leave
when I'm good and ready.

220
00:33:16,275 --> 00:33:18,477
O, there he is.

221
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:28,385
It's not worth it, sweetie.

222
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:39,461
Hey, asshole, don't forget your tip.

223
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:34,136
Thanks,

224
00:34:34,423 --> 00:34:35,823
Hi.

225
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,904
Miss Lane, how are you doing?

226
00:34:38,405 --> 00:34:42,975
- Jed Eubanks, Arctic cargo.
- How far to the station?

227
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:45,911
Camp is just over the rise,
I'll walk you over. - Great.

228
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,483
- Help her out.
- Careful with those, they are heavy.

229
00:34:55,518 --> 00:35:00,122
I got to confess, Miss Lane,
I'm not a fan of The Daily Planet.

230
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,390
But those you pieces you wrote...

231
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:06,592
Well, they were pretty impressive.

232
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:11,563
Well, what can I say, I get writer's
block if I'm not wearing a flat jacket.

233
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:21,204
Miss Lane!
Hardy, US Northcom, dr. Emil Hamilton.

234
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:25,107
You are early, we were
expecting you tomorrow.

235
00:35:25,174 --> 00:35:27,810
Which I why showed up today.

236
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,612
Look, let’s get one thing straight,
guys, okay?

237
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:33,214
The only reason I'm here
is because we are on Canadian soil,

238
00:35:33,313 --> 00:35:37,016
and the appellate court overruled
your injunction to keep me away.

239
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:40,018
So, if we are done
measuring dicks,

240
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:43,121
can you have your people
show me what you found?

241
00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:48,104
NASA's EOS satellites
pinged the anomaly first,

242
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,674
the ice shelf's plates
held the echo soundings.

243
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,762
But, there is definitely
something down there.

244
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:55,366
- A submarine, maybe Soviet era?
- Doubtful, that's 300 meters,

245
00:35:55,464 --> 00:35:58,267
considerably larger than
anything they build back then.

246
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,800
But here is the spooky part.

247
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:03,903
The ice surrounding the object,

248
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,638
it’s nearly 20,000 years old...

249
00:36:08,907 --> 00:36:12,110
Miss Lane, you are not to wander.

250
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,712
Temperatures drops to
- 40 at night around here.

251
00:36:14,912 --> 00:36:17,213
We couldn't find your
body until after spring.

252
00:36:20,716 --> 00:36:24,353
There you go.

253
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,423
- What if I need to tinkle?
- There's a bucket in the corner.

254
00:37:03,898 --> 00:37:06,467
Where the hell are you going?

255
00:40:51,823 --> 00:40:55,192
It's all right, it's all right..

256
00:41:09,436 --> 00:41:11,702
You are hemorrhaging internally

257
00:41:11,728 --> 00:41:14,432
and if I don't cauterize this bleed...

258
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:19,455
I can do things
that other people can’t.

259
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:21,497
Now hold my hand.

260
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:24,344
This is gonna hurt.

261
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,596
What Colonel Hardy and his team
surmised was a Soviet era submarine,

262
00:42:28,597 --> 00:42:31,499
was actually something much more exotic.

263
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:34,334
An isotope analysis
of the surrounding ice bores,

264
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,969
suggests that an object
had been trapped in the glacier

265
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:39,371
for over 18,000 years.

266
00:42:39,438 --> 00:42:43,708
As for my rescuer, he disappeared
during the object’s departure,

267
00:42:44,142 --> 00:42:49,246
A background check revealed that his work
history and identity had been falsified.

268
00:42:49,279 --> 00:42:53,582
The questions raised by my rescuer's
existence are frightening to contemplate,

269
00:42:53,982 --> 00:42:56,484
but I also know what I saw.

270
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:59,510
And they've arrived
at the inescapable conclusion

271
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,747
that the object
and its occupant,

272
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:04,190
did not originate on Earth..

273
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:08,560
I can’t print this Lois, you might have
hallucinated half of it.

274
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,652
What about the civilian contractors
who corroborated my story?

275
00:43:11,696 --> 00:43:14,265
The Pentagon is denying that
there was a ship.

276
00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:18,317
Of course they are, that's what they
are supposed to do, it’s the Pentagon.

277
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:21,603
Harry come on, it’s me we are talking
about, I'm a Pulitzer winning reporter.

278
00:43:22,003 --> 00:43:24,539
- Then act like it.
- Print it or I walk.

279
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:27,742
You can’t, you are under contract.

280
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:33,780
I'm not running a story about
aliens walking among us...

281
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:41,805
Never going to happen.

282
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,322
That's a Scotch
straight up for the lady.

283
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:49,524
I'm sending you the original article,
my editor won't print it

284
00:43:49,591 --> 00:43:51,493
but, if it happened to leak online...

285
00:43:52,794 --> 00:43:56,263
But, didn't you once
describe my site as a...

286
00:43:56,563 --> 00:44:00,633
- "creeping cancer of falsehoods"?
- I stand by my words, Woodburn.

287
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:03,669
- But I want this story out there.
- Why?

288
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:08,173
Because I want my mystery man
to know I know the truth.

289
00:44:21,682 --> 00:44:26,520
<i>Recursive diagnostics complete.
Guiding process authenticated.</i>

290
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,156
<i>All systems operational.</i>

291
00:44:41,754 --> 00:44:46,258
To see you standing there,
having grown into an adult.

292
00:44:47,959 --> 00:44:52,597
- If only Lara could witness this.
- Who are you?

293
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:55,696
I'm your father, Kal.

294
00:44:56,196 --> 00:45:00,166
Or at least a shadow of him,
his consciousness.

295
00:45:02,134 --> 00:45:05,704
My name is Jor-El.

296
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,307
And Kal?

297
00:45:12,642 --> 00:45:13,843
It’s my name.

298
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:17,312
Kal-El, it is.

299
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:21,461
I have so many questions.

300
00:45:23,496 --> 00:45:29,334
Where do I come from?
Why did you send me here?

301
00:45:29,434 --> 00:45:34,004
You came from Krypton.

302
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:38,974
A world with a much harsher
environment than Earth's.

303
00:45:41,843 --> 00:45:46,080
Long ago, in an era of expansion...

304
00:45:46,138 --> 00:45:49,241
...our race spread out
through the stars,

305
00:45:49,641 --> 00:45:52,443
seeking new worlds to settle upon.

306
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:58,880
This scout ship was one of thousands
launched into the void.

307
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,181
We build outposts on other planets,

308
00:46:02,515 --> 00:46:05,984
using great machines to reshape
environments to our needs.

309
00:46:08,152 --> 00:46:13,657
For 100,000 years,
our civilization flourished,

310
00:46:14,257 --> 00:46:18,861
- accomplishing wonders.
- What happened?

311
00:46:20,496 --> 00:46:24,366
Artificial population control
was established.

312
00:46:24,466 --> 00:46:28,568
The outposts on space exploration
were abandoned,

313
00:46:28,768 --> 00:46:33,205
we exhausted our natural
resources, as a result...

314
00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:37,275
our planet's core became unstable.

315
00:46:38,075 --> 00:46:42,579
Eventually our military
leader, General Zod,

316
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:45,015
attempted a coup,

317
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,878
but by then it was too late.

318
00:46:50,085 --> 00:46:53,021
Your mother and I
foresaw the coming calamity,

319
00:46:53,054 --> 00:46:56,156
and we took certain steps
to ensure your survival.

320
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,159
This is a genesis chamber.

321
00:47:00,259 --> 00:47:03,361
All Kryptonians were conceived
in chambers such as this,

322
00:47:03,461 --> 00:47:07,331
every child was designed to fulfill
a predetermined role in our society,

323
00:47:07,598 --> 00:47:11,405
as a worker, a warrior,
a leader, and so on.

324
00:47:12,102 --> 00:47:15,838
Your mother and I believed that
Krypton had lost something precious,

325
00:47:15,905 --> 00:47:18,440
the element of choice, of chance.

326
00:47:18,442 --> 00:47:21,232
What if a child dreamed
of becoming something other

327
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:23,403
than what society
had intended for him or her?

328
00:47:24,677 --> 00:47:28,080
What if a child aspired
to something greater?

329
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,226
You were the embodiment
of that belief, Kal.

330
00:47:30,299 --> 00:47:32,923
Krypton's first natural birth
in centuries.

331
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:37,321
That's why we risked
so much to save you.

332
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,123
Why didn't you come with me?

333
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:45,627
We couldn't, Kal.

334
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,131
No matter how much we wanted to,

335
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:50,864
no matter how much we loved you...

336
00:47:51,364 --> 00:47:52,765
Your mother Lara and I

337
00:47:52,857 --> 00:47:56,026
were a product of the failures
of our world as much Zod was,

338
00:47:56,113 --> 00:47:58,063
tied to its fate.

339
00:47:58,203 --> 00:48:00,341
- So, I'm alone.
- No.

340
00:48:01,806 --> 00:48:05,509
You are much as a child of Earth now
as you are of Krypton.

341
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:09,145
You can embody
the best of both worlds.

342
00:48:09,478 --> 00:48:12,781
A dream your mother and I
dedicated our lives to preserve.

343
00:48:17,585 --> 00:48:20,653
The people of Earth are different
from us, it’s true.

344
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:23,611
But ultimately I believe
that is a good thing.

345
00:48:23,644 --> 00:48:26,747
They won't necessarily make
the same mistakes we did.

346
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:29,051
Not if you guide them, Kal.

347
00:48:30,417 --> 00:48:32,718
Not if you give them hope.

348
00:48:35,474 --> 00:48:37,776
That is what this symbol means.

349
00:48:38,423 --> 00:48:41,025
The symbol of the House of El
means "hope".

350
00:48:41,035 --> 00:48:43,437
Embodied within the hope
is the fundamental belief,

351
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:46,998
the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

352
00:48:48,575 --> 00:48:51,878
That's what you can bring them.

353
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,827
Why am I so different from them?

354
00:49:14,061 --> 00:49:17,864
Earth's sun is younger and
brighter than Krypton’s was.

355
00:49:18,431 --> 00:49:20,544
Your cells
have drunk in its radiation,

356
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,363
strengthening your muscles,
your skin, your senses.

357
00:49:25,704 --> 00:49:30,675
Earth's gravity is weaker,
yet its atmosphere is more nourishing,

358
00:49:30,741 --> 00:49:33,944
You've grown stronger here
than I ever could've imagined.

359
00:49:34,177 --> 00:49:36,379
The only way to know how strong,

360
00:49:36,546 --> 00:49:42,183
is to keep testing your limits.

361
00:50:31,968 --> 00:50:35,871
You will give the people of Earth
an ideal to strive towards.

362
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:42,367
They will race behind you,
they will stumble, they will fall.

363
00:50:42,493 --> 00:50:44,495
But in time...

364
00:50:45,629 --> 00:50:48,632
they will join you
when the sun comes.

365
00:50:49,766 --> 00:50:54,470
In time, you will help them
accomplish wonders.

366
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:21,280
How do you find someone who has
spent a lifetime covering his tracks?

367
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:24,448
You start with the urban legends
that have sprung up in his wake.

368
00:52:24,515 --> 00:52:27,717
All of the friends of a friend
who claim to have seen him.

369
00:52:28,785 --> 00:52:31,186
For some, he was a guardian angel.

370
00:52:31,687 --> 00:52:35,690
For others a cypher,
a ghost who never quite fit in.

371
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:41,996
As you work your way back in time,
the stories begin to form a pattern.

372
00:52:42,804 --> 00:52:44,885
I'm looking for a Pete Ross,
do you know him?

373
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,933
Yes, he works at the I-Hop.

374
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:48,617
You go down the road...

375
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:51,830
Pete Ross?

376
00:52:53,127 --> 00:52:56,330
I'd like to talk to you about an accident
that occurred when you were younger,

377
00:52:56,363 --> 00:52:59,365
a school bus
that went into the river?

378
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:06,228
Rusty!

379
00:53:06,871 --> 00:53:11,709
Mrs. Kent, I'm Lois Lane
from The Daily Planet.

380
00:53:11,757 --> 00:53:13,757
Quiet!

381
00:53:13,977 --> 00:53:17,580
I'm from The Daily Planet and I'd like
to talk to you about your son.

382
00:53:44,993 --> 00:53:49,662
Where are you from, what are you
doing here, let me tell your story.

383
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:55,398
- What if I don't want my story told?
- It’s going to come out eventually.

384
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:58,222
Somebody’s going to get a photograph
or figure out where you live.

385
00:53:58,522 --> 00:54:00,123
Then I’ll just disappear again.

386
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:03,359
The only way you can disappear for good
is to stop helping people altogether,

387
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:06,163
and I sense
that's not option for you.

388
00:54:09,898 --> 00:54:11,966
My father believed...

389
00:54:12,066 --> 00:54:14,967
...that if the world found out
who I really was...

390
00:54:16,168 --> 00:54:18,910
they'd reject me, out of fear.

391
00:54:21,406 --> 00:54:23,507
I'm tired of safe!

392
00:54:23,574 --> 00:54:25,376
I just want do something
useful with my life.

393
00:54:25,442 --> 00:54:28,344
So farming, feeding people,
that's not useful?

394
00:54:28,438 --> 00:54:29,838
I didn't say that.

395
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:32,465
Our family has been farming
for 5 generations, Clark.

396
00:54:32,498 --> 00:54:34,123
Your family. Not mine.

397
00:54:34,221 --> 00:54:37,089
I don't know even why I'm listening
to you, you are not my dad,

398
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,920
you are just some guy who
found me in the field.

399
00:54:38,931 --> 00:54:40,232
Clark!

400
00:54:42,722 --> 00:54:45,090
That's all right, Martha.

401
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:48,893
He is right, Clark has a point.

402
00:54:49,093 --> 00:54:51,662
We are not your parents.

403
00:54:52,063 --> 00:54:53,956
But we've been doing
the best we can,

404
00:54:53,982 --> 00:54:56,024
and we've been
making it up as we go along,

405
00:54:56,099 --> 00:55:01,170
so maybe... maybe our best
isn't good enough anymore.

406
00:55:05,073 --> 00:55:06,507
Look...

407
00:55:06,608 --> 00:55:08,748
- Dad, please...
- Hold on.

408
00:55:28,424 --> 00:55:31,126
Go for the overpass.

409
00:55:32,127 --> 00:55:33,828
Go for the overpass!

410
00:55:35,295 --> 00:55:36,596
Take cover! Take cover!

411
00:55:37,297 --> 00:55:39,198
Over there, just follow them!

412
00:55:43,602 --> 00:55:44,903
She's stuck!

413
00:55:46,738 --> 00:55:48,439
You guys follow me.

414
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:50,941
The dog's in the car!

415
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:55,711
I get him!

416
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:58,714
Get your mom to the overpass.

417
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,789
- Jonathan!
- It's okay!

418
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:51,620
- Jonathan!
- Ma, stay here.

419
00:57:17,148 --> 00:57:19,148
Dad!

420
00:57:22,144 --> 00:57:25,045
I let my father die,
because I trusted him.

421
00:57:26,146 --> 00:57:29,949
Because he was convinced
that I had to wait.

422
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:33,352
That the world was not ready.

423
00:57:34,753 --> 00:57:37,455
What do you think?

424
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:43,260
You better watch out Lois.

425
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,183
Hey, Perry's gunning for you.

426
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:48,663
He knows you are Woodburn’s
anonymous source and he cannot wait...

427
00:57:48,727 --> 00:57:50,727
...to rip you a new one.

428
00:57:55,435 --> 00:57:58,064
I told you not to run with this,
and what do you do?

429
00:57:58,104 --> 00:58:00,806
You let Woodburn just shotgun it
all over the internet!

430
00:58:00,873 --> 00:58:04,142
Now, the publishers want me
to sue you!

431
00:58:04,242 --> 00:58:06,884
Well, if it makes a difference,
I'm dropping it.

432
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,476
- Whoa, just like that?
- Yeah.

433
00:58:10,547 --> 00:58:13,150
- What happened to your leads?
- They didn't pan out.

434
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,665
The story was smoke.

435
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:18,253
Or perhaps it just didn't get
the attraction you hoped it would.

436
00:58:19,186 --> 00:58:22,355
2 weeks leave, no pay -
that's your pennance.

437
00:58:22,356 --> 00:58:25,758
You try something like
this again - you're done here.

438
00:58:26,292 --> 00:58:28,927
No, let’s make it 3 weeks, since you
are so willing to agree with me.

439
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:31,271
No, no, don't.

440
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:34,599
I believe you saw something Lois,

441
00:58:34,632 --> 00:58:37,634
but not for a moment do I believe
that your leads just went cold,

442
00:58:37,701 --> 00:58:41,971
so whatever your reasons
are for dropping it...

443
00:58:42,438 --> 00:58:44,340
I think you're doing
the right thing.

444
00:58:44,507 --> 00:58:45,808
Why?

445
00:58:47,241 --> 00:58:50,678
Can you imagine how people
on this planet would react...

446
00:58:51,578 --> 00:58:52,879
If...

447
00:58:52,979 --> 00:58:57,083
they knew that there was
someone like this out there?

448
00:59:14,562 --> 00:59:16,464
Go get him!

449
00:59:22,102 --> 00:59:24,103
Well, look at you!

450
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:43,017
A reporter came by here.

451
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:45,586
She is a friend, don't worry.

452
00:59:48,955 --> 00:59:49,956
Mom.

453
00:59:50,323 --> 00:59:51,524
What?

454
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:54,660
- I found them.
- Whom?

455
00:59:55,961 --> 00:59:57,762
My parents.

456
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,731
My people.

457
01:00:01,232 --> 01:00:03,935
I know where I come from now.

458
01:00:05,402 --> 01:00:07,403
Wow...

459
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,504
That's wonderful.

460
01:00:11,406 --> 01:00:13,407
I'm so happy for you.

461
01:00:22,615 --> 01:00:25,650
- What?
- Its nothing.

462
01:00:27,952 --> 01:00:31,255
When you were a baby,
I use to lay by your cradle.

463
01:00:31,321 --> 01:00:33,423
Listen to your breath.

464
01:00:34,457 --> 01:00:36,458
It was hard for you.

465
01:00:37,192 --> 01:00:39,193
You struggled.

466
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,357
And I worried all the time.

467
01:00:41,453 --> 01:00:44,158
You worried that the truth
would come out.

468
01:00:44,498 --> 01:00:47,567
No, the truth about you...

469
01:00:48,142 --> 01:00:49,517
...is beautiful.

470
01:00:49,568 --> 01:00:52,571
We saw that, the moment
we laid eyes on you.

471
01:00:55,540 --> 01:01:00,944
We knew that one day,
the whole world would see that.

472
01:01:01,778 --> 01:01:03,579
I'm just…

473
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,042
I'm worried
they’ll take you away from me.

474
01:01:08,282 --> 01:01:10,751
I'm not going anywhere, mom.

475
01:01:12,486 --> 01:01:14,487
I promise.

476
01:01:20,325 --> 01:01:24,128
- General Swanwick, sir.
- What am I looking at, doc?

477
01:01:24,662 --> 01:01:26,663
Comet? Asteroid?

478
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:31,800
Comets don't make
course corrections, General.

479
01:01:34,935 --> 01:01:37,422
I wanted you see this before
some amateur with a telescope

480
01:01:37,445 --> 01:01:39,527
creates a worldwide panic.

481
01:01:40,507 --> 01:01:44,577
The ship appears to have inserted
itself into a lunar synchronous orbit.

482
01:01:44,944 --> 01:01:46,770
Though I have no idea why.

483
01:01:47,353 --> 01:01:50,622
Have you tried...
communicating with it?

484
01:01:50,716 --> 01:01:53,485
Well, they haven't
responded as of yet.

485
01:01:55,552 --> 01:01:57,753
I'm just speculating,

486
01:01:58,254 --> 01:02:00,074
but I think whoever is
at the helm of that thing

487
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,657
is looking to make
a dramatic entrance.

488
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,903
Does anybody know where
we keep the toner cartridges?

489
01:02:11,931 --> 01:02:14,199
- What's going on?
- It’s all over the news.

490
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:16,401
You got to see this.

491
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,660
Clark!

492
01:02:44,737 --> 01:02:46,838
Yeah, coming.

493
01:03:31,601 --> 01:03:33,601
<i>You are not alone.</i>

494
01:03:35,451 --> 01:03:37,753
<i>Yo.. Ar.. No.. Alo...</i>

495
01:03:39,769 --> 01:03:42,238
<i>You are not alone.</i>

496
01:04:15,658 --> 01:04:18,460
- It’s coming in on the RSS feeds.
- <i>You are not alone</i>

497
01:04:19,794 --> 01:04:21,663
It’s on my phone, too.

498
01:04:24,418 --> 01:04:27,220
My name is General Zod.

499
01:04:28,888 --> 01:04:32,791
I come from a world far from yours.

500
01:04:33,091 --> 01:04:38,094
I have journeyed across an ocean
of stars to reach you.

501
01:04:39,162 --> 01:04:43,591
For some time your world
has sheltered one of my citizens.

502
01:04:43,932 --> 01:04:46,234
I request that you return
this individual...

503
01:04:47,201 --> 01:04:48,902
...to my custody.

504
01:04:49,637 --> 01:04:51,474
For reasons unknown,

505
01:04:51,483 --> 01:04:55,439
he has chosen to keep his
existence a secret from you.

506
01:04:56,942 --> 01:05:00,245
He will have made efforts
to blend in.

507
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,881
He will look like you.

508
01:05:02,914 --> 01:05:05,416
But he is not one of you.

509
01:05:06,784 --> 01:05:10,686
To those of you who may know
of his current location:

510
01:05:10,753 --> 01:05:16,375
The fate of your planet
rests in your hands.

511
01:05:17,691 --> 01:05:20,435
To Kal-El, I say this:

512
01:05:22,562 --> 01:05:25,907
Surrender within 24 hours,

513
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:32,428
or watch this world
suffer the consequences.

514
01:05:49,816 --> 01:05:51,782
If he truly means us no harm,

515
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:53,665
then he'll turn himself in
to his people,

516
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,244
and face the consequences
and if he won’t do that,

517
01:05:56,304 --> 01:05:57,805
then maybe we should.

518
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,873
The Daily Planet's Lois Lane
knows who this guys is.

519
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,776
And I think she’s the one
we should be questioning.

520
01:06:02,808 --> 01:06:06,109
Hold-on, you are saying
Lois Lane knows...

521
01:06:06,174 --> 01:06:08,912
Are you watching this crap?
Been running all morning.

522
01:06:09,314 --> 01:06:12,516
For once I actually I agree with
Woodburn. Now, have you seen him?

523
01:06:12,528 --> 01:06:14,897
No, and even I did, I wouldn't say.

524
01:06:14,924 --> 01:06:18,627
The entire world
is being threatened here!

525
01:06:19,486 --> 01:06:22,389
This not the time for you to fall back
on your journalistic integrity!

526
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:28,353
This is serious, Lois! The FBI is here
hurling around words like treason.

527
01:06:28,356 --> 01:06:29,757
I got to go.

528
01:06:46,115 --> 01:06:49,018
FBI, hands up!
Drop the bag, now!

529
01:06:56,333 --> 01:06:59,829
Regarding the visitors themselves,
we know very little at this point.

530
01:06:59,912 --> 01:07:02,112
According to
government officials I've spoken to,

531
01:07:02,133 --> 01:07:04,533
the visitors do not represent a threat,

532
01:07:04,563 --> 01:07:06,963
despite the ominous tone
of their message.

533
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:09,519
Then, of course, there’s
the question on everyone's mind:

534
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,599
Who is this Kal-El person?

535
01:07:11,618 --> 01:07:15,970
Does he actually exist? How could he
have remained hidden for so long?

536
01:07:20,716 --> 01:07:22,717
Come on, Kent.

537
01:07:28,621 --> 01:07:30,322
Come on, fight back!

538
01:07:30,623 --> 01:07:32,624
Get up, Kent.

539
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,761
Is that it?

540
01:07:36,995 --> 01:07:39,097
Is that all you got?

541
01:07:40,086 --> 01:07:42,086
Come on, Kent!

542
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:44,434
Come on!

543
01:08:12,952 --> 01:08:14,754
Did they hurt you?

544
01:08:15,888 --> 01:08:17,189
They can't.

545
01:08:17,322 --> 01:08:19,924
It's not what I meant,
I meant are you all right?

546
01:08:21,136 --> 01:08:23,991
I wanted to hit that kid.
I wanted to hit him so bad!

547
01:08:24,029 --> 01:08:25,530
I know you did, I mean...

548
01:08:26,328 --> 01:08:29,931
Part of me even wanted you to,
but then what?

549
01:08:29,965 --> 01:08:32,367
Would it make you feel any better?

550
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:38,838
You just have to decide what kind of man
you want to grow up to be, because...

551
01:08:38,905 --> 01:08:42,008
whoever that man is -
good character or bad - he is...

552
01:08:43,742 --> 01:08:46,545
He is going to change the world.

553
01:08:51,191 --> 01:08:53,286
What’s on your mind?

554
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:00,351
I don't where to start.

555
01:09:00,388 --> 01:09:02,589
Wherever you want.

556
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:07,193
That ship that appeared last night.

557
01:09:07,427 --> 01:09:11,163
I'm the one they are looking for.

558
01:09:13,799 --> 01:09:15,850
Do you know...

559
01:09:15,876 --> 01:09:18,234
- why they want you?
- No.

560
01:09:18,235 --> 01:09:20,393
But this General Zod,

561
01:09:20,444 --> 01:09:24,590
even if I surrender, there's
no guarantee he'll keep his word.

562
01:09:24,681 --> 01:09:29,518
If there's a chance I can save
Earth by turning myself in...

563
01:09:30,144 --> 01:09:32,146
...shouldn't I take it?

564
01:09:32,913 --> 01:09:34,826
What does your gut tell you?

565
01:09:35,381 --> 01:09:37,883
Zod can’t be trusted.

566
01:09:39,652 --> 01:09:45,155
The problem is... I'm not sure
the people of Earth can be either.

567
01:09:52,828 --> 01:09:56,531
Sometimes you have to take
a leap of faith first,

568
01:09:57,465 --> 01:10:01,235
the trust part comes later.

569
01:10:23,751 --> 01:10:26,353
All right, you got our attention.

570
01:10:26,587 --> 01:10:29,990
- What it is you want?
- I would like to speak to Lois Lane.

571
01:10:30,023 --> 01:10:31,825
What makes you think she's here?

572
01:10:31,969 --> 01:10:36,005
Don't play games with me, General,
I'll surrender.

573
01:10:36,128 --> 01:10:39,630
But only if you guarantee
Lois's freedom.

574
01:10:48,378 --> 01:10:51,314
Why are you surrendering to Zod?

575
01:10:51,678 --> 01:10:55,348
I’m surrendering to mankind,
there is a difference.

576
01:10:56,206 --> 01:10:58,641
You let them handcuff you.

577
01:10:59,112 --> 01:11:02,815
Wouldn't be much of a surrender
if I resisted.

578
01:11:03,115 --> 01:11:08,352
And if it makes them feel more secure,
then all the better for it.

579
01:11:12,522 --> 01:11:16,325
What does the S stand for?

580
01:11:17,091 --> 01:11:19,794
It’s not an a S,

581
01:11:20,013 --> 01:11:22,578
on my world it means “hope”.

582
01:11:23,645 --> 01:11:27,682
Well, here it’s an S.

583
01:11:29,277 --> 01:11:32,412
How about...

584
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,407
Sir, hi.

585
01:11:38,575 --> 01:11:41,977
- My name is doctor...
- Emil Hamilton, I know.

586
01:11:42,344 --> 01:11:44,646
I can see your ID tag
in your breast pocket,

587
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,682
along with a half eaten roll
of Wint-O-Green Life Savers.

588
01:11:47,746 --> 01:11:50,166
And I also see the squad
of soldiers in the next room

589
01:11:50,221 --> 01:11:52,539
preparing that
tranquilizing agent of yours.

590
01:11:52,694 --> 01:11:54,095
You won’t need it.

591
01:11:54,154 --> 01:11:57,757
Sir, you can't expect us
to not take precautions,

592
01:11:57,790 --> 01:12:00,358
you could be carrying
some kind of alien pathogen.

593
01:12:00,425 --> 01:12:03,727
I’ve been here for 33 years, doctor,
haven't infected anyone yet.

594
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,562
That you know of.

595
01:12:05,662 --> 01:12:07,864
We have legitimate
security concerns.

596
01:12:07,897 --> 01:12:10,699
Now you revealed your identity
to Miss Lane over there.

597
01:12:10,766 --> 01:12:13,668
Why won't you do the same with us?

598
01:12:13,702 --> 01:12:16,471
Let’s put our cards
on the table here, General.

599
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:19,907
You are scared of me
because you can't control me.

600
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:22,942
You don't and you never will.

601
01:12:23,443 --> 01:12:25,444
But that doesn't mean
I'm your enemy.

602
01:12:25,511 --> 01:12:28,713
And who is? Zod?

603
01:12:29,347 --> 01:12:33,416
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Be that as it may,

604
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:36,919
I been given orders
to hand you over to him.

605
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,221
Do what you have to do, General.

606
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,040
Thank you.

607
01:12:46,107 --> 01:12:47,408
For what?

608
01:12:48,376 --> 01:12:50,577
For believing in me.

609
01:12:52,879 --> 01:12:55,380
Didn't make much
difference in the end.

610
01:12:55,847 --> 01:12:57,649
It did to me.

611
01:13:17,965 --> 01:13:20,066
They are coming.

612
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:22,089
You should leave now.

613
01:13:24,069 --> 01:13:26,170
Go, Lois.

614
01:14:37,192 --> 01:14:41,695
Kal-El, I'm sub-commander Faora-Ul.

615
01:14:41,795 --> 01:14:45,797
On behalf of General Zod,
I extend you his greetings.

616
01:14:50,635 --> 01:14:53,637
- Are you the ranking officer here?
- I am.

617
01:14:53,737 --> 01:14:58,308
General Zod, would like
this woman to accompany me.

618
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:01,377
You asked for the alien.

619
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:04,312
You didn't say anything
about one of our own.

620
01:15:04,314 --> 01:15:08,217
Shall I tell the general
you are unwilling to comply?

621
01:15:08,449 --> 01:15:11,050
I don't care what you tell him.

622
01:15:13,005 --> 01:15:15,305
It's all right.

623
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:17,222
I'll go.

624
01:15:59,518 --> 01:16:03,588
The atmosphere composition in our ship
is not compatible with humans.

625
01:16:03,688 --> 01:16:08,191
You will need to wear
a breather beyond this point.

626
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,683
Kal-El.

627
01:16:34,865 --> 01:16:39,068
You have no idea how long
we've been searching for you.

628
01:16:39,335 --> 01:16:42,571
- I take it you are Zod.
- General Zod, our Commander!

629
01:16:42,653 --> 01:16:46,732
It's all right, Faora. You can
forgive Kal any lapses in decorum.

630
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:48,976
He is a stranger to our ways.

631
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:51,412
This should be cause for celebration.

632
01:16:52,379 --> 01:16:54,180
Not conflict.

633
01:16:58,084 --> 01:17:00,683
I... feel strange.

634
01:17:03,323 --> 01:17:05,323
Weak...

635
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:10,392
- What's happening to him?
- He is rejecting our ships atmospherics.

636
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:14,104
You've spend a lifetime
adapting to Earth's ecology

637
01:17:14,109 --> 01:17:17,209
- but you never adapted to ours.
- Help him!

638
01:17:17,268 --> 01:17:20,270
I can't. Whatever's happening to him
has to run its course.

639
01:17:22,655 --> 01:17:24,655
Help him!

640
01:17:25,736 --> 01:17:27,735
Help him!

641
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:40,035
Hello, Kal.

642
01:17:42,037 --> 01:17:44,238
Or do you prefer Clark?

643
01:17:44,706 --> 01:17:47,608
That's the name they gave you,
isn't it?

644
01:17:48,876 --> 01:17:53,079
I was Krypton's military leader,
your father - our foremost scientist.

645
01:17:53,179 --> 01:17:57,181
The only thing we agreed on
was that Krypton was dying.

646
01:17:57,248 --> 01:18:00,351
In return for my efforts
to protect our civilization,

647
01:18:01,151 --> 01:18:03,253
and save our planet...

648
01:18:03,319 --> 01:18:06,922
...I and my fellow officers
were sentenced to the Phantom Zone.

649
01:18:10,058 --> 01:18:13,561
And then,
the destruction of our world...

650
01:18:13,661 --> 01:18:15,363
freed us.

651
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,600
We were adrift.

652
01:18:22,868 --> 01:18:27,370
Destined to float among the ruins
of our planet until we starved.

653
01:18:28,939 --> 01:18:31,043
How did you find your way to Earth?

654
01:18:31,241 --> 01:18:35,344
We managed to retro-fit the phantom
projector into a hyper drive.

655
01:18:35,978 --> 01:18:40,381
Your father made similar modification
to the craft that brought your here.

656
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:44,251
And so
the instrument of our damnation...

657
01:18:46,119 --> 01:18:47,621
...became our salvage.

658
01:18:52,824 --> 01:18:57,183
We sought out the old colonial
outposts, looking for signs of life.

659
01:19:00,597 --> 01:19:03,165
But all we found was death.

660
01:19:04,104 --> 01:19:08,477
Cut off from Krypton, these outposts
withered and died long ago.

661
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:11,843
We salvaged what we could:

662
01:19:11,844 --> 01:19:13,878
armor, weapons.

663
01:19:13,978 --> 01:19:15,980
Even a world-engine.

664
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,781
For 33 years we prepared,

665
01:19:20,916 --> 01:19:23,919
until finally
we detected a distress beacon,

666
01:19:23,986 --> 01:19:28,489
which you triggered when
you accessed the ancient scout ship.

667
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:32,092
You lead us here, Kal.

668
01:19:33,526 --> 01:19:37,830
And now it's within your power
to save what remains of your race.

669
01:19:43,534 --> 01:19:46,836
On Krypton, the genetic template
for every being yet to be born,

670
01:19:46,936 --> 01:19:49,338
is encoded
in the registry of citizens.

671
01:19:50,706 --> 01:19:53,298
Your father stole
the registry's codex

672
01:19:53,324 --> 01:19:56,035
and stored it in the capsule
that brought you here.

673
01:19:56,477 --> 01:19:58,279
For what purpose?

674
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:01,881
So that Krypton can live again...

675
01:20:01,948 --> 01:20:03,950
...on Earth.

676
01:20:23,464 --> 01:20:25,566
Where is the codex, Kal?

677
01:20:27,167 --> 01:20:29,409
If Krypton lives again,

678
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:32,171
what happens to Earth?

679
01:20:32,672 --> 01:20:35,396
A foundation
has to be built on something.

680
01:20:36,708 --> 01:20:39,710
Even your father recognized that.

681
01:20:45,639 --> 01:20:47,773
No, Zod.

682
01:20:49,209 --> 01:20:53,345
- I can’t be a part of this.
- Then what can you be a part of?

683
01:20:55,947 --> 01:20:56,948
Stop!

684
01:21:07,554 --> 01:21:11,990
Your father acquitted himself
with honor Kal.

685
01:21:13,558 --> 01:21:17,795
- You killed him?
- I did.

686
01:21:17,895 --> 01:21:22,432
And not a day goes by
where it doesn't haunt me.

687
01:21:22,782 --> 01:21:28,820
But if I had to do it again, I would.
I have a duty to my people.

688
01:21:28,871 --> 01:21:33,974
And I will not allow anyone
to prevent me from carrying it out.

689
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:51,404
What's the setback, Major?

690
01:21:51,521 --> 01:21:53,789
DSP pinged 2 bogeys
launching from the alien ship.

691
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:56,165
- Put it up.
- Yes, sir.

692
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,018
There it is.

693
01:21:58,093 --> 01:22:01,362
Retask I-Com 4, give me
a closer look. - Yes, sir.

694
01:22:01,453 --> 01:22:03,988
Command, word of the day is "Trident".

695
01:22:04,088 --> 01:22:08,155
- We have 2 alien craft on aggressive
approach. - I-Com 4 coming online.

696
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:13,685
- Air speed? - 380 knots, they are
not responding to our hails.

697
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,332
You are wasting your efforts.

698
01:22:17,139 --> 01:22:19,844
The strength you do have from
your exposure to the Earth's sun

699
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:22,145
has been neutralized
aboard our ship.

700
01:22:22,183 --> 01:22:25,208
Here, in this environment,

701
01:22:25,752 --> 01:22:27,753
you're as weak as a human.

702
01:23:25,728 --> 01:23:29,231
- Where did you come from?
- The command key, Miss Lane.

703
01:23:29,598 --> 01:23:32,667
Thanks to you, I'm uploading
into the ships mainframe.

704
01:23:33,434 --> 01:23:36,437
- Who are you?
- I'm Kal's father.

705
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:41,774
- Can you help us?
- I designed this ship.

706
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:46,845
I can modify its atmospheric
composition to human compatibility.

707
01:23:47,449 --> 01:23:50,751
We can stop them, we can send
them back to the phantom zone.

708
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:54,427
- How?
- I can teach you.

709
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:59,088
And in turn, you can teach Kal.
Will you help me?

710
01:24:12,352 --> 01:24:14,852
The ship's crew are alerted.
We need to move quickly.

711
01:24:14,946 --> 01:24:16,946
Retrieve the command key.

712
01:24:24,228 --> 01:24:26,856
- Did you do that?
- Yes. Pick up the sidearm.

713
01:24:36,694 --> 01:24:38,694
What's happening?

714
01:24:59,253 --> 01:25:01,253
To your right, fire!

715
01:25:02,356 --> 01:25:04,356
Behind you!

716
01:25:16,409 --> 01:25:18,909
Secure yourself inside the under pod.

717
01:25:19,428 --> 01:25:21,428
Safe travels, Miss Lane.

718
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:24,549
It's highly unlikely
we'll be seeing each other again.

719
01:25:25,235 --> 01:25:28,365
Remember, the Phantom Drive
is essential for stopping them.

720
01:25:29,498 --> 01:25:31,498
Movie your head to the left.

721
01:25:57,866 --> 01:26:00,960
Is it true
what Zod said about the codex?

722
01:26:00,966 --> 01:26:02,966
Strike that panel.

723
01:26:06,423 --> 01:26:09,394
We wanted you to learn
what it meant to be human first.

724
01:26:10,136 --> 01:26:12,802
So that one day,
when the time was right,

725
01:26:12,993 --> 01:26:16,254
you could be the bridge
between two peoples.

726
01:26:18,698 --> 01:26:20,698
Look.

727
01:26:22,626 --> 01:26:24,426
Lois.

728
01:26:24,503 --> 01:26:26,803
You can save her, Kal.

729
01:26:28,651 --> 01:26:31,051
You can save all of them.

730
01:27:49,344 --> 01:27:52,047
You will be safe here.

731
01:27:53,247 --> 01:27:57,049
- Are you all right?
- Oh yeah.

732
01:27:59,184 --> 01:28:02,884
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna tell them
anything about you,

733
01:28:02,967 --> 01:28:05,333
but they did something to me,
they looked inside my mind...

734
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:08,082
It's okay, Lois.
They did the same thing to me.

735
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:23,628
Clark!

736
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:35,944
The craft he arrived in,
where is it?

737
01:28:37,446 --> 01:28:39,948
Go to hell.

738
01:28:49,922 --> 01:28:51,923
There.

739
01:29:22,624 --> 01:29:23,925
Where has he hidden it?

740
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:25,259
I don't know.

741
01:29:25,326 --> 01:29:27,427
Where is the Codex?!

742
01:29:41,526 --> 01:29:43,787
You think
you can threaten my mother?!

743
01:30:25,538 --> 01:30:27,140
What have you done to me?

744
01:30:27,142 --> 01:30:31,145
My parents taught me
to hone my senses, Zod.

745
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,179
To focus...

746
01:30:35,213 --> 01:30:37,241
...on just what I wanted to see.

747
01:30:37,298 --> 01:30:40,471
Without your helmet,
you are getting everything.

748
01:30:41,150 --> 01:30:44,653
And its hurts, doesn't it?

749
01:31:33,824 --> 01:31:36,025
Get inside, it’s not safe.

750
01:31:40,304 --> 01:31:43,374
All clear, this is Guardian,
I'm airborne mission commander.

751
01:31:43,607 --> 01:31:46,104
I have previously encountered
and observed

752
01:31:46,107 --> 01:31:48,788
the beings we are about
to engage at close proximity,

753
01:31:48,844 --> 01:31:52,748
they are extremely dangerous,
we are authorized to use deadly force.

754
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:57,611
Roger, Guardian,
we're inbound to target.

755
01:32:02,827 --> 01:32:06,266
- We're hot, weapons free.
- Copy One-One, weapons free.

756
01:32:08,978 --> 01:32:11,822
Thunder One-One,
tally three targets.

757
01:32:28,139 --> 01:32:31,441
Thunder One-One, good hit,
request immediate re-attack.

758
01:32:31,723 --> 01:32:36,590
Roger, Guardian, we'll make a second
gun run ahead of you 2-1-2-3.

759
01:32:43,489 --> 01:32:45,691
Thunder One-One, eject, eject!

760
01:32:46,185 --> 01:32:48,185
Thunder One-One, eject!

761
01:32:58,364 --> 01:33:00,832
I have a bogey incoming!

762
01:33:20,266 --> 01:33:22,768
You are weak, son of El.

763
01:33:22,785 --> 01:33:24,784
Unsure of yourself.

764
01:33:29,226 --> 01:33:33,830
The fact that you posses
a sense of morality and we do not...

765
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:37,332
...gives us
an evolutionary advantage.

766
01:33:40,408 --> 01:33:42,623
And if history has proven anything...

767
01:33:52,644 --> 01:33:56,347
it is that the evolution always wins.

768
01:35:02,892 --> 01:35:05,660
All Rangers,
I need you engage the targets.

769
01:35:05,725 --> 01:35:08,628
Guardian, this is Battle Zero One,
what about that guy in blue?

770
01:35:08,722 --> 01:35:11,324
I said, engage all targets!

771
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:24,290
Contact, contact!

772
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:35,411
Are you okay?

773
01:35:40,182 --> 01:35:42,182
We're going in hard!

774
01:35:42,983 --> 01:35:44,685
Brace for impact!

775
01:35:44,807 --> 01:35:47,624
Brace for impact,
we're going in hard!

776
01:35:51,985 --> 01:35:54,098
Fallen Angel, Fallen Angel,
Guardian is down.

777
01:35:54,127 --> 01:35:56,217
I repeat, Guardian is down!

778
01:36:18,325 --> 01:36:22,227
Thunder One-Two calling Guardian,
Guardian, do you read?

779
01:36:22,248 --> 01:36:27,552
I want you to put down everything you got
at my position, this will be danger close.

780
01:36:27,584 --> 01:36:29,986
Copy, danger close.
Good luck, sir.

781
01:37:10,847 --> 01:37:15,284
A good death is its own reward.

782
01:37:27,293 --> 01:37:29,495
You will not win,

783
01:37:29,962 --> 01:37:33,798
for every human you save,
we will kill a million more.

784
01:38:25,774 --> 01:38:28,596
We have an "All clear"?
Do we have an "All clear"?

785
01:38:28,852 --> 01:38:32,851
Alfa Team, stand fast.
Alfa Team, do you copy?

786
01:39:22,574 --> 01:39:24,574
This man is not our enemy.

787
01:39:27,099 --> 01:39:29,099
Thank you, Colonel.

788
01:39:46,776 --> 01:39:48,776
Mom?

789
01:39:48,801 --> 01:39:50,801
I'm alright!

790
01:40:02,482 --> 01:40:04,482
Nice suit, son.

791
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,504
I'm sorry.

792
01:40:07,743 --> 01:40:09,743
It's only stuff, Clark.

793
01:40:11,312 --> 01:40:13,712
It can always be replaced.

794
01:40:16,037 --> 01:40:18,037
But you can't be.

795
01:40:18,622 --> 01:40:20,122
Mom...

796
01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:23,791
Zod said this Codex he's looking for
can actually bring my people back.

797
01:40:24,007 --> 01:40:26,007
Isn't that a good thing?

798
01:40:29,891 --> 01:40:32,962
I don't think they're interested
in sharing this world.

799
01:40:32,963 --> 01:40:34,872
Clark!

800
01:40:37,697 --> 01:40:40,144
I know how to stop them.

801
01:40:41,666 --> 01:40:46,970
- What happened down there?
- He exposed a temporary weakness.

802
01:40:47,070 --> 01:40:52,708
It is of little consequence,
because I have located the codex.

803
01:40:53,842 --> 01:40:56,745
It was never in the capsule.

804
01:40:56,845 --> 01:41:00,648
Jor-el took the codex,
the DNA of an billion people..

805
01:41:00,948 --> 01:41:04,317
And he bonded it with
his sons individual cells,

806
01:41:04,418 --> 01:41:09,654
all Krypton's heirs,
living hidden in one refugee's body.

807
01:41:14,091 --> 01:41:19,829
Does Kal-el need to be alive, for us
to extract the codex from his cells?

808
01:41:20,730 --> 01:41:23,865
No.

809
01:41:27,835 --> 01:41:30,136
Released the world-engine.

810
01:42:02,262 --> 01:42:03,329
What did just happen?

811
01:42:03,363 --> 01:42:05,663
The ships just split in 2,
track 1 is heading east,

812
01:42:05,730 --> 01:42:08,032
track 2 is deploying towards
the Southern Hemisphere.

813
01:42:08,065 --> 01:42:12,402
- How fast is that bogey moving?
- Approaching Mach 24 and accelerating.

814
01:42:12,435 --> 01:42:16,605
Looks like it’s going to impact
somewhere in the South Indian Ocean.

815
01:42:34,185 --> 01:42:38,489
- The rest of the ship is descending.
- Put it on the board now.

816
01:42:39,323 --> 01:42:42,826
Oh my God!

817
01:43:21,322 --> 01:43:24,825
Bring the phantom drive on-line!

818
01:43:46,207 --> 01:43:48,898
We are now slaved to the world engine.

819
01:43:49,477 --> 01:43:51,578
Initiate.

820
01:44:24,202 --> 01:44:26,804
What have they hit us with?

821
01:44:26,838 --> 01:44:32,309
Looks like some kind of gravity weapon,
its working in tandem with their ship.

822
01:44:32,609 --> 01:44:35,261
Somehow they are
increasing the Earth's mass,

823
01:44:35,323 --> 01:44:38,241
clouding the atmosphere
with particulates.

824
01:44:39,414 --> 01:44:41,483
Oh my God!

825
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:44,352
They are Terra-forming.

826
01:44:44,385 --> 01:44:45,986
What's that?

827
01:44:46,086 --> 01:44:49,722
Planetary engineering modifying
Earth's atmosphere and topography.

828
01:44:49,822 --> 01:44:52,624
And turning Earth into Krypton.

829
01:44:52,724 --> 01:44:55,459
- But what happen to us?
- Based on these readings,

830
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:58,162
there won’t be an us.

831
01:44:58,295 --> 01:45:00,723
General Swanwick, sir.
I'm on with the control tower,

832
01:45:00,822 --> 01:45:03,668
Colonel Hardy is on his way in
and he got Superman in tow.

833
01:45:04,133 --> 01:45:05,801
Superman?

834
01:45:05,868 --> 01:45:09,270
The alien, sir. That's what
they're calling him, Superman.

835
01:45:15,007 --> 01:45:18,544
- We have a plan, General.
- Is that what I think it is?

836
01:45:19,077 --> 01:45:20,679
It's the ship he arrived in.

837
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:25,216
This ship is run by something
called a phantom-drive.

838
01:45:25,316 --> 01:45:28,980
Its bends space. Zod's ship
uses the same technology.

839
01:45:29,006 --> 01:45:31,779
If we can make the two drives
collide with one another...

840
01:45:31,787 --> 01:45:34,189
- A singularity could be created.
- Like a black hole.

841
01:45:34,203 --> 01:45:36,803
Yes. So if you open up this doorway,

842
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:38,902
then theoretically
they should be pulled back in.

843
01:45:38,993 --> 01:45:41,395
So, you want us bomb them with that?

844
01:45:41,428 --> 01:45:45,051
General, if that craft
maxes at 17,000 pounds,

845
01:45:45,077 --> 01:45:48,569
we can drop it from a C-17.
It’s a viable plan.

846
01:45:48,604 --> 01:45:51,306
And if I don't stop that machine
over the Indian Ocean,

847
01:45:51,369 --> 01:45:54,438
the gravity field
will continue to expand.

848
01:46:00,109 --> 01:46:03,745
If that thing is making Earth
more like Krypton,

849
01:46:03,747 --> 01:46:06,249
would you be weaker around it?

850
01:46:06,447 --> 01:46:11,984
Maybe, but I'm not gonna let that
stop me from trying.

851
01:46:12,084 --> 01:46:15,587
You may want
to step back a little bit.

852
01:46:16,354 --> 01:46:19,824
Maybe a little bit more.

853
01:46:50,099 --> 01:46:53,288
Faora! Take command.
- Yes, sir.

854
01:46:53,358 --> 01:46:56,692
I need to secure
the Genesis chamber,

855
01:46:56,789 --> 01:46:59,592
and pay my respects
to an old friend.

856
01:47:06,893 --> 01:47:11,128
Guardian en route to Metropolis.
Package in tow.

857
01:48:06,038 --> 01:48:10,608
<i>Command key accepted
Genesis chamber coming on-line, sir.</i>

858
01:48:10,708 --> 01:48:14,211
Stop this, Zod,
while there still time.

859
01:48:15,634 --> 01:48:19,303
Haven't giving up lecturing me
have you, even in death.

860
01:48:19,403 --> 01:48:21,272
I will not let you use
the codex like this.

861
01:48:21,338 --> 01:48:23,407
You don't have
the power to stop me.

862
01:48:23,473 --> 01:48:26,908
The command key I have entered
is revoking your authority,

863
01:48:26,942 --> 01:48:29,444
this ship is now under my control.

864
01:49:01,235 --> 01:49:04,285
North Com, Lightning 1. Request
permission to unleash the hounds.

865
01:49:04,604 --> 01:49:06,606
North Com, Lightning 1,
you are clear to engage.

866
01:49:06,673 --> 01:49:09,908
Send battle damage
assessment when able, out.

867
01:49:22,566 --> 01:49:24,366
Avionics are going haywire,

868
01:49:24,459 --> 01:49:27,817
the gravity field is pulling our
missiles down, we got to get closer!

869
01:49:32,792 --> 01:49:37,630
All right everybody, we are leaving,
we're leaving the building now!

870
01:49:59,954 --> 01:50:01,954
We've lost our wingman!

871
01:50:03,755 --> 01:50:05,755
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

872
01:50:16,375 --> 01:50:18,975
Everybody, this way! Come on!

873
01:50:19,112 --> 01:50:23,382
Everybody, go!
Keep moving, keep moving!

874
01:50:48,283 --> 01:50:50,651
Our people can co-exist.

875
01:50:50,718 --> 01:50:54,421
So we can suffer through years of
pain trying to adapt like your son has?

876
01:50:54,454 --> 01:50:56,956
You are talking about genocide.

877
01:50:56,957 --> 01:50:59,960
Yes, and I'm arguing
its merits with a ghost.

878
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:04,896
We are both ghosts, Zod,
can't you see that?

879
01:51:04,997 --> 01:51:06,999
The Krypton you're clinging on to
is gone.

880
01:51:07,014 --> 01:51:10,313
Ship, have you managed to quarantine
this invasive intelligence?

881
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,600
- I have.
- Then prepare to terminate it,

882
01:51:12,690 --> 01:51:16,574
- I'm tired of this debate.
- Silencing me won't change anything.

883
01:51:18,406 --> 01:51:20,427
My son...

884
01:51:20,803 --> 01:51:23,532
...is twice the man you were.

885
01:51:24,423 --> 01:51:26,391
And he will finish what we started.

886
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:30,400
I can promise you that.

887
01:51:33,590 --> 01:51:39,761
Tell me, you have Jor-El's
memories, his conscience.

888
01:51:39,794 --> 01:51:43,730
Can you experience his pain?

889
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:48,134
I will harvest the codex
from your son's corps.

890
01:51:48,234 --> 01:51:53,872
And I will rebuild Krypton,
atop his bones.

891
01:52:50,448 --> 01:52:53,584
Jenny, where are you!

892
01:52:53,667 --> 01:52:57,250
- I'm here!
- Hold on, hold on.

893
01:52:59,055 --> 01:53:00,589
I can't get free, I'm stuck.

894
01:53:00,622 --> 01:53:02,724
We get you out there, all-right.
Just sit tight.

895
01:53:03,527 --> 01:53:06,428
- No, no! Please don't leave me!
- I'm not gonna leave you.

896
01:53:07,094 --> 01:53:10,096
Robert, get your ass
over here and help me!

897
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:17,002
Try this.

898
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:26,221
It's getting closer!
Come on, push!

899
01:53:27,646 --> 01:53:30,148
North Com, this is Guardian,
are we clear to make the drop?

900
01:53:30,979 --> 01:53:32,947
Negative, Guardian.

901
01:54:50,906 --> 01:54:52,907
He did it.

902
01:54:54,842 --> 01:54:58,343
Northcom, this is Guardian, we're passing
the phase line, we're good to go.

903
01:54:58,345 --> 01:55:01,949
Godspeed, Guardian. Arm the package.
You are cleared hot.

904
01:55:02,282 --> 01:55:05,184
We are lining up
for the final run.

905
01:55:05,251 --> 01:55:08,153
It’s up to you and Hamilton now.

906
01:55:46,695 --> 01:55:49,692
- Are you planning on getting me in?
- Load master, is the package armed?

907
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:51,942
- You know we're ready to drop.
- Negative.

908
01:55:52,254 --> 01:55:54,456
There is something wrong,
it’s not supposed to do this.

909
01:55:54,489 --> 01:55:58,225
- What is it supposed to do?
- It's supposed to go in all the way.

910
01:55:58,303 --> 01:56:01,305
- Let me take a look.
- Co-pilot's aircraft.

911
01:56:02,031 --> 01:56:04,031
Co-pilot's aircraft.

912
01:56:10,315 --> 01:56:12,915
We are lined up for the drop,
what's the hold up?

913
01:56:13,056 --> 01:56:15,056
We have a slight set-back.

914
01:56:30,154 --> 01:56:32,390
Target that aircraft!

915
01:56:35,191 --> 01:56:36,992
<i>Target locked.</i>

916
01:56:46,648 --> 01:56:49,849
- Zod!
- If you destroy this ship...

917
01:56:50,135 --> 01:56:52,537
...you destroy Krypton.

918
01:56:55,673 --> 01:56:58,075
Krypton had its chance!

919
01:59:53,041 --> 01:59:55,376
Are they gone?

920
01:59:55,878 --> 01:59:57,997
I think so.

921
01:59:59,046 --> 02:00:00,583
He saved us.

922
02:00:25,999 --> 02:00:29,948
You know they say it's all
downhill after the first kiss.

923
02:00:32,404 --> 02:00:36,552
I'm pretty sure it only counts
when you're kissing a human.

924
02:01:04,796 --> 02:01:08,365
Look at this...

925
02:01:08,466 --> 02:01:12,601
We could have built a new Krypton
in this squalor.

926
02:01:12,701 --> 02:01:17,138
But you chose the humans over us.

927
02:01:17,238 --> 02:01:21,610
I exist only to protect Krypton...

928
02:01:23,192 --> 02:01:27,380
That is the sole purpose
for which I was born,

929
02:01:28,497 --> 02:01:32,934
and every action I take,
no matter how violent,

930
02:01:33,034 --> 02:01:38,405
or how cruel,
is for the greater good...

931
02:01:38,505 --> 02:01:40,708
...of my people.

932
02:01:44,842 --> 02:01:49,045
And now I have no people.

933
02:01:52,315 --> 02:01:55,551
My soul...

934
02:01:55,651 --> 02:02:00,855
that is what you have taken from me!

935
02:02:08,326 --> 02:02:12,463
I'm going to make them suffer, Kal,
these humans you've adopted.

936
02:02:12,563 --> 02:02:15,589
I will take them all from you,
one by one.

937
02:02:15,621 --> 02:02:17,331
You are a monster, Zod.

938
02:02:20,136 --> 02:02:22,872
And I'm gonna stop you.

939
02:04:02,914 --> 02:04:08,952
There is only one way this ends, Kal!
Either you die, or I do!

940
02:04:38,967 --> 02:04:42,570
I was bred to be a warrior, Kal.

941
02:04:42,670 --> 02:04:46,740
Trained my entire life
to master my senses.

942
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:50,442
Where did you train? On a farm?!

943
02:09:01,295 --> 02:09:02,763
Are you F-ing stupid?!

944
02:09:02,796 --> 02:09:04,898
That's one of your
surveillance drones.

945
02:09:04,965 --> 02:09:09,402
That's a 12 million $
piece of hardware. - It was.

946
02:09:09,502 --> 02:09:13,472
I know you are trying to find out,
where I hang my cape, you won't.

947
02:09:13,572 --> 02:09:16,074
Then I'll ask the obvious question -

948
02:09:16,174 --> 02:09:19,443
how do we know you won't one day
act against America's interests?

949
02:09:19,543 --> 02:09:24,278
I grew up in Kansas, General.
I'm about American as its gets.

950
02:09:24,279 --> 02:09:29,584
Look, I'm here to help,
but it has to be on my own terms.

951
02:09:29,884 --> 02:09:34,421
- You have to convince Washington of that.
- Even if I was willing to try...

952
02:09:34,778 --> 02:09:40,115
- What makes you think they'd listen?
- I don't know, General.

953
02:09:40,215 --> 02:09:45,019
Guess I'll just have to trust you.

954
02:09:51,590 --> 02:09:55,561
- What are you smiling about, Captain?
- Nothing, sir.

955
02:09:58,195 --> 02:10:00,234
I just think he's kinda hot.

956
02:10:02,165 --> 02:10:07,236
- Get in the car, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

957
02:10:14,208 --> 02:10:19,411
He always believed you were meant for
greater things, and when the day came,

958
02:10:19,511 --> 02:10:23,348
your shoulders will be
able to bare the weight.

959
02:10:23,448 --> 02:10:26,450
I just wish he could have been here
to see it finally happen.

960
02:10:26,884 --> 02:10:29,686
He saw it Clark, believe me.

961
02:11:16,121 --> 02:11:19,390
What are you going to do, when
you are not saving the world?

962
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:20,825
Have you given any thought to that?

963
02:11:20,892 --> 02:11:24,528
I have, actually.

964
02:11:24,628 --> 02:11:30,199
I'm going to find a job, where I can
keep my ear to the ground.

965
02:11:33,902 --> 02:11:37,438
Where people won't look twice,
when I want go somewhere dangerous,

966
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:43,275
or start asking questions.

967
02:11:54,117 --> 02:11:57,687
Come on Lois, when are you
going to throw me a bone?

968
02:11:58,554 --> 02:12:01,390
Courtside seats to the game
tonight, what do you say?

969
02:12:01,523 --> 02:12:04,862
I'd say, you should go back
to trolling the intern pool,

970
02:12:04,953 --> 02:12:06,816
you'll probably have more luck.

971
02:12:06,821 --> 02:12:08,820
Sorry.

972
02:12:10,187 --> 02:12:13,061
- Courtside?
- Don't, don't.

973
02:12:13,401 --> 02:12:16,086
Lombardi, Lane. Want you
to meet our new stringer,

974
02:12:16,158 --> 02:12:20,321
want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent. Good luck, kid.

975
02:12:22,439 --> 02:12:25,875
- Hey. Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

976
02:12:27,076 --> 02:12:31,379
Lois Lane, welcome to The Planet.

977
02:12:34,615 --> 02:12:36,693
Glad to be here, Lois.
