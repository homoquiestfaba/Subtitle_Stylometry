00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,030
SHH.

535
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,170
FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!WHAT'S UP?

536
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,860
MY FRIEND HAS
HIS FUCKIN' PHONE OFF.

537
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:31,260
I'M GIVING HIM
TEN MINUTES.IT'LL BE FINE.

538
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,350
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
THE COPS ARE ON THEIR
WAY HERE RIGHT NOW.

539
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,350
HE'S GONNA BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

540
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:37,350
WHAT TIME DID YOUR FRIEND
SAY HE WAS COMING BACK?

541
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,130
HE'S NOT MY FRIEND.
HE'S JUST SOME GUY--

542
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,830
WHAT TIME DID HE SAY
HE WAS COMING BACK?

543
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,570
HE SAID FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

544
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,100
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

545
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,140
I DON'T KNOW.WHAT TIME?

546
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,750
I DON'T KNOW.
HE SAID FIRST THING.

547
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,490
9:00, 10:00.

548
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,410
IT'S ALREADY 11:00.

549
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:54,670
SHH. DON'T BE SCARED.

550
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,070
HE'LL COME BACK TO US.

551
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,340
FUCK.

552
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:10,470
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT THING

553
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,860
KEEP OUT OF HER STUFF.

554
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:16,000
SHE GAVE IT TO ME.BULLSHIT.

555
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,610
DUDE,
SHE GAVE IT TO ME.

556
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:19,910
GIVE IT TO ME.
GIVE IT TO ME.

557
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,180
THANK YOU.YEAH, MAN.

558
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:28,180
RENNY MUST'VE
SNATCHED THIS

559
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,360
WHILE YOU WEREN'T
WATCHING. I'M SORRY.

560
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,060
IT WAS A GIFT.

561
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,800
WHAT?

562
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,110
YOU GAVE IT TO HIM?

563
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:44,030
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

564
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,110
HUH?

565
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,030
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SMARTER THAN THAT.

566
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,680
WHAT ARE YOU WASTING
YOUR TIME FOR?

567
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,250
WHERE IS MY HUSBAND?

568
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,170
HE'S FINE,
I TOLD YOU.

569
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,340
YOU'RE GONNA
SEE HIM SOON.

570
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,960
TELL ME SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS SAINT.

571
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,660
WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE TO KNOW?

572
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:15,320
I DON'T KNOW.
ANYTHING, YOU KNOW?

573
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:19,020
WHERE'S HE FROM?

574
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,930
SWITZERLAND.

575
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,420
VERY CLOSE TO
THE PLACE WHERE
I GREW UP.

576
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,380
IS IT NICE?

577
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,810
MM-HMM.

578
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,080
HE WAS MARRIED.

579
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:42,690
12 CHILDREN.

580
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,390
HEH.

581
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:46,040
GOOD JOB.

582
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,440
BUT INSIDE, HE WAS
VERY UNHAPPY.

583
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:59,360
HE LEFT HIS FAMILY TO
LIVE IN SOLITUDE...

584
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:02,890
AND TO BE CLOSER
TO GOD.

585
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,720
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL
A DEADBEAT.

586
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,550
I THINK HIS WIFE
UNDERSTOOD.

587
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:13,070
YEAH?

588
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,120
WHAT ELSE?

589
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,910
HE DIDN'T EAT
FOR 20 YEARS.

590
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,260
THAT'S FUNNY--
20 YEARS.

591
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,220
I DON'T FALL
FOR THAT STUFF.

592
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:37,660
SHH.

593
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:46,190
IT'S OKAY.

594
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,020
I DON'T WANT TO.

595
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:56,240
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
WHAT YOU WANT.

596
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:03,430
ALL RIGHT.

597
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,260
I TOLD YOU.GREAT.

598
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,780
SHE GAVE IT TO ME--DROP IT.

599
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,480
SHE GAVE IT TO ME
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND.

600
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,570
OH, YOU UNDERSTAND?YEAH.

601
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,700
WHAT THE FUCK?

602
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,490
WHAT THE FUCK'S
YOUR PROBLEM?!

603
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,400
YOU'RE GONNA CRY
OVER A LITTLE

604
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,880
THAT'S NOT ANNABELLE
UP THERE.

605
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,400
THAT'S A STACK
OF MONEY!

606
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,710
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

607
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,190
UHH!

608
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,950
COME ON.

609
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,630
RENNY?

610
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,680
GET IN THE HOUSE,
YOU FUCKING BITCH.

611
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,860
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, RENNY?

612
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:20,130
GET BACK IN THIS CHAIR
RIGHT NOW!

613
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,740
DON'T MAKE ME
COME OVER THERE!

614
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,570
GET IN THE CHAIR, PLEASE.
GET IN THE CHAIR.

615
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,700
I'M NOT GONNA
TOUCH YOUR BABY.
GET IN THE CHAIR.

616
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,610
GET IN THE CHAIR.
HE'S NOT A BAD GUY,
YOU KNOW.

617
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,180
EVERYTHING WAS GOING
REALLY GOOD.

618
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,620
YOU MAKE HIM THINK
TOO MUCH, YOU KNOW THAT?

619
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,060
HE AND HER BROAD--
THEY HAD EVERYTHING.

620
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,840
THEY HAD A HOUSE AND
ALL THAT FUCKIN' SHIT.

621
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,630
I DON'T KNOW.
WE CAME IN HERE.

622
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:42,590
I NEVER MET HER.

623
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,890
I DON'T WANT
TO MEET HER.

624
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,680
HE'S ALWAYS SAYING
THAT HE WANTS MONEY.

625
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,500
OKAY, WE'VE JUST
GOTTA STAY ON TRACK.

626
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,590
STAY ON TRACK.AAH!

627
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,550
I DON'T MIND
EITHER WAY.

628
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,210
YOUR DAD BETTER
COME THROUGH
WITH SOME MONEY,

629
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,640
'CAUSE YOU'RE
STARTING TO RUN
OUT OF TIME.

630
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:56,690
WAIT!WHAT?!

631
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,080
WHAT?

632
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:05,090
PLEASE PROMISE
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
HURT MY BABY, RENNY.

633
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,660
YOU'RE A SPECIAL LADY
WITH YOUR LIGHT.

634
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,270
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

635
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,270
RENNY!

636
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,330
HOW IS SHE?

637
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,550
SHE'S GOOD.

638
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:36,120
SHE'S GREAT.
I TIED HER UP.

639
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,990
UNTIE HER.

640
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:41,770
UNTIE HER.

641
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,650
DON'T START WITH ME.

642
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,610
DADDY'S NOT
COMING THROUGH.

643
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,170
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

644
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,170
IT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN, MAN.

645
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,610
MURPH WOULD'VE
BEEN HERE BY NOW.

646
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,610
HE SHOWS UP NOW,
IT'S IN THE BACK SEAT
OF A COP CAR.

647
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,310
EITHER WAY, WE'RE
FUCKED OR DEAD.

648
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:58,660
OR YOUR FRIEND
RIPPED US OFF.

649
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,140
IN WHICH CASE,
WE STILL NEED HER.

650
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:08,280
UH...I SAY
CUT OUR TIES, LEO.

651
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,680
YOU KNOW, JUST--

652
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,810
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

653
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,940
I'LL GET US
BACK ON TRACK.

654
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,160
I CAN DO IT.

655
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,430
GIVE HIM ANOTHER HOUR,
ALL RIGHT?

656
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,780
IF THE OLD MAN
DOESN'T COME THROUGH,

657
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,650
SHE'S DEAD.

658
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:37,790
Irene: HEY, HOW CAN YOU WRITE ME SOMETHING SO SWEET

659
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:39,750
IN ONE MOMENT,

660
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:42,270
AND THE NEXT YOU'RE LIKE THIS?

661
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,530
HUH?

662
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,230
I'M SORRY.

663
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:48,150
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

664
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:50,710
I'M NERVOUS.WHY?

665
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,850
ABOUT SEEING
YOUR DAD.

666
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,980
THAT'S OKAY.

667
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,200
UNTIE ME.

668
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,350
I'M SCARED.

669
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,320
PLEASE.

670
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,100
WE COULD--SHH.

671
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:19,890
SHH.

672
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,680
YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

673
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,170
I MIGHT.

674
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:54,230
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE DIFFERENT.

675
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,840
UHH!

676
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:02,580
OHH!

677
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:06,590
I'M SORRY.

678
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,030
I'M SORRY.

679
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:19,380
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

680
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:28,610
A LOT OF NOSEBLEEDS
WHEN YOU PRAY.

681
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,870
YEAH.

682
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:45,630
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
ANYHOW, HUH?

683
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,890
HEY.

684
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:54,200
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
DRIVING UP TO
THE HOUSE.

685
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:18,400
SHH.

686
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,750
Man: GEORGE

687
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,250
THEY'RE LEAVING.

688
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:46,430
WE'VE GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

689
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,210
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

690
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:02,620
RENNY?

691
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,020
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

692
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:15,500
I DON'T KNOW.

693
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:31,340
RENNY!

694
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,910
HEY.

01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,040
THIS IS THE THING,
RENNY--

697
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,820
WHAT?

698
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:14,130
I MEAN, MAYBE
WE SHOULDN'T.

699
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:17,960
YOU KNOW?

700
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:21,570
I MEAN, WE ONLY GOT
ONE SHOT AT THIS.

701
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:23,570
ARE YOU
FUCKIN' INSANE?

702
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,180
NO, WE GOTTA
GET GOING NOW.

703
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,830
I NEVER KILLED NOBODY.

704
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,920
I NEVER KILLED NO ONE.

705
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:14,890
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKIN' AT ME
LIKE THAT FOR, MAN?

706
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:17,240
I'M TRYIN' TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING PERSONAL.

707
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:21,370
NO, I GET IT.

708
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,640
PLEASE...

709
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,130
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

710
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:40,800
UHH!

711
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:55,290
IT'S NATURE, RENNY.

712
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:57,070
THINGS DIE...

713
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,250
AND THINGS ARE BORN.

714
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,210
UHH!

715
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:05,600
WHAT?

716
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:07,950
WHAT?

717
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,610
HE KNOWS.

718
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,270
CAN I HOLD HIM?

719
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:22,490
I WANT TO
HOLD HIM, RENNY.

720
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:24,750
PLEASE.

721
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,750
WAIT.

722
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,930
CAN YOU FEEL HIM?

723
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:16,500
HE'S KICKING.

724
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,290
HE'S STRONG.

725
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,730
IF YOU LISTEN CAREFUL,

726
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,390
YOU CAN HEAR HIM CRY.

727
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:51,670
IT'S OKAY.

728
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:03,510
IT'S OKAY.
