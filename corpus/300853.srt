1
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,880
If you're lucky enough to have a hit TV
series, odds are you'll get fan support.

2
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,800
We have a phenomenal
legion of fans behind us.

3
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,120
They can be found worldwide
and their numbers keep growing.

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,800
Yeah. They're also very dedicated,
with numerous conventions,...

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,040
...a slew of Stargate SG-1 web sites,
many paying tribute to you, my friend.

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,520
Which I believe is the most...

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,560
- Maybe not.
- Sure.

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,360
Needless to say that without them
there might not be a Stargate SG-1.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,280
So it would be only fair to explore
the world of Stargate SG-1...

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,240
...through the eyes of our fans or,
as they call themselves, "Gaters".

11
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,400
I wanna say about one thing,...

12
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,760
...when Jonathan and I first sold
this show to Showtime with MGM,...

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,120
...we went to dinner
to celebrate and we said...

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,320
..."We won't know if we're successful
until we have maybe a big convention."

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,360
(cheering andscreaming)

16
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,520
- (woman in crowd) We love you, Amanda!
- Oh! Thank you.

17
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,360
Thank you very much.

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,520
Our fans are so generous. Some things
people have come up to me and said...

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,560
One woman came up to me
at a convention and I'll never forget it.

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,840
I was signing autographs and she came
up, looked at me and burst into tears,...

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,840
...and she said
"You make me a better person."

22
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,080
And I went "Whoa."

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,880
And she meant it from her heart.

24
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,960
And I was like "I don't know
how I've done that, but wow."

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm having a fantastic time. Christopher
Judge was amazing. He was so funny.

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,880
And all the actors are so personable.
They're amazing.

27
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,760
You have these personalities on TV. Who
knows what they're gonna be in real life?

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,000
And I think they're even more dynamic
in person than on TV. They're fantastic.

29
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,080
- How's everyone doin'?
- (cheering)

30
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,840
And just the people
and how nice they were...

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,880
...and the distances
they travelled to get there...

32
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,240
...was actually really overwhelming.
It was a great experience.

33
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,360
Over the next two days we will
have members of the Jaffa,...

34
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,160
...the Goa'uld and the Tok'ra.

35
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,160
I enjoy meeting the fans of the show
and, to tell you the honest truth,...

36
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,800
And, believe me, people watch them all.

37
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,680
- My favourite episode? "Upgrades".
- "Cold Lazarus".

38
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,600
- "A Hundred Days".
- "Need".

39
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,240
- "The Fifth Race" is very good. "1969".
- "Singularity".

40
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,840
The convention was an eye-opener.

41
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,160
You walk into this convention and you see
these people who are fanatical fans...

42
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,080
...to the point where they create
the wardrobe and show up.

43
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,000
And they just know everything about
the show and they are true, true fans.

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,560
It's pretty amazing.

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,200
That was great. It was fun.
It's a great crowd, a great group.

46
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,280
We're overwhelmed by the response.
We didn't expect it to be this big.

47
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,360
I had a wonderful time. You get a chance
to meet the fans and it's amazing.

48
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Because they're sci-fi buffs,
they're generally extremely bright people.

49
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,240
As warm and as wonderful
and as odd... (laughs)

50
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,360
...as anyone you encounter!

51
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,960
As a matter of fact, half a dozen
of the people who were in Australia...

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,240
...flew to the one in Vancouver.
I found it fascinating.

53
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,320
Stargate is huge in Germany.
Stargate ist klasse in Deutsch.

54
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,960
I remember we were talking
about the fans of the show...

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,120
...and he said "You know some people
actually think the Stargate is real?"

56
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,960
And I thought "OK, maybe there is
an interesting story there...

57
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,920
...about the world of conspiracy theories...

58
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,400
...and people who think
that there are aliens among us."

59
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,800
A top-secret government programme...

60
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,160
...involving instantaneous travel
to other solar systems...

61
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,960
...by means of a device
known as a Stargate.

62
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,360
Sounds like a goodidea for a TVshow,
if you're into that sort of thing.

63
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,480
Colonel, let's not play games. if it isn't
true, why wouldyou come all this way?

64
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,240
OK. The truth.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,720
There is a top-secret government
programme called Project Stargate.

66
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,600
- I knew it!
- It has nothing to do with space travel.

67
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,560
What does it have to do with?

68
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,960
Magnets.

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,280
- What is that supposed to mean?
- No. I've already said too much.

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,480
When our show goes on the air,
within three hours...

71
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,040
...there are 100, 200, 300 posts all posing
their opinions, all finding the holes,...

72
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,400
...all saying they got this wrong
or the science was right in this, or wrong.

73
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,360
In the episode "Tangent",...

74
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,160
...where we had done one shot
where their ship crossed the sun...

75
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,640
...and briefly occluded it
and then went away.

76
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,720
It was just a simple,
elegant visual-effect shot.

77
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,880
That garnered about 500 posts saying
"If the ship was leaving the sun's orbit,...

78
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,680
...then how could it possibly have crossed
the path at 90*?" I just smiled at that.

79
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,560
What I smiled at more was yet another fan
posting an animated diagram...

80
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,840
...showing exactly the orbital path the ship
could have taken to have passed Jupiter...

81
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,440
...and crossed in front of the sun,
allowing the camera to be in this position.

82
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,360
It just blew my mind.

83
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,040
I think people really care about
these core people. I really do.

84
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,040
At least that's what I get
from the fan mail...

85
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,120
...or from being out there
and talking to the fans.

86
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
It is a sci-fi show. They love that part of it.

87
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,680
They love the action
cos that's what the show is about.

88
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,040
But you can't take away from
the fact you have great characters...

89
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,440
...and they care about these people.

90
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,880
We are so lucky to have this fan base.
We really are. They're terrific. They're fun!

91
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,720
- Thank you very much, everyone.
- Yeah. Thanks, everybody.

92
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,960
Beyond the fantasy of science fiction is a
glimmer of reality in Stargate's universe.

93
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,800
The possibility of infinite worlds
is shared by all mankind...

94
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,920
...and the source of study
for many sciences.

95
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,240
The study of past civilisations
was the basis for the series itself,...

96
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,960
...and certainly the urge for discovery
is the heart of each story.

97
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,440
We're concerned with incorporating
reality wherever possible.

98
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,920
And, because of our strong fan support,
if we miss something, they'll call us on it.

99
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,760
So we often turn to technical
consultants for a little help.

100
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,600
- Colonel.
- General.

101
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,560
- Major.
- General.

102
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,520
- Doctor.
- General.

103
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,720
We gave them not only access to the
Cheyenne Mountain complex to shoot it,...

104
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,840
...but gave them background stories
of all the characters,...

105
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,520
...right down to what ribbons
they'd wear on their uniforms.

106
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,880
We gave them the uniform regulations
and hair advice,...

107
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
...plot lines and appropriate
military relationships -that kind of stuff.

108
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,240
We gave them all that information,
and we read every script...

109
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,920
...to make sure everything is done the way
it would really be done in the Air Force.

110
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,680
Well, with all due respect, Doctor, I...

111
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,480
It is appropriate to refer to a person
by rank, not their salutation.

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,600
You shouldcall me Captain, not Doctor.

113
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,240
Captain Carter's assignment to this unit
is notan option, it's an order.

114
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,800
I'm an Air Force officer, just like you.

115
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,240
The Air Force chief of staff, General
Michael Ryan, met with Hank Cohen,...

116
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
...the president of MGM Television.

117
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,360
They hit it off and Hank Cohen
invited him up to see the Stargate set...

118
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,000
...and decided it would be a great idea
that, as long as he's going,...

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,760
...why doesn't he write him into the scene?

120
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,000
Have you met General Ryan?

121
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,920
Hello, Colonel.

122
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,240
- The General Ryan? Chief of staff?
- That's right.

123
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,760
Shouldn't there have been
a memo or something?

124
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,680
We had him do a little cameo
and I got to talkin' to him afterwards,...

125
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,280
...or during the shooting,...

126
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,520
...tryin' to, you know, relax him
a little bit. Very tense guy.

127
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,000
And I took him aside at one point and
said "Do you have colonels like this?"

128
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,960
"Are there guys like what I'm doing with
the character in the actual Air Force?"

129
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,120
Before I could even finish the sentence
he said "Yes. And worse."

130
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,920
And I went "Great. OK."
He said "You're doin' a fine job, son."

131
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,520
I've read a lot about you, Colonel,
in General Hammond's reports.

132
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,200
Yes, sir?

133
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,360
Thus far we like your work.

134
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,800
Thank you, sir. I like yours.

135
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Your Air Force. The Air Force.
I love the Air Force.

136
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
To see someone of that stature and
to deal with them, I was so nervous...

137
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,680
...that he was totally settled down
by the time we got to him...

138
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,760
...because it took nine takes
for me to get three words out.

139
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Anything else, Colonel?

140
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,560
- No, sir.
- Then you're dismissed.

141
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,000
Thank you, sir.

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,960
Sirs. Sir. Both of you.

143
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,560
Got your hands full
with that one, eh, George?

144
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,680
This cast has the most professional
actors. They really wanna get it right.

145
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,720
They take a lot of pride
in getting everything right,...

146
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,080
...from the appropriate salute
to wearing the uniforms correctly.

147
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,920
They ask us what would we do
in this situation, how would we play it.

148
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,800
Not just what's on the script,
but how would we make that come alive.

149
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,040
Cadet, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Answer honestly.

150
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,480
Yes, ma'am.

151
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,880
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Ma'am?

152
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,440
D'you think you're better than we are,
too good for the Air Force?

153
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,600
- No, ma'am.
- Those rules and regulations...

154
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,000
- ...don't apply to you, right?
- I don't feel that way.

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,800
Oh, I think you do.

156
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,520
And I think deep down you wanna leave.

157
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,480
Let me do you a favour. The door's open.

158
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,160
- Why don't you just quit and go home?
- No, ma'am. I won't quit.

159
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,720
Good.

160
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,600
There's a lot of situations
where we run into regular problems...

161
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,560
...that we'd run into in the Air Force.

162
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,840
Such as Amanda Tapping,
the Major Carter character,...

163
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,360
...found herself in what we in the military
say is "in-between hair",...

164
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,560
...where it's too short to put up...

165
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,560
...and yet too long to meet regulations.

166
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,280
Nice hair.

167
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,560
- Uh, Air Force.
- I can't imagine that - going military.

168
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,080
I had to study as much as I could,...

169
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,120
...and when I found out I had the role
I had two weeks to prepare.

170
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,080
So I got a personal trainer to get the
physical aspect of the character down...

171
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,200
...and met with Navy SEALs.

172
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,840
- What are they doing?
- (Teal'c) They wish to take Apophis alive.

173
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,240
The science aspect
was a lot of homework.

174
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,560
I got on the Internet,
I read Stephen Hawking's book...

175
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
...and anything I could get my hands on,...

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,440
...because the only way I could play this
character is if I understood what she said.

177
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,240
And she says a lot of
scientific technobabble.

178
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,760
And if I don't underst and what I'm saying,
then I'm lying and I'm cheating.

179
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,120
And it would be very easy
to just say those words...

180
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,200
...and put an intonation to them
that sounds convincing.

181
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,560
But for me I had to understand
what she was talking about.

182
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,720
Oh, here we go.
Another scientist. General, please.

183
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,080
Theoretical astrophysicist.

184
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,760
Which means?

185
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,640
Which means she's smarter
than you are, Colonel.

186
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,920
You're constantly researching. When you
come across a doctor, you're picking...

187
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,800
I say "you", but I pick their brains
for any information I can get.

188
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,240
But being on the set we're very for tunate
in having med techs with us at all times,...

189
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,640
...so we know what to do and make it look
like we really know what we're doing.

190
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,600
- Lock him up.
- Sir, with all due respect, he is injured.

191
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,960
He won't be any good to you
unless we get him into the OR.

192
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,840
Do what you need to keep him alive,
Doctor. We've got a lot ofquestions.

193
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,160
Yes, sir. OK, let's move him.
I'm gonna set him on two IVs. Let's go.

194
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,160
In terms of Egyptology and all kinds
of mythology, not just Egyptian,...

195
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,840
...we were for tunate to have a woman
on our staff named Katharyn Powers,...

196
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,320
...who was extremely well versed
in all things mythological.

197
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,520
She also wrote several episodes...

198
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,400
...and would come running
into our offices excited...

199
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,760
...because she had just read a new myth
that lent itself very well to Stargate,...

200
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,880
...and we would build episodes around it.

201
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,720
(prayer chant)

202
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,560
They have called me a couple of times
to translate dialogue in the series...

203
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,760
...when they wanted
Ancient Egyptian to be spoken,...

204
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,600
...for two episodes: "Serpent's Song"
and "Forever in a Day".

205
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,080
I speak for Sha're, who can
no longer speak for herself.

206
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,160
(speaks Ancient Egyptian)

207
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,840
I have spoken no lies,
nor acted with deceit.

208
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,040
When I was gonna screen-test for the role
I went to the Royal Ontario Museum...

209
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,240
...and looked at the Egyptian exhibits,
as if that was gonna help me somehow.

210
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,160
This line recurs several times...
"Domavatus vestul motabilum."

211
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,160
"Conqueror of time."

212
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,880
In this context, I'd say more like
"Master of the uncertain past."

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
You're a skilled linguist, Dr Jackson.

214
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,400
The terms that are used in the series and
references to some practices and so on,...

215
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,040
...it's a blend of things
they've made up for the series...

216
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,920
...and other things which derive
from real Ancient Egyptian practices.

217
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,560
So some of the deities:
there's Osiris, the god Ra,...

218
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,400
...the goddess Isis, the wife of Osiris...

219
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,760
...and a fertility-goddess,
mother-goddess figure,...

220
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,840
...a powerful, magical force
in Ancient Egypt.

221
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,560
All these things come from real
Ancient Egyptian mythology.

222
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,760
(distorted) Make no mistake.

223
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,280
Osiris will return.

224
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,480
And the rivers of the Earth
will run red with blood.

225
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,000
As you can see, the world of Stargate
SG-1 extends way beyond the TV screen.

226
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,480
But at the heart of this show
is its cast and crew.

227
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,720
From day one we've been fortunate to
have established a strong sense of family.

228
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,680
It's part of what I feel
makes Stargate SG-1 succeed.

229
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,760
That, and a good caterer.

230
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,920
Arguably the most important
aspect of TV production.

231
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,640
Life in general.

232
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,000
Let's hear what the cast and crew have
to say about working on Stargate SG-1.

233
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,360
Those are the rewards of the job!

234
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,360
On a lot of shows I've done,
people are like...

235
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,120
..."We'll go in, shoot the show and leave."

236
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,360
Here they buy into it a lot of times,
and there's a lot of laughter on the set.

237
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,200
This crew likes coming to work here. This
cast likes coming to work here. It's fun.

238
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,920
The fact that Richard has
a great sense of humour,...

239
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,200
...Christopher Judge has
a wonderful sense of humour...

240
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,640
...and probably one of
the best laughs I've ever heard.

241
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,480
(warm, hearty laugh)

242
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,920
And so you have all these elements...

243
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,760
...and all these really goofy, wacky people
who know each other so well.

244
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,080
Yeah. Our sets are a lot of fun.

245
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,800
Richard Dean Anderson is the patriarch.

246
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,920
And Don Davis is like
the crazy grandfather.

247
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,280
Michael's the younger brother,
the wild child.

248
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,480
I'm the older brother that's been
through what Michael's been through,...

249
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,320
...who tries to give him advice,
even though the producers would say...

250
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,720
...I'm the one that led him
off the path of righteousness!

251
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,400
So we have this atypical family structure.

252
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,440
You see a lot of shows on TV, and
when you have press junkets they say...

253
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,840
..."We're just one happy family. We love
each other. Life's great and good."

254
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,000
And then once they're off set
they don't speak to each other.

255
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,560
We do. We go play golf, we go out
to dinner, we do things together.

256
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,880
It's a great show.

257
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,880
Colonel O'Neill,
what the hell are you doing?!

258
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,120
In the middle of my backswing?!

259
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,160
Richard Dean Anderson is, like Michael
and like Robert, a friend now.

260
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,200
It's amazing how close series television
brings people together.

261
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,800
Can I help you?

262
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,080
The only thing I've ever demanded
is a sense of humour.

263
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,920
It's not fun to get up at 4.30 in the morning
to go rig a light. It's hard work.

264
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,360
They look serious, don't they?

265
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,600
Year after year makes you appreciate
what a core family we have. And there is.

266
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,880
There is the mamas and the papas
and all the babies.

267
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,000
And every beginning of a new year, just
like the SG-1 team, is like a little family.

268
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,160
And it makes it
so much more fun each year,...

269
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,880
...and you appreciate it more each year,
to come back and see smiling faces...

270
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,240
...and to see, the first day, everybody
so genuinely excited to see each other,...

271
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,000
...and to be doing what we're doing
and be successful doing it.

272
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,320
I think it's been a real treat.

273
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,920
Well, I saw that planet.

274
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,760
(laughter)

275
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,600
I saw it. I was there.

276
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,480
Do I love coming to work? You bet. Do I
still pinch myself? Absolutely. It's great.

277
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,720
If you have a good story and good casting
and execute it, you'll have a good show.

278
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,160
It looks like our journey has come
full circle, so it's fair to ask...

279
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,000
...what is it about Stargate SG-1
that makes it so popular and unique?

280
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,840
Well, for one, it feeds upon
our fascination to explore the unknown...

281
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,720
...and seek out life
in other parts of the universe.

282
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,560
What I love is we're not using spaceships,
we're using the Stargate.

283
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,960
The human element is what's important.

284
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,440
It's a great way to study ourselves, our
society, under the guise of science fiction.

285
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,120
The adventures that exist
beyond the Stargate...

286
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
...are only limited by our imagination.

287
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,120
So you can be sure there are
a lot more worlds to encounter...

288
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,560
- ...and many more stories to tell.
- Only if we get back to work.

289
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,120
I'm Brad Wright.

290
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,200
I'm Richard Dean Anderson.
Thanks for joining us.

291
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,760
Comedy reigns here at Stargate SG-1...
somewhere else in the building.

292
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,440
We're not using giant spaceships
to get there. We're using the Stargate.

293
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,760
The human element is important.

294
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,680
What? What did I do?

295
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,440
Nothing. It's me.

296
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,040
Come on, the cameras are rollin'.
Do a director... Do a director thing.

297
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,800
Rick, that was a wonderful performance.

298
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,200
I haven't seen you act
like that for a long time.

299
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,800
Very natural.
