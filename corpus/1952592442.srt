1
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:42,242
A belief in a supernatural
source of evil is not necessary,

2
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,825
men alone are quite capable
of every wickedness...

3
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,367
Joseph Conrad, 1911.

4
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:57,200
Oh, my God.
How did it come to this?

5
00:03:58,117 --> 00:04:04,783
¶ Bitch slap ¶

6
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:35,075
How are you feeling,
sweetie?

7
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:38,575
I'm fine.
My noggin is still a bit throbbin'.

8
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,408
Fuckin' nothin', I told you!

9
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:47,575
I'm sorry, Trixie. It wasn't supposed
to go down like this.

10
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:30,825
Aah! Fuckin' fuckers!
Out of here!

11
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,242
Fuck off!

12
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:37,533
Stay down, dick splash!

13
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:47,533
You gotta be
fucking kiddin'.

14
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:53,200
I trusted you, boom-boom,
and you betrayed me?

15
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,658
I'm sorry.

16
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:57,492
Oh, you're feeling sad,
are you, darling?

17
00:06:57,492 --> 00:06:59,992
Well, fucking good,
you backstabbing ho!

18
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:02,367
Enough with the sublime wit,
Gage.

19
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:06,700
- You know why we're here.
- Who the fuck are you?

20
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,367
Apart from one tasty little minge
I'd like to slam like a screen door?

21
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:14,033
- Where are they, Gage?
- Well, now, darling,

22
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,367
I'm not exactly sure as
to what you're referring.

23
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:20,200
And even if I was,
I would have to ask you,

24
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,367
very politely, of course,
to yank on my dong.

25
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:28,575
- Have it your way.
- Oh, here we go.

26
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,700
You still pissed off
at me, Camero?

27
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:36,950
Obviously not.

28
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,367
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's right.

29
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:44,325
Ooh. Oh. Ooh.

30
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:48,158
That's right. I knew you couldn't resist
Mr. Sticky much longer.

31
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:50,700
You said you like it rough.
That's right.

32
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:57,867
Where's the goods?
Blow me, you psycho rug muncher.

33
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:04,742
If I told you where they're buried,
you're just gonna fucking kill me anyway.

34
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:08,700
So why don't you
and your fucking fur pie jamboree...

35
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,242
just gather 'round and slob my knob?

36
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:18,242
How about you
slob my knob, huh?

37
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:20,742
So they're buried.

38
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:25,200
Okay.

39
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:30,033
Okay.

40
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:32,492
What the fuck are you laughing at?

41
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:35,158
You.
I'm laughing at you.

42
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:37,367
Always with your nose
in other people's panties.

43
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,533
I do what I want
when I want.

44
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,658
It's cunts like you
who'll always get used.

45
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:47,575
I told you never to call me that.

46
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:50,700
Let him go.
Please, let him go.

47
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,575
Fuck you, joyride!
You're the reason he's here.

48
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:07,992
What happened?

49
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:11,325
Open the trunk!

50
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:18,367
- Let's go.
- What the fuck? Fucking...

51
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:21,700
What the fuck is wrong with you?

52
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,825
How hard can it be
to administer a simple oral serum...

53
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:26,158
- while sloshing some guy's powder keg?
- What are you doing?

54
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:28,367
She's black hair,
blonde box, Hel,

55
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,325
and I'm gonna wail on tasty
like a dog with two dicks.

56
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:34,200
- Enough. Get a hold of yourself.
- You promised me she could handle it.

57
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,533
- What happened?
- I don't know.

58
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,158
I did everything you said.
It's not my fault.

59
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:41,033
The fuck it isn't!
Everything's destroyed.

60
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:42,825
We're never gonna find it now.

61
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:45,700
- 35.34.8.81N...
- What?

62
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,492
Gage wrote it on a photograph...
Some kinda desert picture from space.

63
00:09:48,492 --> 00:09:51,033
And what good
does that do us?

64
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:54,033
They may be vector coordinates.
You're sure about those numbers?

65
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:56,533
I'm positive. I have
a photojournalistic memory.

66
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:58,325
My mom used to say she wished
I was born a midget because...

67
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:00,033
Let's go.

68
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:17,450
Tell us where to dig
and the lid comes up.

69
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,450
It's as simple as that.

70
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:25,242
What's happening to him?

71
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:26,992
My heart.

72
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:28,908
- Gage?
- No, Trixie, stop!

73
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,867
Stupid fucking cow.
Thicker than a whale omelet.

74
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:40,450
Now, you get me outta here,
or I'll snap her neck.

75
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,450
Okay. Snap away.
We don't give a shit.

76
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,867
What?

77
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:48,575
Give me the keys
and the gun right fucking now.

78
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:50,658
Okay.

79
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:54,158
Don't hurt her.

80
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:58,575
Right. Now the gun.

81
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:09,825
You fucking whore.
You blew off my tea bag.

82
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:12,658
That's two you owe me,
blow white.

83
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:14,700
- Oh, my God, you could have shot me!
- But I didn't.

84
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,325
- You're crazy!
- You're welcome.

85
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:21,200
Fun's over, Gage.
Next stop, Brown Town.

86
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,200
If I tell you, Pinky's gonna do things
to me you can't even imagine.

87
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:31,742
Pinky? What does Pinky
have to do with this?

88
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:34,575
Whose shit you think
you're dealing with?

89
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:36,492
You work for Pinky.

90
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:40,408
Oh, yeah. Not so fucking
clever now, are ya?

91
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:45,200
You stupid bitches. When Pinky finds out
about this, you're all fucking dead.

92
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:51,408
What's he talking about?
Who's Pinky?

93
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,742
If you help us,

94
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:58,408
we'll not only let you live,
but we'll take you out of here to safety.

95
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:01,867
What? No, that was never
part of the deal.

96
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:09,825
I can't.

97
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:14,908
I was hoping you'd say that.

98
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:21,075
Just tell them, Gage.
Please, just tell them.

99
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:23,992
All right, all right, all right.

100
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:26,575
Fucking shit.

101
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,533
It's over there.

102
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,950
Fifteen paces due east
of the pickup.

103
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:39,200
Trixie, grab those shovels
by the trailer.

104
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:43,533
Camero, tie him up and gag him.
Put him back in the car.

105
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:47,158
- What? We're not actually gonna...
- Who knows if he's lying?

106
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:48,867
And if trouble comes,
we need leverage.

107
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:51,700
- This is bullshit!
- Just do it.

108
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:56,575
Oh!

109
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,783
You take orders better
than a Bangkok bum boy.

110
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:09,908
Shut your fucking cake hole.

111
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:14,158
You might have a deal with her,
but you don't have one with me.

112
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:16,742
Who are they?

113
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:20,117
Puppets.
To get what I want.

114
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:23,367
How do you know
you can trust them?

115
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:26,867
Especially that one,
that fucking stripper.

116
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:29,867
She's dangerous.
You keep your eye on her.

117
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:34,242
- Stop moving!
- Hey!

118
00:13:34,242 --> 00:13:39,783
Don't turn your back
on this fucking toerag! She'll betray ya!

119
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:42,992
Just like she did all the others
at the fucking Glory Hole!

120
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,575
What's he talking about?

121
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,700
Oh, they don't know,
do they?

122
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:53,033
You were at the Glory Hole?

123
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:56,908
Damn fuckin' right she was! It was Camero
who'd have killed Liberty, and then...

124
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
So long, limp dick.

125
00:14:59,158 --> 00:15:01,200
I love Home Depot.

126
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,992
Now listen here,
you fucking slag.

127
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:07,867
I have a reputation
for being very persuasive.

128
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:11,033
And I know you're a virtuoso
with them throat muscles.

129
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,742
So you better start spilling!

130
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:16,533
Or I'm gonna send Thaddeus here
right up your chutney tube!

131
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:20,033
No!

132
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:23,158
No! No! No! No!

133
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,492
Are you out of your mind?
That wasn't part of the plan.

134
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:44,408
Maybe not part of your plan.

135
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:46,700
You told me no one's gonna get hurt.
You promised me.

136
00:15:46,742 --> 00:15:48,325
I know, Trixie. I know.

137
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:50,158
We couldn't have kept Gage alive.
He was dangerous.

138
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:54,075
No. I said right from the start,
we don't kill anybody.

139
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:56,867
Now all we have is a corpse linked
to Pinky and nothing to show for it.

140
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:58,867
My God, they're gonna
lock us up forever.

141
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:01,992
- Shut up, ax wound.
- You shut up.

142
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:03,908
- What'd you say?
- Back off, Camero.

143
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:06,867
No, why don't you let
"Gland Canyon" stick up for herself?

144
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,742
What did Gage mean by
"you'll betray us too?"

145
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:10,033
He's fuckin' with your head.

146
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,492
Why didn't you tell me
you were at the Glory Hole?

147
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:13,242
Why didn't you tell me
you knew Gage?

148
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:16,867
- Because I didn't. He was lying.
- Exactly.

149
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:19,992
This is precisely what that
conniving cock block was trying to do.

150
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:23,908
Get us to turn on each other.
He's a master manipulator, Hel.

151
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:26,492
Besides, he told us
where the stash is.

152
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:30,700
Where we hope it is, he may have
simply been trying to buy time.

153
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,908
He trusted me.

154
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,700
And now he's dead.

155
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:45,617
¶ Ain't no one as hot as me ¶

156
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:48,033
¶ That's how I roll Just agree
Ain't no apology ¶

157
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:50,742
¶ I'm so fresh, so clean
I'm so nice, so mean ¶

158
00:16:50,742 --> 00:16:53,033
¶ I'm so hot, so cool ¶

159
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:56,492
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's good.

160
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:59,533
That's it.
Show us your grabber.

161
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:01,533
You like that?

162
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:03,158
Yeah, Daddy likes.

163
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:06,242
Try this one on for size.

164
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:10,992
Fuckin' hell!

165
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:13,367
I call that move
shock and awe.

166
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,908
Oh, God.

167
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:19,367
I've never felt this way
about a gash before.

168
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:24,033
Oh! You are so sweet.

169
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:29,075
Oh, and you're decent and pure,
and I love you.

170
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:31,533
Now why don't we
tie a knot, bump uglies...

171
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:34,075
and ride the pork bus
to Tuna City?

172
00:17:34,783 --> 00:17:38,075
We'll drink to that.

173
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,658
Fuckin' hell.

174
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,700
Hey. Hey. I need you to stay strong
and focused, Trixie.

175
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,908
Remember why we're here.
We all need this.

176
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,992
You the most.

177
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:00,867
What's that?

178
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:03,408
Ring fucking ring.
Ring fucking ring.

179
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:06,533
- Ring fucking ring.
- It's coming from Gage.

180
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:11,200
Ring fucking ring. Ring fucking ring.
Ring fucking ring.

181
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,575
Ring fucking ring.
Ring fucking ring.

182
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:19,408
Ring fucking ring.
Ring fucking ring.

183
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:22,533
- Ring fucking ring. Ring fucking ring.
- Los Angeles area code.

184
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:24,367
I thought I told you
to check his pockets.

185
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:26,867
What's the big deal?
Answer it.

186
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:31,200
The big deal? With the right equipment,
anyone can ping this phone.

187
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,575
If this is Pinky
or one of Gage's thugs,

188
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:36,533
they now know he
and even we are right here.

189
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,700
- Oh, my goodness.
- See?

190
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,033
This is what happens when you don't do
as you're told. Ring fucking ring...

191
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:45,658
Fuck you, Hel. I did check him, there was
no phone on him when we left.

192
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,200
Well, obviously there was.

193
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:49,367
- You calling me a liar?
- I'm calling you reckless.

194
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:51,742
Stop it, both of you.

195
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,242
What are we gonna do now?
I know what I'm gonna do.

196
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:01,867
Fuckin' relax, Hel.
That call means nothing.

197
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:04,408
Just probably another one
of his slutty slop buckets...

198
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:06,533
looking to get worked
like a rented mule.

199
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:08,575
We can't take that chance.

200
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:11,867
We have to find what we came for
and get out of here, fast.

201
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:15,908
Fine with me. The sooner we blow
this hellhole, the better.

202
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:22,200
- But what about Gage?
- Leave him for now.

203
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,617
We'll bury him
when we're done.

204
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:30,200
This was supposed to be easy.

205
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:46,617
So, who is this Pinky person?

206
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,367
Guys?

207
00:19:50,408 --> 00:19:53,492
Pinky's a notorious
underworld figure.

208
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:57,617
Runs drugs, weapons,
industrial contraband,

209
00:19:57,617 --> 00:20:00,200
organizes hit squads,
counterfeit rings.

210
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:04,575
He's rumored to have government contracts
for wet work and supplying terror cells.

211
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:08,408
Nobody deals with Pinky directly,
and nobody even knows what he looks like.

212
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,075
Many believe Pinky is a phantom.

213
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:15,033
Others think he sold his soul to the devil.
I think he is the devil.

214
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:18,242
Come on.
You're just messing with me.

215
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:20,075
Listen up, super ball.

216
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:23,533
I've seen his victims
hanging from hooks,

217
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:25,533
cut open
like slaughtered lambs,

218
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:28,575
holding their guts in their hands,
pleading for death.

219
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:36,242
A few years ago, a Russian Oligarch
named Vladimir "The Butcher" Popmeov...

220
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:40,408
went after Pinky
with 50 of his best assassins.

221
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:46,242
Pinky blazed through that shit storm
armed only with a dusty old sword.

222
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:52,325
When it was over, the only thing left was
a 15-foot pile of dismembered bodies...

223
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:55,242
and Popmeov's head piked up...

224
00:20:55,242 --> 00:20:58,700
like the twinkly star
on a Christmas tree.

225
00:20:58,742 --> 00:21:00,867
There ain't a mac
or a blow job on the streets...

226
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:02,617
that ain't scared
shitless of him.

227
00:21:02,617 --> 00:21:05,533
Now this guy's after us?

228
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:09,450
Oh, crap.

229
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:21,242
Oh, my God,
it feels so good! Give it to me.

230
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:30,075
Get off. Gotta go.

231
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,367
- Where's the key, Black Ice?
- Fuck you, busty. I don't have it.

232
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:01,783
Fuck you, bitch!
Give me back my pick.

233
00:22:18,825 --> 00:22:21,533
Hey, darlin', wanna go
for the ride of your life?

234
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:22,908
Huh?

235
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,408
¶ Yeah ¶

236
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:39,367
¶ Yeah ¶

237
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:43,533
¶ She's a hot devil woman ¶

238
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:46,325
¶ One that I desire ¶

239
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,492
¶ Take my tremblin'
dirty hand ¶

240
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:52,658
¶ Throw it in your thighs ¶

241
00:22:52,658 --> 00:22:58,325
¶ Hey ¶

242
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:01,242
¶ You got to take
this salvation ¶

243
00:23:01,242 --> 00:23:04,200
¶ I wanna have my fun ¶

244
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:09,908
¶ Oh, yeah
Come on, man So sexy ¶

245
00:23:11,075 --> 00:23:13,658
¶ Yeah ¶

246
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,033
What?

247
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:21,492
Nothing.

248
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,950
Oh, fuck.

249
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:36,450
Gage.

250
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:44,158
Let's get him in the trunk.
Trixie, cover up any signs of blood.

251
00:23:45,242 --> 00:23:47,367
- You got him?
- Come on.

252
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:49,533
Come on!

253
00:24:00,242 --> 00:24:03,533
This is crazy. Let's just tell the truth
and end all this.

254
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:06,825
Don't say one fucking word.
No way I'm going back to the stocks.

255
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:08,700
If I have to,
I'll take him out.

256
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,533
No. Both of you just shut up
and let me do the talking.

257
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:44,367
Ladies,
everything okay here?

258
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:47,200
Boy, are we glad to see you.

259
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,242
I, uh, saw the fence down
at the highway.

260
00:24:49,242 --> 00:24:51,033
You aren't supposed
to be out here.

261
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,450
Government used to test nukes.

262
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,242
Stay too long, and you'll grow
a third eye.

263
00:25:00,242 --> 00:25:04,533
How, uh... How did you ladies
end up out here anyway?

264
00:25:05,742 --> 00:25:09,908
Well, Officer,
it's quite a story.

265
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:14,825
See, my sisters and I are members
of the Sacred Girls Virgin Choir...

266
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:16,825
out in Sand Dab, Arizona.

267
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:19,908
We were supposed to perform
a cantata today out in Mojave.

268
00:25:19,908 --> 00:25:21,742
Since we were
so far from home,

269
00:25:21,742 --> 00:25:26,450
the local parish director kindly suggested
that we stay as his guests.

270
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,867
Well, after we were all snuggled
into our one little bed for the night,

271
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:34,908
we heard loud music and laughter
coming from outside.

272
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:38,033
We peeked our heads out only to
discover the entire congregation...

273
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:41,117
dancing and... and laughing...

274
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:44,033
and smoking something
that may not have been tobacco.

275
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:46,367
They tried to fondle
our num-nums...

276
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:49,742
and even convinced Bambi Lynn
to shoot Communion wafers out of her...

277
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:54,408
Anyway, we got out
and ran to our car, but they chased us.

278
00:25:54,408 --> 00:25:56,033
Well, thank the Lord
Cheyenne can drive...

279
00:25:56,075 --> 00:25:58,492
and Bambi Lynn can gyrate
because we lost 'em!

280
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:03,658
By then, well,
it was 3:00 am. and... and dark.

281
00:26:03,658 --> 00:26:05,658
And we were scared.

282
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:08,992
And someone's not very good
with directions.

283
00:26:08,992 --> 00:26:11,950
And, well,
we ended up out here.

284
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:17,783
And now, if you can believe it,
our car's dead.

285
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,075
- I see.
- We tried to jump her,

286
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:29,908
but we just couldn't
get her off.

287
00:26:29,908 --> 00:26:34,075
That's why we're all dirty
and desperate.

288
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:38,867
- You must think the worst of us.
- No. Don't be silly.

289
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:40,908
I already
called the tow company,

290
00:26:40,908 --> 00:26:44,242
and they're
on their way, Deputy...

291
00:26:44,242 --> 00:26:46,658
Fucks.

292
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Fuchs. It's, uh...
Fuchs, ma'am.

293
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,408
Oh.
Oops.

294
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:58,492
You know,
let me take a look at her.

295
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,825
Sometimes you just gotta know
how to finger these old beauties.

296
00:27:00,825 --> 00:27:05,158
- That won't be necessary.
- Why not?

297
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:07,658
What happened to your hand?

298
00:27:11,908 --> 00:27:15,575
- Cut it on my crucifix.
- You know what?

299
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:20,242
The towing company already made us post
a 200 dollar deposit for coming out here.

300
00:27:20,242 --> 00:27:22,325
Said they'd arrive by noon.

301
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:25,825
Maybe I can save you
that money. Hmm?

302
00:27:36,242 --> 00:27:39,908
Oh. Yeah, they don't make 'em
like this anymore.

303
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,408
Nowadays, it's all computers
and sensors.

304
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:45,742
Got to work at NASA
just to change the oil.

305
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:03,742
Alright, uh, turn the key, please.

306
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:16,158
See? Nothing.

307
00:28:16,158 --> 00:28:19,533
That's odd. It, uh,
must be the starter.

308
00:28:41,825 --> 00:28:44,867
You know what?

309
00:28:44,867 --> 00:28:48,325
Sometimes these old cars
have tool kits along with the jacks.

310
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:50,492
You can't!

311
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:53,658
You can't!

312
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:57,575
- Why not?
- Be... Because...

313
00:28:57,575 --> 00:28:59,867
Because the trunk lock
is rusted out.

314
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:02,908
Hasn't opened in years.

315
00:29:07,825 --> 00:29:11,367
- You okay, miss?
- She'll be fine.

316
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:13,408
She's still upset
about last night.

317
00:29:13,408 --> 00:29:15,825
Those choirboys
tried to defile her.

318
00:29:17,742 --> 00:29:21,367
Listen, you've been so
helpful and kind.

319
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:23,908
The least I can do is
come back here and cook for you.

320
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:26,742
Say, dinner Friday?

321
00:29:26,742 --> 00:29:29,700
It's a...

322
00:29:31,242 --> 00:29:36,742
It's a tempting offer, but,
uh, I'll, uh, tell you what.

323
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:40,200
I'll... I'll swing back around later,
make sure, uh, you ladies got away safely.

324
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,950
Have a nice day, y'all.

325
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,867
I bet you
he's calling us in right now.

326
00:30:04,867 --> 00:30:09,408
We should have told him.
He looked like a nice guy.

327
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,200
He doesn't suspect a thing.

328
00:30:30,325 --> 00:30:34,325
¶ Yeah, Stank E. Digitz ¶

329
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:36,658
¶ When your bitch is on the rag
and you still wanna bang ¶

330
00:30:36,658 --> 00:30:38,825
¶ Throw a towel down
Throw a towel down ¶

331
00:30:38,825 --> 00:30:42,242
¶ When between her legs is red
you don't wanna wreck the bed ¶

332
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:44,325
¶ Throw a towel down
Throw a towel down ¶

333
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:47,075
¶ Can't stand this new trend
My girlfriend says ¶

334
00:30:47,075 --> 00:30:49,700
¶ That every month for four
to six days I can't spend ¶

335
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,283
¶ No time gettin' intimate
I guess it's innocent ¶

336
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,992
¶ Cause for sure ain't no baby
comin' through her like a vent ¶

337
00:30:54,992 --> 00:30:57,075
¶ Six days, that's a long
time to be down ¶

338
00:30:58,908 --> 00:31:01,575
Hey.

339
00:31:05,825 --> 00:31:14,408
¶ Ave Maria ¶

340
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:22,033
¶ Gratia plena ¶

341
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:25,908
¶
¶ Ave Maria ¶

342
00:31:25,908 --> 00:31:28,367
Who wants into my pearly gates?

343
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:32,408
- Me! I do!
- I'm a minister!

344
00:31:32,408 --> 00:31:34,575
My God!

345
00:31:34,575 --> 00:31:37,367
Fuck off.

346
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,075
¶ Immaculate conception ¶

347
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:50,992
¶ It's only a deception ¶

348
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,450
¶ She'd never reveal
what the devil sees ¶

349
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,492
¶ It's only her illusion ¶

350
00:31:58,492 --> 00:32:02,617
¶ I come to your conclusion ¶

351
00:32:02,617 --> 00:32:05,992
¶ The devil don't care
'cause he's already been there ¶

352
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:08,075
¶ Don't love her
Can't hate her ¶

353
00:32:08,075 --> 00:32:10,325
¶ Just pay her and lay her ¶

354
00:32:10,325 --> 00:32:15,617
¶

355
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:23,242
I'm Trixie,
your little slice of heaven.

356
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:27,825
I am in love.

357
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:30,242
Good girl.

358
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,992
¶ It's only a deception ¶

359
00:32:34,992 --> 00:32:39,158
¶ She'd never reveal
what the devil sees ¶

360
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:04,200
- You know, I've been thinking.
- Christ.

361
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,075
Is stealing from a criminal
any better than just being a criminal?

362
00:33:09,742 --> 00:33:12,408
I've got a better one
for you, princess.

363
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:16,033
What's the most outrageous place
you've ever been key-holed?

364
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,742
- Why do you wanna know?
- Just curious.

365
00:33:19,742 --> 00:33:22,408
It says
a lot about a woman.

366
00:33:22,408 --> 00:33:27,408
Hmm. Either a bumper car three-way
at the Redlands County Fair...

367
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:32,033
or on top of a horse-drawn buggy
in Amish Country with Jakey Stalfoos.

368
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:33,908
Hel?

369
00:33:35,575 --> 00:33:38,325
Let's have a little less chitchat
and a lot more digging, huh?

370
00:33:39,575 --> 00:33:42,658
I'm gonna grind those secrets
out of you one day, Hel.

371
00:33:42,658 --> 00:33:44,533
I don't have any secrets.

372
00:33:47,408 --> 00:33:49,742
Well,
what about you, Camero?

373
00:33:49,742 --> 00:33:53,117
My best bang
was a contortionist...

374
00:33:53,117 --> 00:33:56,742
out behind the freak show tent
at Circus Nudieus.

375
00:33:56,742 --> 00:34:01,242
I couldn't stand straight for days.
Never did get her name.

376
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,117
Evening, Hot Wire.

377
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,408
Haven't seen your ugly mug
since the Glory Hole.

378
00:34:48,408 --> 00:34:50,908
Camero, I was...
I was just following orders.

379
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:56,242
No hard... Smurf! Shit! Skittle!
Piss... feelings, huh?

380
00:34:56,242 --> 00:34:57,867
Where's Gage?

381
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:03,242
I don't know.

382
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:08,575
I don't have time to
be dry-fucked tonight.

383
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:43,908
Honey, I'm undefeated here.

384
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:48,408
Alright, alright. Gage put together
another Bombshell Bitchfest Blowout.

385
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:50,742
Friday, midnight.

386
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:17,783
It just keeps getting
hotter and hotter.

387
00:36:17,783 --> 00:36:20,242
I can't take this anymore.

388
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:39,200
Hey, don't waste all the...

389
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:43,700
Grab my nuts and call me Sally.

390
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,992
Uh, you might wanna cover up.

391
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:50,742
What?

392
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:53,533
Don't tell me you don't want
some of what I'm selling.

393
00:36:55,075 --> 00:36:57,742
I'm gonna get you wet.

394
00:36:57,742 --> 00:37:01,242
Okay, quit messing around, Trixie.
I mean it.

395
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:04,408
You fuckin' bitch.

396
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,492
Hey.

397
00:37:26,742 --> 00:37:29,492
Don't even think about it.

398
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:37,158
You two fucking bitches are dead.

399
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:33,367
Did the verbals
from sat-comm concur?

400
00:38:44,075 --> 00:38:46,742
Gage must have
a sick sense of humor.

401
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:49,075
And a death wish.

402
00:38:50,242 --> 00:38:52,742
- Does the girl suspect anything?
- No, Phoenix.

403
00:38:52,742 --> 00:38:55,575
Everything is proceeding as planned.
Mobilize the ops.

404
00:38:55,575 --> 00:38:57,575
We move in five days' time.

405
00:38:57,575 --> 00:39:00,325
The nano-swarm is active,
and the casualties will be immense.

406
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:05,367
Time to move.
They've traced us.

407
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,075
Ow.

408
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:22,950
- Are you okay?
- Something's poking my heinie.

409
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:26,617
What's that?

410
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,450
Help me dig.

411
00:39:40,742 --> 00:39:43,200
I think this is it.

412
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,283
Hooray for us.
We rock!

413
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:52,950
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

414
00:39:58,158 --> 00:40:00,408
Looks like he hasn't been
out here that long.

415
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:03,033
Maybe a few weeks.

416
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:07,908
No one I know.
Poor bastard. Didn't die quickly.

417
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,492
Someone was trying
to work something out of him.

418
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,742
Gage?

419
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:14,742
No.

420
00:40:14,742 --> 00:40:17,783
He was dark, not this dark.

421
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,575
There's only one person
that would do this kinda thing.

422
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,658
Are we being watched?

423
00:40:37,658 --> 00:40:39,908
This is crazy!
I've had enough!

424
00:40:39,908 --> 00:40:42,450
- I wanna go home!
- Calm down, Trix.

425
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,533
Calm down? That's all you keep
telling me, Hel, but people keep dying!

426
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:49,200
I can't end up like him!

427
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:56,825
- We're running out of time.
- Your friend's losing it.

428
00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:59,408
- She'll be fine.
- I'm not going down because of her.

429
00:40:59,408 --> 00:41:03,450
I said she'll be fine.
Check the perimeter.

430
00:41:15,408 --> 00:41:19,867
I'm sorry, Hel.
I thought I could do this.

431
00:41:20,742 --> 00:41:23,242
I thought
I could be strong.

432
00:41:23,242 --> 00:41:26,783
No, Trix.
I let you down.

433
00:41:28,075 --> 00:41:30,492
I never should have
asked you to do this.

434
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:35,408
You didn't force me.

435
00:41:35,408 --> 00:41:39,992
I wanted to be here...
with you.

436
00:41:49,408 --> 00:41:54,658
You're the first person in my whole life
who's ever really believed in me.

437
00:42:04,575 --> 00:42:06,992
We shouldn't.

438
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:10,200
Not here.

439
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:13,783
Please.

440
00:42:13,783 --> 00:42:16,158
I need you.

441
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:20,242
I've never felt
this way before.

442
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:22,700
About anyone.

443
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,533
Then why don't you
kiss me?

444
00:42:29,908 --> 00:42:32,283
Now.

445
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:46,117
What the fuck?

446
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:50,992
Camero.
I can explain.

447
00:44:50,992 --> 00:44:56,283
I'm out there sweating my ass off,
and you're in here bashing gash?

448
00:44:56,992 --> 00:44:59,325
And Gage was right.
I can't trust you.

449
00:44:59,325 --> 00:45:01,783
- Yes, you can.
- Bullshit!

450
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:03,492
What else
aren't you telling me?

451
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,533
You planning on cutting me out
of the score as well?

452
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:06,450
Don't be ridiculous.

453
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,283
Who's being fucking
ridiculous, Hel?

454
00:45:08,283 --> 00:45:11,575
It's my fault, Camero.
I asked Hel not to tell you.

455
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:15,033
I knew you'd fly off the handle
and become even more uncontrollable.

456
00:45:15,742 --> 00:45:18,117
So I need to be controlled.

457
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:21,533
- Is that what you think? Is it?
- No.

458
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:24,950
Because I'm not the one here
plumbing the depths of cooterlicious,

459
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,783
pretending to be
something I'm not.

460
00:45:27,783 --> 00:45:32,200
I knew you were trouble.
I never should have let Hel bring you in.

461
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,950
We wouldn't have found this place
without her, remember?

462
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,450
True.
So now we can waste her.

463
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,283
Kill her and you'll
have to kill me too.

464
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:45,367
And then you won't have anyone
to fence the goods or work the contacts.

465
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,367
Is that what you want?

466
00:45:48,283 --> 00:45:50,283
I'm sorry, Camero.

467
00:45:50,283 --> 00:45:54,117
I should have told you about us
right from the start,

468
00:45:54,117 --> 00:45:57,617
but I never thought about
betraying you on this deal.

469
00:45:57,617 --> 00:46:00,450
We're all in this
to the end.

470
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:04,367
Either we all win
or we all lose,

471
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:07,367
and losing now
has way too high a price.

472
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,117
Lie again
and you're both dead.

473
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

474
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,617
That was my fault.
I couldn't control myself.

475
00:46:54,617 --> 00:46:57,700
Don't ever apologize
for being you.

476
00:46:58,617 --> 00:47:01,117
You know,
she scares me, Hel.

477
00:47:01,117 --> 00:47:03,367
Are you sure she's
not gonna try something?

478
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:06,783
With Camero, there's no sure things.
Help me up, will you?

479
00:47:18,283 --> 00:47:20,867
Whoa.

480
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,783
Looks like Gage
was ready for war.

481
00:47:23,783 --> 00:47:26,783
Camero, get in here!
We found something!

482
00:47:30,533 --> 00:47:32,617
K-14 Corsair rail gun...

483
00:47:32,617 --> 00:47:34,533
Carbon fiber mounts,

484
00:47:34,533 --> 00:47:39,450
Hellfire dampening system
and Zion laser scope.

485
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:45,283
This is some serious
and classified hardware.

486
00:47:46,117 --> 00:47:48,450
How do you know all that?

487
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:53,950
My father was a part of the C.I.A.'s
Ghost Recon Group in the '80s.

488
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,283
Oh.

489
00:47:56,283 --> 00:47:58,450
Camero, you hear me?

490
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:11,950
W... Where did she go?

491
00:48:12,783 --> 00:48:15,200
Camero?

492
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,533
Where are you?

493
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,200
Trixie, get inside,
quick.

494
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,533
- What up, bitches?
- Hi, hi!

495
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:50,950
You ain't kidding, Kinki. It's the Poontang
Valley Express around here.

496
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:52,033
Hmm.

497
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:54,033
Who the hell are you?

498
00:48:54,033 --> 00:48:56,367
Think of us as, uh,

499
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:03,617
debt collectors,
Pussybone Parfait!

500
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:45,617
Oh.

501
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:02,033
Uh-oh, naughty girl.

502
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:04,617
Kinki spanking.

503
00:50:06,867 --> 00:50:09,700
Take it easy. Take it easy.
You're okay.

504
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:19,783
Looks like we got you
by the balls this time, Camero.

505
00:50:21,117 --> 00:50:22,783
You know these two?

506
00:50:22,783 --> 00:50:27,283
Oh, when she came looking for Gage,
I figured something big was up.

507
00:50:27,283 --> 00:50:29,783
Love me long time, jeeter!

508
00:50:29,783 --> 00:50:32,117
We've been tracking you.

509
00:50:32,117 --> 00:50:34,450
So...

510
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,200
the legendary
Gage treasure is true.

511
00:50:39,117 --> 00:50:42,117
- Where is it at?
- We don't know.

512
00:50:42,117 --> 00:50:44,367
Look, don't dry fuck me.
I won't think twice about having Kinki...

513
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:46,450
shit me a loud
purple twinkie...

514
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:48,200
your pretty little faces.

515
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,117
Gage lied to us.
It's not buried where he said.

516
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,617
Oh.

517
00:50:54,617 --> 00:50:56,617
Well, then you better
keep digging.

518
00:50:56,617 --> 00:51:00,867
Fuck that. I ain't shoveling
anything for you but your grave.

519
00:51:02,283 --> 00:51:06,617
Enough! We'll dig.
Just leave her alone.

520
00:51:10,117 --> 00:51:14,283
I'm gonna enjoy beating
7 shades of shit out of both of you!

521
00:51:22,783 --> 00:51:26,867
Still... Bunghole Barney Bungalow...
same old Camero.

522
00:51:28,117 --> 00:51:31,450
Now start fucking digging.

523
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,283
I want to play with the...

524
00:51:37,867 --> 00:51:40,117
Not you, cherry pie.

525
00:51:40,117 --> 00:51:42,867
You stay here.

526
00:51:46,283 --> 00:51:48,617
Do as he says.

527
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:00,367
You see, Kinki likes you.

528
00:52:01,283 --> 00:52:04,950
Kinki wants to play.

529
00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:14,117
What does she
wanna play?

530
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:37,533
Yeah. Ooh.

531
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:43,033
I need help gettin' off.

532
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,867
I'm going to miss you, Camero.

533
00:52:46,867 --> 00:52:49,450
You certainly have
livened up my incarceration.

534
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,950
Inmate 1138.
You're ready for processing.

535
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,950
All clear.

536
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:57,950
- Evac Cell 2187.
- But...

537
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:01,783
I told you.
I can still get you out.

538
00:53:01,783 --> 00:53:05,200
But you have to give me
something to work with.

539
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,783
Stick your finger
in her ass, Camero.

540
00:53:09,783 --> 00:53:12,033
All right, let's go.

541
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:21,617
Can I trust you?

542
00:53:21,617 --> 00:53:23,617
Of course.

543
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:27,533
Get me outta here, and I'll split
200 million in diamonds with you.

544
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:41,117
Giddyup!
Giddyup!

545
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:44,200
Come on! Go faster!
You're my horse.

546
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,033
Come on. Let's go.
Faster.

547
00:53:46,033 --> 00:53:49,283
- Whoo!
- Yee-ha!

548
00:53:49,367 --> 00:53:51,367
Ride her, Kinki! Whoo!

549
00:53:51,367 --> 00:53:53,617
Giddyup. Show your mama.
Come on. Let's go. Faster.

550
00:53:53,617 --> 00:53:55,867
- Hey.
- Huh?

551
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:05,533
It's a private show!
Back to work!

552
00:54:08,117 --> 00:54:10,450
Let's go! Come on!
Yah!

553
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:13,283
If I make a diversionary run
for the guns,

554
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:17,283
you think you can get
close enough to Trixie?

555
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,200
Huh?

556
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,033
Oh, what, are you not
talking to me now?

557
00:54:25,033 --> 00:54:29,117
- Come on, Camero. I need you.
- To save Miss Magic Mouth?

558
00:54:29,117 --> 00:54:31,117
No way.

559
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,450
Are you on something?

560
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:35,700
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

561
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,783
I should've
never trusted you,

562
00:54:37,783 --> 00:54:40,200
certainly never
fallen in love.

563
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:45,117
Get 'em, girl! Get 'em, girl!

564
00:54:45,117 --> 00:54:48,367
Whoo! Whoo!

565
00:54:57,117 --> 00:54:59,283
That's it.

566
00:54:59,283 --> 00:55:02,450
Get up.

567
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:06,283
- Get up.
- No.

568
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:10,200
No! No! No!
Stop! No! No! No!

569
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,367
Forget about her.

570
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:16,617
We can pull this off.
It's about you and me now.

571
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:19,450
No! No! Stop it!
Help! Help me!

572
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:22,617
Stop! No! No!

573
00:55:22,617 --> 00:55:25,783
Hey, we've
found something!

574
00:55:26,283 --> 00:55:29,283
Gorgonzola orgy!

575
00:55:29,283 --> 00:55:33,867
Come on, flat ass.

576
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:40,117
Clear it.

577
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,867
You clear it.

578
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:53,450
Open it.
I said open it.

579
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,450
On your knees,
balloon boobs.

580
00:55:55,533 --> 00:55:57,450
It's the only place
you've ever been good at anyway.

581
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:07,117
Open it!

582
00:56:15,033 --> 00:56:16,867
Maybe there's
some kind of code.

583
00:56:16,867 --> 00:56:21,700
Well, who knows the... P... P... Plumps
when you cook it... code?

584
00:56:22,367 --> 00:56:24,450
Who knows it?

585
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,950
No one?

586
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,783
Kinki's right. No one spills,
no reason to keep you alive.

587
00:56:35,783 --> 00:56:39,200
Wait! Let me try.

588
00:56:41,367 --> 00:56:43,200
- Let me try.
- Hurry up!

589
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,033
- Okay.
- Hurry it up!

590
00:56:45,033 --> 00:56:46,533
- Okay.
- Hurry up!

591
00:57:00,783 --> 00:57:04,450
Whoo-ee!

592
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,417
Thank you, Happy Sacks.
We'll take it from here.

593
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:09,292
- Kinki, kill 'em.
- Okay.

594
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,125
Hold it!

595
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:14,417
I knew something
was going on here.

596
00:57:14,417 --> 00:57:16,833
Drop it!

597
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:19,708
Uh, everybody
on the ground. Go!

598
00:57:19,708 --> 00:57:23,375
Drop it, I said.
Come on. Drop it.

599
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:25,958
All right, this is the last time
I'm gonna tell you.

600
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:29,125
Drop the weapon
and get on the ground!

601
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,833
Okay, let's go.

602
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:50,250
Let's go. Come on.

603
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:53,875
- Oh, no.
- Get away!

604
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:56,875
Somebody has
a problem here.

605
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:59,875
- Get away.
- Here I come.

606
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:14,958
Come on.

607
00:58:50,917 --> 00:58:54,875
Oh, shit!

608
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:24,042
No!

609
00:59:24,042 --> 00:59:26,917
Fortune cookie say,
"Future not so bright".

610
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:34,042
- Who...
- Stop!

611
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:35,500
are you?

612
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,000
Camero, stop!

613
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,708
- Stop it, Camero! No!
- That's it, Pop Tart.

614
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:46,333
I'm gonna dog-pound you
straight to China.

615
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:54,375
That's enough,
God-fucking-damn it!

616
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:58,708
I've had enough of this bullshit!
It's gonna end right fucking now!

617
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:02,167
- Starting to lose our cool, are we?
- We tie him up in the trailer.

618
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:04,375
Let's gank this fucker right now.
No matter who he is,

619
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:06,667
he won't nipple-lick us
if he's sucking daisy roots.

620
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:09,250
No more killing today,
period.

621
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:13,542
If you were up for 7 to 10, Hel,
how did you fly in under 3 weeks?

622
01:00:13,542 --> 01:00:17,083
And how the fuck did you spring me
with 12 years left on my sentence?

623
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:23,167
Well, this is America. She.. She's sexy and
loaded and has high-powered connections.

624
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:26,750
- Bullshit.
- I just saved your ass, again.

625
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,125
The fuck you did!
I had it under control.

626
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,917
You're becoming
a liability, Camero,

627
01:00:30,917 --> 01:00:33,500
not to mention a martyr
to selective amnesia.

628
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,458
You're so hopped up on whatever shit
you're dropping, you're irrational.

629
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:41,583
Fuck you! I'm finally starting to see you
for who you really are.

630
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,917
What is she
talking about?

631
01:00:44,917 --> 01:00:48,583
The prison,
the weapons, the cash.

632
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:52,042
Your mastery
of Honduran snuff sex.

633
01:00:52,042 --> 01:00:56,792
You wanna tell Good & Plenty
what you punched in, or should I, Hel, huh?

634
01:00:56,792 --> 01:01:01,375
7-5-6-5-0.
What does that spell?

635
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:06,875
Oh, my God!
Why did you do that?

636
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:09,625
I had no choice, Trixie.

637
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:12,375
She's clearly delusional
and off the rails.

638
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:14,417
Grab his cuffs
and secure him inside.

639
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:18,083
What are you gonna do?

640
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,417
What needs to be done.

641
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:42,625
I'm sorry.

642
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:46,167
Thank you, Trixie.

643
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:53,958
- How do you know my name?
- Uh...

644
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:58,000
Who are you?

645
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I'm a big fan.

646
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:04,542
A what?

647
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:09,458
Uh... An aficionado
of your ass... sets.

648
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:12,417
Uh, I've seen you at Papa Piccolo's
Naughty Knickers Round-up.

649
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:15,792
You're... astonishing and...

650
01:02:15,792 --> 01:02:18,250
uh, gorgeous.

651
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:24,417
When I... I came by earlier,
I... I knew it was you.

652
01:02:24,417 --> 01:02:27,333
And I... I could tell something was wrong,
and I was worried about you.

653
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:33,625
Oh, God...

654
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:38,125
I'm sorry. You must think
I'm some kind of... crazy stalker.

655
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:41,542
You were worried
about me?

656
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:45,667
What's your name?

657
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:47,917
Roy.

658
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:54,125
Deputy Roy Eugene Fuchs, ma'am.

659
01:02:54,792 --> 01:02:57,542
That's a nice name.

660
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,917
What are you mixed up in?

661
01:03:04,917 --> 01:03:07,208
Who are those women?

662
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:09,750
I don't even think
I know anymore.

663
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:13,042
Let me help you, Trixie.

664
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:23,208
Come on.

665
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,667
Hey, I'll be back.

666
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:38,542
It's not too late to make
the right decision, Trixie.

667
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:43,583
Either way,
I'm here for you.

668
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:21,167
Where's Camero?

669
01:04:25,917 --> 01:04:28,000
You chained her up?

670
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,917
She's all right. Come on.

671
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:33,667
I'm scared, Hel.
What's going on?

672
01:04:33,667 --> 01:04:36,250
You're just gonna have
to trust me on this, Trixie.

673
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,667
Now, let's go.

674
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:43,292
I'm sorry.

675
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:46,833
You better pray to whatever God
you worship I don't get outta this thing.

676
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:04,667
What is it
that troubles you, Sister?

677
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,708
You have to help me,
Mother Superior.

678
01:05:06,708 --> 01:05:10,917
My impure thoughts have gone
beyond inanimate objects...

679
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:15,167
and devolved into lusting
after strapping Latvian gymnasts.

680
01:05:15,167 --> 01:05:16,333
No!

681
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:24,875
Oh, Sister Sara.

682
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:28,917
- Ah.
- Oh!

683
01:05:28,917 --> 01:05:33,208
- Oh. Uh...
- God-fucking-damn it.

684
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:35,875
Sister Prudence Bangtail.

685
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:38,083
Well, this is the last straw.

686
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:40,250
Save it, crusty.
I'm vapor.

687
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:43,375
This place bites anyway.

688
01:05:51,792 --> 01:05:54,625
Ooh!

689
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:01,458
May God have mercy
on your soul.

690
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:14,333
Freeze, Sister!

691
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:19,125
Put your hands in the air.
Do it now.

692
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:28,417
Well, well, well.

693
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:31,333
Hiding out
in a convent?

694
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:35,167
Impersonating a nun?
Juggling pussy in a pornographic circus?

695
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:39,792
Oh, that is tasteless,
even for you, Camero.

696
01:06:46,042 --> 01:06:48,375
Ah.

697
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:53,958
Right-o, lads,

698
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:57,708
don't be afraid
to use excessive force on this one.

699
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:09,250
I can't see a thing.

700
01:07:10,042 --> 01:07:12,375
Move back.

701
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,500
What is all this?

702
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,458
- It's everything Gage stole from Pinky.
- Huh?

703
01:07:50,458 --> 01:07:55,292
That crafty fucker's
been funneling Pinky's goods for years.

704
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:58,000
That's why
he stashed out here...

705
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,500
so he could secretly distribute the goods
each time a buyer was secured.

706
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,417
How do you know
all this?

707
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:09,792
If you lay with criminals...
Be careful.

708
01:08:09,792 --> 01:08:14,000
There will be
dangerous shit down here.

709
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:06,500
Hey, Hel, look at this.

710
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:10,542
It's beautiful.
Can I keep it?

711
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:13,708
Sure. Keep it.

712
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:33,125
I found them.

713
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:42,708
Oh, my!

714
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:44,875
Flawless,

715
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:47,000
uncoded...

716
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,417
and all ours.

717
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,917
Well, what now?

718
01:09:57,958 --> 01:09:59,958
Time to disappear.

719
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,792
Shit.

720
01:10:14,792 --> 01:10:18,125
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Just get to the car and start it up.

721
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:20,208
- But we can't leave Roy.
- Go!

722
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:23,500
But... But...
Just... Just go to the car!

723
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:36,667
Time to get medieval.

724
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:40,333
Camero, ease up.

725
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:44,250
We have the diamonds.
Okay? The plan worked.

726
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:46,250
All we have to do is drive away,
and we've won.

727
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:47,333
Bullshit.

728
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:49,583
I trusted you before.
Look where that got me.

729
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:52,958
Goddamn it, Camero!
I'm not gonna let you fuck this up now!

730
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:54,958
Drop that chain and get
your head on straight.

731
01:10:54,958 --> 01:10:58,208
Time to test your loyalty
and see what you're really made of.

732
01:10:58,208 --> 01:11:03,708
A wet-job, Polly punanni,
and all is forgiven, whoever you are.

733
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:07,667
Come on.
You and me started this.

734
01:11:07,667 --> 01:11:10,167
- You and me should finish it.
- No.

735
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:12,583
- We're in this together.
- Fine.

736
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:16,208
Then I'm gonna sleigh-ride
your sorry ass once and for all.

737
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:24,583
If you want me,

738
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:27,750
come and get me.

739
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,375
Come on, guys.
Don't. Please don't.

740
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:12,708
Come on, guys. Stop!

741
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:38,583
I said stop!

742
01:13:28,792 --> 01:13:31,833
Stop!
Camero, stop it!

743
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:33,958
You're next, Pantyraid.

744
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:53,500
Stay down, Camero.
I don't wanna have to kill you.

745
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:10,458
How do you like it, bitch?

746
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:13,375
Did you really think
you could beat me, huh?

747
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,500
Get this fucking going!

748
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:52,042
Trixie. Trixie!

749
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:19,250
Trixie!

750
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:27,375
Fire in your hole.

751
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:58,083
So long, bitches.

752
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:07,208
Ram this in your clambake,
bitch cake.

753
01:16:25,042 --> 01:16:28,417
Roy! Roy!

754
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:23,208
Go ahead and kill me.

755
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:25,542
I don't care anymore.

756
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:32,792
It's all a lie, isn't it?

757
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:41,625
Yes.

758
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:44,875
Why?

759
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:47,375
Who are you?

760
01:17:48,875 --> 01:17:51,542
- Are you...
- No.

761
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:55,375
I'm not Pinky.

762
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:59,250
I'm...

763
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,042
Give me the specs, Dieter.

764
01:18:27,417 --> 01:18:30,958
The specs! Now!

765
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:33,042
You've got the wrong überman.

766
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:36,125
I know nothing of this
murderous plague you speak of.

767
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:38,292
Wrong answer, Dieter.

768
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:52,625
Congratulations, Foxy 69.

769
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:55,667
Mission accomplished, Phoenix.
I have the antitoxin data.

770
01:18:55,667 --> 01:18:59,000
I have another assignment
that demands your immediate attention.

771
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,958
As you know, the Glory Hole was a...
regrettable miscalculation.

772
01:19:02,958 --> 01:19:06,542
But tac-comm has learned of another
opportunity to retrieve the nano-swarm.

773
01:19:09,292 --> 01:19:11,208
I'm sending you to
Honey Junction Women's Prison...

774
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:14,625
to infiltrate and make contact with
a former colleague of Mortimer Gage.

775
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,708
She goes by an alias, Camero.

776
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:18,833
I'm on it.

777
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:22,750
Good. Now, bury all evidence
and get yourself home.

778
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:25,500
Phoenix out.

779
01:19:45,417 --> 01:19:47,833
Oh, my God.

780
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:50,958
You're a wicked-cool
covert operative...

781
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:54,292
masquerading
as a sex-toy tycoon?

782
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:57,042
Mm-hmm.

783
01:19:58,542 --> 01:20:01,625
My mission was
to reclaim that...

784
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:03,667
a weaponized vial
of synthetic nano-swarm...

785
01:20:03,667 --> 01:20:06,500
that Gage hijacked
from a C.I.A. convoy.

786
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:09,708
It's filled with trillions
of self-replicating robo-viruses...

787
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:13,250
that latch on to any living organism
and suck the carbon out...

788
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:17,875
till you, me, even the cockroaches
are nothing more than gray goo.

789
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:21,375
It could wipe out an entire continent
if properly deployed.

790
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:24,000
I had to extricate it
before Gage tried, again,

791
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,500
to sell it to another combatant country
or crazed libertarian.

792
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:32,458
So the plan,
the diamonds, us...

793
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:35,208
was all just a crock?

794
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:39,333
No. Not us, Trix.

795
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:43,250
What I am doesn't change
how I feel about you.

796
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,667
Everything
between us is real.

797
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,667
You've changed me.

798
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:54,583
Made me see a life
I've been missing.

799
01:20:55,417 --> 01:21:00,042
Craving really.

800
01:21:00,042 --> 01:21:03,667
I'm through being Foxy 69.

801
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:06,667
But you can't just walk away
from Flesh Force Foxy...

802
01:21:06,667 --> 01:21:08,750
with a wink
and a hi-dee-ho.

803
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:11,417
I needed leverage
and a huge bankroll.

804
01:21:11,417 --> 01:21:14,417
The vial and the diamonds
give us both.

805
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:21,792
Now you, Lily and me can slip off
to a small Micronesian island together...

806
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,292
forever.

807
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,833
And playfully wrestle
in the surf?

808
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:32,958
Among other things.

809
01:21:34,708 --> 01:21:36,167
- I love you.
- Mmm.

810
01:21:49,417 --> 01:21:52,417
The bitch is back, baby.

811
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:59,167
It hurts, doesn't it?
Having someone you love taken away.

812
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:00,292
It wasn't her fault,
Camero.

813
01:22:00,292 --> 01:22:03,333
Fuck you!
It was all her fault.

814
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:05,417
I have nothing.

815
01:22:06,667 --> 01:22:09,542
Nothing!

816
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:11,417
And it's all because of her
and you.

817
01:22:16,667 --> 01:22:21,167
I'm gonna booty-bang
bitch slap your fucking ass...

818
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:24,500
until you're
just this side of salvage.

819
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:28,625
Then I'm gonna ram-ride
girly's show tits asunder...

820
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:32,458
before I plow both of you
bitches under!

821
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:15,667
Open wide, psycho slut!

822
01:24:20,583 --> 01:24:23,625
Lube my boobs,
skank twat!

823
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,750
You had enough?

824
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:08,667
No.
You?

825
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:13,583
Blow me.

826
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:24,250
Fuck layin' tube!

827
01:25:25,583 --> 01:25:30,500
- Fuck wad!
- Lick my love pup!

828
01:25:52,042 --> 01:25:54,750
Blow my biscuit!

829
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:22,083
No.

830
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:28,333
Camero, stop!

831
01:26:41,292 --> 01:26:44,042
No! Please, no! Stop!

832
01:26:44,042 --> 01:26:46,250
No!

833
01:26:57,750 --> 01:27:01,083
No. No. Hel, no!

834
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:15,792
Just us now, Buttercups.

835
01:27:15,792 --> 01:27:19,750
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me!

836
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:25,083
Mrs. Honeypot,
can Trixie come out to die?

837
01:27:27,125 --> 01:27:29,667
Stop! No! No! No!

838
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:32,667
Come on. Fight me!

839
01:27:34,542 --> 01:27:37,875
I'm too weak and vulnerable.

840
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:41,583
Fine. If you won't fight,
then you gotta fuck.

841
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:44,500
- Prepare to come about, bitch.
- Camero, stop!

842
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,667
Time to get me some
of what Hel's been gettin'.

843
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:47,958
Stop! Stop, please!

844
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:50,125
Don't! Please!

845
01:27:51,875 --> 01:27:54,875
Hello, kitty.

846
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:18,583
Yeah!

847
01:28:27,292 --> 01:28:31,708
I'm gonna baste your giblets,
butter britches.

848
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:41,292
You're her?

849
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:45,292
You're my best lay ever?

850
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:48,792
Surprise.

851
01:28:48,792 --> 01:28:52,417
You lying fucking whore!

852
01:28:58,167 --> 01:29:03,042
The women's movement
will hoist my skirt for all eternity.

853
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:54,542
Oh, my God.

854
01:29:55,708 --> 01:29:58,042
Oh, my God.

855
01:29:58,042 --> 01:30:00,542
How did it come to this?

856
01:30:25,125 --> 01:30:27,625
How did it come to this?

857
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:31,417
I'll tell you.
Human nature.

858
01:30:32,542 --> 01:30:37,125
Early Christianity tells us
of humanity's seven deadly sins.

859
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:41,375
I'm unclear whether lust,
gluttony, greed, sloth,

860
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:45,625
wrath, envy and pride
are human sins...

861
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:50,250
or defining
human characteristics.

862
01:30:53,417 --> 01:30:56,583
Foxy 69, target on sight.

863
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:58,083
Roger that.

864
01:30:58,083 --> 01:31:00,625
Foxy down in 20, 19,

865
01:31:00,625 --> 01:31:03,917
18, 17...

866
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:51,875
Foxy 69 in position.

867
01:31:54,083 --> 01:31:56,458
Hold it. We'll take those.

868
01:32:05,042 --> 01:32:08,083
Ooh. That's a bit frightening,
isn't it?

869
01:32:11,417 --> 01:32:13,583
Foxy, take 'em out.

870
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:18,708
Help me!

871
01:32:24,583 --> 01:32:27,458
Oh, my God.

872
01:33:21,583 --> 01:33:23,917
Camero!

873
01:33:30,542 --> 01:33:32,625
What the fuck is that?

874
01:34:09,042 --> 01:34:12,125
Bite me!

875
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:32,250
Oh, yeah.

876
01:36:28,417 --> 01:36:30,917
Trixie, why?

877
01:36:31,417 --> 01:36:33,333
What can I say?

878
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:38,125
We're all just bitches
in the end.

879
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:05,625
Who are you?

880
01:37:05,625 --> 01:37:08,625
I think you know.

881
01:37:09,792 --> 01:37:11,833
But why me?

882
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:13,958
Why Camero?

883
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:16,417
You were lost souls,

884
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:18,958
and I thought
it would be fun.

885
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:24,000
- And Phoenix?
- Phoenix works for me.

886
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,083
Always has... or did.

887
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:29,083
He got careless.

888
01:37:29,083 --> 01:37:32,125
I guess we know
where that ended up.

889
01:37:34,583 --> 01:37:37,083
So this whole thing...

890
01:37:37,083 --> 01:37:40,042
my mission, us meeting,

891
01:37:40,042 --> 01:37:42,375
Camero...

892
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:48,667
It was all for this.

893
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:54,250
Made in the 16th century
by Master Craftsman Umatada Mjouji.

894
01:37:54,250 --> 01:37:58,917
This naginata has seen battles won
and empires fall...

895
01:37:58,917 --> 01:38:00,917
for over 600 years.

896
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:04,125
It's the one thing
I love on this godforsaken Earth.

897
01:38:04,125 --> 01:38:07,917
And Gage was stupid enough
to think I didn't care.

898
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,833
How could you do this?

899
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:15,417
Play the victim?
I loved you.

900
01:38:15,417 --> 01:38:18,083
A girl's gotta get her jollies
somehow.

901
01:38:18,083 --> 01:38:20,417
Oh.

902
01:38:20,458 --> 01:38:23,833
And I really get off
watching girls fight.

903
01:38:25,208 --> 01:38:28,833
- You guys were awesome.
- What are you waiting for?

904
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:32,583
Go on.
Finish your sick little game.

905
01:38:35,167 --> 01:38:38,208
We read we ought
to forgive our enemies,

906
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:41,750
but we do not read...
That we should forgive our friends.

907
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:46,458
Cosimo de' Medici, 1454.

908
01:38:53,583 --> 01:38:55,708
Go to hell, Trixie!

909
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:00,750
Last one in's a rotten egg.

910
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:04,000
Last one in's a rotten egg.

911
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:27,083
"All warfare is based on deception.

912
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:30,500
"Hence, when able to attack,
we must seem unable.

913
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:34,083
"When using our forces,
we must seem inactive.

914
01:39:34,083 --> 01:39:37,917
"When we are near, we must make
the enemy believe we are far away.

915
01:39:37,958 --> 01:39:41,458
"When far away, we must
make him believe we are near.

916
01:39:41,458 --> 01:39:44,625
"Hold out baits
to entice the enemy.

917
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:48,583
Feign disorder and crush him".
