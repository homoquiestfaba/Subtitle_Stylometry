1
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,782
(sirens wailing)

2
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,622
(car horn honking)

3
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,361
Hey, cop?

4
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,364
Cop?

5
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,601
Come on, man.
I'm talking to you.

6
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,470
Are you married?

7
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,207
You got kids?

8
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:25,579
My LCL boys
are gonna find your family.

9
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:32,286
We're gonna fuck your wife...

10
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,157
...and then we're gonna kill
your kids in front of her.

11
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:42,162
And then we might just
fuck her again.

12
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,966
But you know what?
Don't worry.

13
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,167
You know,
we're not gonna hurt her

14
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,370
because we want her
to go back to you...

15
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,674
...so every time you touch her,

16
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,876
she thinks of us.

17
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,779
What do you think of that?

18
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,050
Hey,
you're a piece of shit, man.

19
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,252
You know that?

20
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:06,820
Wherever you're going,
it's a dark place, man.

21
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,890
You're crossing into a dark
place and you can't come back.

22
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:16,630
Fuck you, man.
Fuck you and your fucking life.

23
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,469
You fucking piece of shit.

24
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,904
Somebody like you, man,
fucking...

25
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,275
You been pretending
your whole fucking life, man.

26
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:31,579
And now you're gonna live
for real, like me.

27
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:32,646
(laughs)

28
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,251
And the best part is
I get to be here to see it.

29
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,654
What do you think of that?

30
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,906
(sirens wailing)

31
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:46,354
(siren wailing)

32
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:50,624
(heels tapping)

33
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,826
(horn honking)

34
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,003
(music continues)

35
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,059
(grunting)

36
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,160
Rourke: Let go!

37
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,962
I'm a police officer.
Police officer!

38
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:08,235
(crashing)
Cavanaugh: Police, don't move!

39
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,803
Get up. I'm the fucking law.
Get up.

40
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,171
Detective: Put your
hands back!

41
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,239
Cavanaugh: On the floor.

42
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,273
You're a fucking moron.

43
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,341
Don't fucking move.

44
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,809
Spread your fucking legs.

45
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,044
Don't fucking move.

46
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,314
What the fuck is wrong with you?

47
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,583
Don't you know how to listen?

48
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:26,019
Give me your fucking car,
will ya?

49
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,387
Don't move.

50
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,694
Rourke: He just ripped me
a new one.

51
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,429
Well, you don't know
where you are.

52
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:36,630
What, you're gonna
start on me now?

53
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:38,499
You're not in the bag anymore

54
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,100
wearing a tool belt and a baton,

55
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,035
extra ammo, cap stun.

56
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,070
I've patrolled some real shit.

57
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,506
This isn't gigs in
community service in personnel.

58
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,442
Weekends and holidays off,
straight days,

59
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:50,444
straight to the gym everyday.

60
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,447
I bet you like to spend
a lot of time in the tropics.

61
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,215
Health food, health shakes,

62
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,651
and now you want to be a cop.

63
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:59,386
This is not my first day
on the job.

64
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,121
Where's your ear piece?

65
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,523
I was fine.

66
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,857
What are you supposed to do
when they grab your shit?

67
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:04,825
I handled it.

68
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,494
Where's your gun?

69
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,702
Well, you're playing
a very different game here.

70
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:17,971
Get your head outta your ass
and look around.

71
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,941
On the north side of Broadway
you got Chicos Locos.

72
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,911
On the south side,
you got the White T's.

73
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,580
And popping up everywhere else
you got the Flying Dragons,

74
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:27,948
but do you know
where they all meet?

75
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,685
Right here,
right where you're standing.

76
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:33,353
I'm damn good at what I do.

77
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,088
We're all police officers.

78
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,457
That's what it says
on the ID card in our wallet.

79
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:40,894
But we are not all cops.

80
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,997
I'm a cop.

81
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,202
Okay.

82
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,673
You can buy the coffee.

83
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,511
Thug: Fuck you, bitch! 
 I'm gonna sue you

84
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:59,713
-You mother fucker!
-Detective: Hey, calm down.

85
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,519
(thug groans)
Huh? What was that?

86
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,054
(groans)
Cavanaugh: What was that?

87
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,221
You know, if you kill 'em,

88
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,990
I ain't doing the paperwork,
man.

89
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,058
You're doing it.

90
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,260
(grunting and groaning)

91
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,101
Detective, can you get rid
of this piece of shit please?

92
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,942
These dirty fucks.
You got some of that scale gel?

93
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,845
-Yeah.
-Here, knock yourself out.

94
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,016
I got plenty of it in my bag.

95
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,954
He deserved a beating.

96
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:46,126
He should be going
to the hospital or the morgue.

97
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,961
We don't do that anymore.

98
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,298
Woman: Senor ? Perdon.

99
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,235
-Yeah, sure.
-Woman: Senor, policia?

100
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,104
Senor, gracias por esta aqui.

101
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,039
De nada.

102
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,241
What was that?

103
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,677
Just came by to say
thanks for being here, man.

104
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,545
(sirens wail in distance)

105
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,718
Okay.

106
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,822
(techno music plays)

107
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,199
(clinking glasses)

108
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,140
-Hey.
-Hi.

109
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,008
How long have you been here?

110
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,476
A little while.

111
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,311
I was hoping to see you tonight.

112
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,817
(indistinct conversation)

113
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,853
Where's my drink?

114
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,932
Where were you last week?
I waited for you.

115
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,535
I was busy.

116
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,971
Busy?

117
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,072
Man: Move!

118
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,892
Here you go, Victor.

119
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,927
Simon, how the hell are you?

120
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,896
I'm okay, Victor.
I can't complain, you know?

121
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,231
One day at a time, man.
I don't want no trouble.

122
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,867
He's fucking with us.

123
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:37,037
(speaking foreign language)

124
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:40,841
Sorry.

125
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,077
I was just trying to help out
my boss. Man, you know?

126
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:47,781
(unintelligible speech)
You're fucking boss.

127
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,082
It's all there, man.

128
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,320
Take it all.
I ain't dying for nobody.

129
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,657
Marisol.

130
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:02,029
Marisol, you're looking
so beautiful tonight.

131
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:05,265
I mean, you look good enough
to eat. You know?

132
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,201
How are you doing?

133
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,940
Are you fucking him now?

134
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,407
Hmm?

135
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,277
Is this yours?

136
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,246
How much you
paying for this?

137
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,015
Come on, you can tell me.

138
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,718
How much he paying for you?

139
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,420
I mean, how much does a blow job

140
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,322
for somebody like this go for?

141
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,826
What?

142
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,964
Was that an
insensitive question to ask?

143
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,099
I mean,
you think she's a whore, right?

144
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:39,967
Is that...

145
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,770
Is that right?
She's a whore?

146
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,640
Isn't that what everybody
thinks? She's a whore?

147
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,077
Iceman: You all think
she's a whore, right?

148
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,215
Well, you're not a whore to me.

149
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,785
You know why?

150
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,223
Because I don't pay for it.

151
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:06,894
Let me show you.

152
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,271
(crying)

153
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,210
Ah, yeah.
That's my girl.

154
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,244
(yelps)

155
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,678
Come on!

156
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,815
Say, "Do that again."

157
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,216
Come on, show me.

158
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,517
(crying)

159
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:35,055
Hey, hey, hey.
Where do you think you're going?

160
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,223
Relax.

161
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,760
Hey, hey, hey. I said relax.

162
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:44,264
-Iceman: That's it.
-Don't be a hero.

163
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,567
Yeah, what's the matter?
Why are you crying?

164
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,969
Enjoy the show.

165
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:51,538
Come on.

166
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,240
Look at me!
Look at me!

167
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,507
(screaming and crying)

168
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,383
Tell them all
you're not a whore.

169
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,120
Tell them all
you're not a whore.

170
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,388
(screaming)

171
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,061
(gunshot)

172
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,395
(speaking foreign language)

173
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:16,463
(gunshot)

174
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,866
(screaming)

175
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,455
(gunshot)

176
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,927
(siren wailing)

177
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,266
I took you for a heathen.

178
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,002
St. Francis.
My old man gave it to me

179
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,970
when I got sworn in.

180
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,072
- That's sweet.
- Sweet?

181
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,874
Yes, that's nice.
That's a good thing.

182
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:04,844
He was born October, 4th,
the feast of St. Francis.

183
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,779
He carried it
while he pushed a radio card

184
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,681
and after 28 years,
he retired

185
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,351
and then he got whacked
by a deewee

186
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,922
on the Grand Gentral, helping
some lady fix a flat tire.

187
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,795
Lord, make me an instrument 
 of thy peace.

188
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,398
Where there is hatred, 
 let me sow love.

189
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,834
Where there is doubt, faith.

190
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,736
Where there is despair, hope.

191
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,005
Where there is darkness, light.

192
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,907
Where there's sadness, joy.

193
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,976
I'm very impressed.

194
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,779
St. Mary's,
all girl high school,

195
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,749
then on to
St. John's University.

196
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:43,917
What the hell
are you doing here?

197
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,352
You should be in law school.

198
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,154
I dropped out. Silly me.

199
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,490
I joined the department
to be a cop,

200
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,859
not some skirt behind a desk.

201
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,227
I get it.

202
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:58,031
Listen. Keep your eyes
and your ears open

203
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,199
and your mouth shut

204
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,101
and you're gonna be a good cop.

205
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,370
Play it smart.

206
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,438
That's the key to going far
in the department.

207
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,475
Do you play it smart?

208
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,345
Officer (over radio):
 Crime Sergeant 2876 on the air?

209
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:15,382
Crime Sergeant.

210
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,017
Crime Sergeant, 
 we have a confirmed

211
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,453
Memo was shot 
 in the Mexico Lindo Bar

212
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:25,192
to the confines of 119, 
 18909 112th Street.

213
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,361
That's 18909, 1-1-2 Street.

214
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,930
85 Duty Captain on the scene, 
 North Wood.

215
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,201
(radio chatter)

216
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,575
Okay, Mike.
What do you got?

217
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,543
Working on it.

218
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,013
No witnesses, robbery,
no cash in the till.

219
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:49,082
We're trying to locate
the owner, Wilber Moran.

220
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:53,186
I think somebody snatched
his shield and his ID.

221
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:57,657
(sobs)

222
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,562
Cavanaugh: Stan, it's okay.
It's okay.

223
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,596
Move!

224
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,169
(sobbing)

225
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,072
I told him to wait outside

226
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,075
and why the fuck didn't he
listen to me?

227
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,709
Stan, let's go outside. Come on.

228
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,279
You help Mike with
whatever he needs.

229
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,115
Come on. Let's talk outside.

230
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,285
(radio chatter)

231
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,091
Cavanaugh: All right, give.

232
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,493
I told him to sit in the car

233
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,862
and watch the place
until I got back.

234
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,565
I mean, the poor kid
must have got bored.

235
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,832
I don't know.

236
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,434
I mean, why else would he
go in the bar

237
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,969
without any backup?

238
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,605
What am I gonna tell his wife?

239
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,474
I don't know.

240
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,810
What are you gonna tell
the bosses?

241
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,412
Where the fuck were you?

242
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,116
Don't tell me you were out
chasing some skirt.

243
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,550
I'm fucking sorry, Chief.

244
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,220
God damn it, Stan!

245
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,322
Just tell me what to do.
I'll do whatever you say.

246
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,060
(sirens wailing)

247
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,495
Just don't talk to anybody.

248
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,434
(Stan sighs)

249
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:17,370
Wilber, take off your hat.

250
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:19,772
I'll take my hat off.

251
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:22,041
The bartender,
what's his name?

252
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,844
His name is, uh, Simon.
Simon Flores.

253
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,213
Phone number and address.

254
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,580
I don't know where he lives,

255
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,482
but you know, his cell phone,
I've been trying

256
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,017
to call it,
but he ain't been answering.

257
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,285
Mike: Come on, Wilber.

258
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,087
You don't know
your employees' address?

259
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,155
What?
I don't know where he lives.

260
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,889
He's a bartender,
he's off the books.

261
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,225
I don't know where he lives.

262
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:41,128
Any idea who might want
to rob your establishment?

263
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:43,563
No, I have no idea
who would do this.

264
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,597
I really don't.

265
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:45,998
Thanks, Mike.

266
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,835
You know, I really want
to help you guys, but...

267
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,337
(grunting)

268
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:53,773
Get up, Wilber.

269
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:54,841
Come on, Wilber.

270
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,709
Wilber: You can't do this.

271
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,778
You can't do this.

272
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,079
This ain't right.

273
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,716
Listen, I'm the fucking victim
here, remember?

274
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,585
I'm the guy that got robbed.

275
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,987
We just want a list
of your regulars

276
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,291
and Simon Flores,
the bartender's address.

277
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,726
I'm an American citizen.
I got my fucking rights.

278
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,663
I been in this neighborhood all
my life. You can't do this.

279
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,632
Forget your
Yankee-doodle-dandy bullshit!

280
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,867
We know about you, Wilber.

281
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,571
To us you're just a turd
floating on the top

282
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:28,175
of the bowl waiting for us
to give you the big flush.

283
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,009
Now, you're gonna tell
Detective Jablonsky

284
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,844
everything he wants to know,

285
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,646
otherwise we are going to
close down

286
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,418
this rat hole and every
shit infested bodega you got!

287
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:43,055
You got regulars! Think.

288
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,123
Come on!

289
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,194
All right,
I got a regular for you.

290
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,862
-All right, her name is Marisol.
-Cavanaugh: Who?

291
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,665
Marisol, Marisol Wahowadora.

292
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,368
She comes here once a week
on pay days.

293
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:56,903
I mean, you go see her.

294
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:57,904
I mean...

295
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:02,775
She plays with men for money.
She's a prostitute.

296
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,843
Thank you, Wilber.

297
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,188
Jesus!

298
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,490
You should be so lucky.

299
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:22,795
Meet me around the corner.
You can stay.

300
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,746
So you have a problem today?

301
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,949
Am I talking to
IAB Inspector Romanelli

302
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,251
or am I talking to Carmine?

303
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:47,186
You know, I don't know
what you got yourself into.

304
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,756
It's in Rosaso's office now.

305
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:50,723
You know me.

306
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,058
I'd say about
three cups of coffee.

307
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,460
I'm cool, Carmine. I'm clean.

308
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:56,596
Yeah, I know.
You're like a choir boy, right?

309
00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:00,467
I guess that makes me
the fucking Pope, right?

310
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,068
If this was on the record
you'd be in my office

311
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,704
right now with your delegate.

312
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,005
I'm sorry.

313
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,206
You're what?

314
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:11,344
You're sorry?
What are you doing?

315
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,414
Do you know we'll have
a ball with you?

316
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:16,015
Do you understand that?

317
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,250
They're gonna be all over this,

318
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:20,787
whatever this is and for what?

319
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,222
Because you get a cop
shot to death

320
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:26,759
while on duty, in some bar
and there's no witnesses

321
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:29,262
and it's partner is off
taking a powder?

322
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,097
And you're doing what?
You're the boss.

323
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,965
You're playing patty-cake
with this babe?

324
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,066
For what?
Because she wears a tin?

325
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,602
-What the fuck?
-Are you fucking stupid?

326
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,136
What the fuck
are you talking about?

327
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,938
Don't be a cluck.
Use your fucking head.

328
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,840
It's not about truth,
is it?

329
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,710
It's about how things look.
Do you understand?

330
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,945
How we're perceived.

331
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,780
It's about decorum, huh?

332
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,450
Yeah.

333
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,185
Well, give me a little smoke
and mirrors, will ya?

334
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,654
Give me something.

335
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:56,556
Because right now,
I can't believe

336
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,857
you ever fucking worked for me.

337
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,028
You're a first line supervisor,
pal.

338
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,095
That's bullshit.

339
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,332
Hey, grow the fuck up!
It's your job!

340
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,568
Bad shit happens,
you hold the bag, pal.

341
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,937
That's the gig.
You signed on.

342
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,541
And these bosses,
they need to throw one

343
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,709
to the lions, they give fuck all
about you, me,

344
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:17,844
or the first marine.

345
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,047
Get back to work.

346
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,159
- I'm driving.
- Where we going?

347
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,461
Let's go for coffee.

348
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,867
(car engine starts)

349
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,138
Fuck it! We still got
a big deal to do tonight.

350
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:47,674
The rest of them, forget it.

351
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,542
We know where everybody lives
in this neighborhood

352
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:52,078
and we know where 
 their babies sleep.

353
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,045
They ain't gonna say shit.

354
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,783
It's the loners
you got to look out for.

355
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,651
Flores, the bartender.

356
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:02,689
Marisol.

357
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:13,433
Marisol.

358
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,670
Marisol.

359
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:19,706
(neck cracks)

360
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:23,510
There's only so many places
she can go.

361
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,513
(water running)

362
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,418
She ain't leaving.

363
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,523
She ain't leaving
because she knows.

364
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,491
She knows how it is.

365
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,998
She's gonna wait for you.

366
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,971
She's gonna wait for you!

367
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:58,144
But you gotta clean
this shit up.

368
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:04,484
You gotta clean this shit up.

369
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,993
You gotta clean this shit up!

370
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,965
So clean it up.

371
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:33,980
(water running)

372
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:39,151
(footsteps)

373
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:45,024
(sirens wailing)

374
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:51,263
- Hey, babe.
- What's up, baby?

375
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,065
What's up, handsome?

376
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,367
You smell good.

377
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,503
Thank you.

378
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,505
I bet you taste even better.

379
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:00,740
I bet you taste even better.

380
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,742
You gonna lend me a sample?

381
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:09,616
(laughing)

382
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:14,954
-Come with me. Take off work.
-Uh-um.

383
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,156
-Take off work, let's go.
-I can't, I can't.

384
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,564
(speaking foreign language)

385
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:25,965
Nothing.
(speaks in foreign language)

386
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,867
-Can I help you with something?
-Who the fuck is this guy?

387
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,135
Who the fuck are you
raising your voice?

388
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,436
(speaking foreign language)

389
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,771
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

390
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,172
-Who is this guy?
-Who is this fucking guy?

391
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,475
What the fuck is going on
over here?

392
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:37,777
Don't fuck with my wife!

393
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,512
Yeah, keep backing up.
Keep backing up. Yeah, get back!

394
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:41,147
Carlos: Get this fucking guy
out of here.

395
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,049
(yelling and arguing)

396
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,017
Get this fucking guy
out of here.

397
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,453
What are you doing
messing with my wife?

398
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,022
Carlos, come on.

399
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,626
Did you get what you want?

400
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:03,636
What the hell was that?

401
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,704
Come in the back.

402
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,405
Let me make you some coffee.

403
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,940
-I'll get you a coffee.
-Sure.

404
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,182
Maria, lo cafe por favor?

405
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,187
What was that there?

406
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,723
Carlos thought his wife
is cheating on him.

407
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:24,757
Is she?

408
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,295
They call him Biano Cholo.

409
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,831
He runs with Chicos Locos.

410
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,265
(speaking foreign language)

411
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:38,004
Any problems you call me.
You know that.

412
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,607
Thank you.

413
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,809
Is everything okay?

414
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,977
Are you still sleeping
with your wife?

415
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,114
No, that's over.

416
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,983
Good for you.

417
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,354
You have a problem,
call me.

418
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,623
Okay.

419
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,230
(sighs)

420
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:05,832
(phone ringing)

421
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:09,602
I'm working.
Make it quick.

422
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:11,437
The kids need some money.

423
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,640
I mailed you a check
and you cashed it.

424
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:15,675
My brother Anthony's wedding,
okay?

425
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:16,976
The girls need new dresses.

426
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,278
They need new shoes
and if you could help out

427
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,246
with the tickets?

428
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:21,948
I take care of my girls.

429
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,115
Tell them I'll call them
in the morning.

430
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,383
Okay, if you can't help
with the tickets

431
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,052
then I can ask Greg, all right?

432
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,219
He'll do it.

433
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,354
Hello?

434
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,490
Who's that? The Devil?

435
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,359
No, that's the devil's sister.

436
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:36,696
(Latin music)

437
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,234
(sighs)

438
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,405
Victor, my friend.
Welcome.

439
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,007
(speaking foreign language)

440
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,543
Allow me to introduce
your hostess, Rosanna.

441
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:53,279
(greets in foreign language)

442
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,613
Rosanna.

443
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:00,286
As always, Victor,
the meal is on the house.

444
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,654
Gracias.

445
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,656
(speaking foreign language)

446
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,226
Hey Jefferson,
let me ask you a question.

447
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:09,696
Do you tap that?

448
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,263
No, no, not me, Victor.

449
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,265
Come on, man, be honest.

450
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,701
Convince me.

451
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:15,968
No, Victor, I'm not lying.

452
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:17,536
You mean to tell me
you didn't fuck that?

453
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,838
All right, look Victor.

454
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,372
I was planning on fucking that.

455
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:21,540
I just haven't had
the chance yet.

456
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,810
My man, Jefferson.
You a pimp now.

457
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:28,480
Because if I find out
that you fucked her,

458
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:33,920
and you lied to me and I'm
fucking your sloppy seconds,

459
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:36,856
I'm gonna cut
your fucking balls off

460
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:41,027
and I'm gonna feed them to you
piece by piece.

461
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,994
Hey, Jefferson.

462
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,431
I'm curious, man. You ever try
to suck your own dick?

463
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,866
(laughing)

464
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,768
I mean, he looks like
the kind of guy

465
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:49,836
that would try that, no?

466
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:52,004
You know,
bend over as far as you can,

467
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,740
but you can't quite get it.

468
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:55,708
That's life, ain't it?

469
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:57,043
You never quite get there.

470
00:27:57,076 --> 00:28:00,312
Like that fucking jacket
you got on.

471
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,948
Never quite get there.

472
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,086
I don't know what
you're gonna do about it?

473
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,287
You smiling?

474
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:10,790
Is he smiling at you?

475
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:13,826
You want to ask him for a date?

476
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,429
You don't ask me for a date,
do you?

477
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,334
I might say yes.

478
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,005
And then what are you gonna do?

479
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,776
(horn honking)

480
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,250
(speaking foreign language)

481
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,791
- What are you two doing here?
- We like the coffee jugs.

482
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:48,928
That's very funny.
You're gonna get me killed.

483
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,696
Overreacting a bit?

484
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,264
Simon Flores, he's a bartender.

485
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:53,766
-You know him?
-No.

486
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,267
No, that quick, no.

487
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:57,603
Since when you start hanging out
with the Victor Vargas crowd?

488
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,138
Hey, I'm just a man
running a business.

489
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,707
They come in here to eat
just like everybody else.

490
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,342
Well, eating is not a crime,

491
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:06,813
but murder, rape, extortion.

492
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,180
See where I'm going here?

493
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,123
Is there a problem, officers?

494
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:21,560
I know you. I know Nester,
Iceman.

495
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,395
Is this our friend
from the bakery?

496
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,132
What's your name,
shit-for-brains?

497
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:30,069
Tito Morales.

498
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:36,042
Oh, I'm sorry, did you
want to see a drivers license?

499
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:38,144
- How old are you, Tito?
- Twenty-four.

500
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:41,213
- Think he'll make his 25th?
- No, not this one.

501
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,315
There's a Mexican restaurant
on Broadway.

502
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:45,051
You know it?

503
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:49,121
We don't hang with Mexicans.

504
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:51,290
I thought all you amigos 
hung together.

505
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:53,425
Only when we're
banging your mama.

506
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,560
(laughing)

507
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,399
Sit down, asshole!

508
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:01,834
(speaking foreign language)

509
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:10,509
And there is some bad shit
that went down there tonight.

510
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,511
What are you even doing here,
man?

511
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,581
This is not your neighborhood.

512
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:18,550
Some shit went down,
we can take care of it,

513
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:19,919
but you don't know these people.

514
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:23,856
You can't even read the menu
in here, man.

515
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,457
(speaking foreign language)

516
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:30,930
I'm sure Sergeant Cavanaugh here
is just going his job.

517
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:32,464
Victor: Ain't that right, Sarge?

518
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,267
So when they make
you a Sergeant,

519
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:38,570
they give you this piece of ass
to hang around with?

520
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,539
Victor: Apparently.

521
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,041
Tonight, sweetheart...

522
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:46,545
(speaking foreign language)

523
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,247
-Whoo.
-Rourke: Right.

524
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,451
Sooner or later, we're gonna
know what you know.

525
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:54,286
Let's hope you don't know much.

526
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,421
Let's go.

527
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:37,029
Did you see the video?

528
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:43,402
That was my father's
candy store.

529
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:54,646
Officer (over radio):
 12-8-16, 201 please?

530
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,049
(radio chatter continues)

531
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,627
(indistinct radio conversation)

532
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:24,310
(moaning and yelling)

533
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:32,318
Yes, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

534
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,291
You bitch!
This is how you treat me?

535
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:40,692
I take care of you.
I give you a life,

536
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:44,096
and this is how you treat me
with this fucking guy!

537
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,766
You fuck my wife?
You fucking dick!

538
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,268
Ah! Tito!

539
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,973
Get off him!

540
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,476
(groaning)

541
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,478
Officer (over radio):
 Crime Sergeant, in the motel.

542
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,913
14907 Historia Boulevard. 
(siren wails)

543
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:03,949
14907 Historia Boulevard.

544
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,917
It's a possible DOA.

545
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:09,555
You are required to proceed.

546
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,123
(sirens wailing)

547
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,629
You know him?

548
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:20,099
His name is Carlos.
He runs a bakery in Lidia's.

549
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,434
Very popular with the amigos .
Great coffee.

550
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:24,903
Good guy,
always talking about his kids.

551
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,538
Yeah, from his first wife.

552
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:27,806
Illegal?
(phone ringing)

553
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,875
Yeah, he is a tax payer.

554
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:31,377
-Hello?
-Lisa: See?

555
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,244
Shit!

556
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:33,445
Yeah,
I'm surprised you answered.

557
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,880
I called you earlier
from Greg's office

558
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:36,515
-you didn't even answer.
-No, I'm working.

559
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,784
Your stuff.
You got to get it out of here.

560
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,353
Just stick it in a box
and throw it in the garage.

561
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,055
In a box?
There's a lot of stuff.

562
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:44,723
Hey, why don't you get
the tooth fairy to help you?

563
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:45,791
(laughing)

564
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,926
You are such an asshole,
you know?

565
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,428
I'm just curious.
What do you guys do for fun?

566
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,263
-Floss each other's teeth?
 -This is all very funny to you,

567
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:52,764
but listen to me, TC.

568
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,768
Greg is moving in here, soon.
Okay?

569
00:33:56,802 --> 00:34:00,038
- I need you to take your stuff.
- What did you say?

570
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:03,342
Yeah. You heard me,
he's moving in.

571
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,576
Listen, you want to fuck
that four-eyed geek,

572
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,078
that's up to you
but you're not gonna do it

573
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:08,514
in my house while
my kids are still living there.

574
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,481
Your house? Really?

575
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:11,717
You know what,
I'm glad I made this decision.

576
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,851
Listen to me, you bitch!

577
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,920
Oh, no, no, no.
We're not doing that.

578
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:16,021
Hello?

579
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,389
Man: Let's do business.

580
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:19,891
Right here, right here.
Are we doing this or not, man?

581
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,660
(speaking foreign language)

582
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:24,062
English, English.

583
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:26,332
We ain't got no subtitles man,
come on.

584
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:28,734
What the fuck
are you gonna do about it?

585
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,169
Come on, talk to your man.

586
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:31,403
(speaking foreign language)

587
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:33,004
See, your guy is tripping
over here, man.

588
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,740
Tell him to fucking relax.

589
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,742
-I don't need to relax.
-You got to give me the money.

590
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:37,876
We set this shit off right now.

591
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,010
I'm taking care
of fucking business.

592
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:40,146
Relax, bro.

593
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,747
You're getting
all fucking crazy here.

594
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:44,583
I hate this shit.

595
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:47,353
We got bedbugs in our house.

596
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:52,057
Jap gangsters 
 in their $500 suits

597
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,627
making deals with these niggers
 on our streets.

598
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,197
This neighborhood
is going to shit.

599
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,431
With everything 
 going down tonight,

600
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:01,300
I got to deal 
 with this shit now.

601
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:11,343
Man, what the fuck?

602
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:13,979
You see we trying
to get out of here.

603
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:15,714
Move your fucking car.

604
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,082
Hey, yo. What's up?

605
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,250
Gang member:
Get back in the car.

606
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:20,686
We're trying to move this shit,
come on, man.

607
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,288
Is this your shit here?

608
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:23,789
Yo, you blocking.

609
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:24,956
Am I blocking you?

610
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,892
Yes, you are, man.
What the fuck?

611
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,027
This motherfucker's drunk.

612
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,529
You sure you guys ain't lost?

613
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,264
What the fuck? Do you map quest
or some shit?

614
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,566
-Get out of here.
-You starting some shit?

615
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,235
Am I in your way?

616
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:37,469
What the fuck do you think?

617
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:39,605
Get your ass in the car
and go, man.

618
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,341
Maybe you're in my way.

619
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,909
What do you think about that?

620
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,577
You wanna find out?

621
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:48,814
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, calm down.

622
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,649
I'm just fucking with you.

623
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,983
Gang member: No, nah-uh.

624
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,319
Yeah, I'm just fucking with you.

625
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:54,753
This is not the day to be
fucking with me.

626
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,788
I'm fucking with you, man.
That's how we do it here, man.

627
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:57,689
I'm fucking with you.

628
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:59,157
I'll tell you what,
let me move it.

629
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:00,559
Let me move it.

630
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,561
(gunshots)

631
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,403
(chuckling)

632
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,641
(spits)

633
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,743
(dogs barking)

634
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,349
You're one sick fuck.

635
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,486
Lisa (over phone): You've got 
 the nerve to be pissed off...

636
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,355
What did you expect to happen?

637
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:30,689
Why are you haunting me tonight?

638
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,157
I mean,
I know you say no marriage

639
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,592
can survive communication.

640
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,994
Well, you know,
nobody can be married

641
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,663
to you period.
Period.

642
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:38,830
Well, nobody is.

643
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,367
I liked you, man.
I loved you.

644
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,235
I laughed at your jokes.

645
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:45,271
I was good to you. What the fuck
is wrong with you?

646
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:47,205
Do you even know
what I do for a living?

647
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,540
While you and your friends
are eating

648
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:50,342
your cucumber sandwiches,
I got to tell some family

649
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:52,744
why grandma got her throat slit
by some crackhead.

650
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:54,646
It's all about your work. 
 Do you understand?

651
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,715
Do you understand how you
blew this marriage?

652
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,784
I mean,
the shit that I put up with.

653
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,592
Victor: Come on over 
 and introduce it.

654
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,594
I'm the fucking sweet king, 
 brother .

655
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,496
Come on, man. 
 Who you talking to?

656
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:11,530
(speaking foreign language)

657
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:15,033
In the street they're paying
like 45.

658
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,868
I don't give a fuck
about the street.

659
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,236
Man, come on.

660
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,805
Am I a fucking kid or what?

661
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,273
We go way back.

662
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:23,275
Look, I hate fucking charities,
alright.

663
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:27,245
Three fucking bags of sweets,
40 a bag.

664
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:28,714
Call it even.

665
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:31,783
We good?

666
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:33,819
Okay, okay.

667
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,687
(church bell ringing)

668
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,991
Priest: I heard the siren
from the rectory.

669
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,028
A disease is spreading, padre ,
you know?

670
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,296
Priest: All these killings?

671
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,332
Yeah, it's good for business,
yours and mine.

672
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:47,599
You don't really believe that.

673
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,601
The good citizens of this place
don't give a shit

674
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:52,003
unless it happens
in their backyard.

675
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:53,171
As long as Mrs. Manacotti

676
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,806
can walk down the street
in Howard Beach,

677
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,876
nobody gives a fuck if Jose gets
his brains blown out in Jamaica.

678
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,110
You're wrong, TC.

679
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:00,846
Am I?

680
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:01,913
Are you guys any better?

681
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,915
You got a church in this
neighborhood with no roof,

682
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:04,516
with no floor.

683
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,019
I can go less than one mile away
the other side of the tracks

684
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:10,956
and their making over 50 grand
on their Sunday collection.

685
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:11,990
If you're looking for a fight,

686
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,258
you ain't gonna get one here
tonight.

687
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,494
I lost a man tonight!

688
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:19,264
I know his wife.
I know his kids.

689
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,032
He's got a brother on the job

690
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,534
and he was 38 years old.

691
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,705
I'm sorry guys.

692
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,039
What's his name?

693
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:30,542
Delgado. Michael Delgado.

694
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,149
Play by the rules officer.

695
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,051
Get the job done,

696
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:43,254
but don't cross any lines.

697
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:44,390
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

698
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:45,524
You know what I mean,

699
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:46,758
and watch your language.

700
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,394
Lines? Rules?

701
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:49,795
There are no rules.

702
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,463
You walk around that college
just to save your own ass.

703
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:54,833
I said watch your language!

704
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:59,070
Play by the rules, TC.

705
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:00,806
It's the only thing that
separates us

706
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,340
from the savages.

707
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:11,049
(radio chatter)

708
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:20,726
I never heard anyone
treat you like that.

709
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:23,529
(radio chatter)
Yeah, you never met my ex wife.

710
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,465
What's that about?

711
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:33,872
He's heard my confession
over the years.

712
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:38,076
IAB. He knows you by
your first name.

713
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,110
Yeah, so?

714
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:40,879
You gonna write a report?

715
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,782
What are you? A cheese eater?
You want a slice of Swiss?

716
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,217
Where do you get off
talking to me like that?

717
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,653
I get it, TC.

718
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:48,887
They're killing cops out there.

719
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:55,461
Nobody's safe.
So let's take care of this.

720
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,395
I'm not that cop anymore

721
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,698
and you're not
gonna be that cop.

722
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,900
You have to play it straight.

723
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,869
That's the way you get through
nights like tonight.

724
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,604
That's the way you get through
all the nights.

725
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,940
That's the difference between us
and the perps.

726
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:14,713
Are you confessing to me now?

727
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,749
I don't know.
Are you wearing a wire?

728
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,586
You wanna frisk me to find out?

729
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:24,856
(phone ringing)

730
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,658
Cavanaugh.

731
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,429
Yeah, we'll be there
in ten minutes.

732
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,705
Victor: What the fuck 
 are you saying?

733
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:42,641
They found this motherfucker?

734
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:43,775
No, man. Fuck that!

735
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:46,077
If this motherfucker talks,
we're dead.

736
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,313
(speaking foreign language)

737
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:50,048
You gotta kill
this motherfucker!

738
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:52,551
(speaking foreign language)

739
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:55,320
This is what
I'm fucking paying you for!

740
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:56,788
Son of a bitch!

741
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,262
-Where is he?
-Room three.

742
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,698
All right, Williams, you're
gonna be the customs agent.

743
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:07,866
(bell rings)
Williams: Okay.

744
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:09,668
Mike: I didn't hear that.
I'm outta here.

745
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,069
All right,
we're going to room three.

746
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:18,309
Simon, this is Arthur Turner,
US Customs Agent.

747
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:20,846
He wants to offer you
a proposition.

748
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,881
Mr. Flores,
the United States government

749
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,282
is willing to overlook the fact
that you

750
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,684
entered this country illegally.

751
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:29,354
All we have to do is help
Sergeant Cavanaugh.

752
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:31,489
I don't do law a favor.

753
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:33,659
That's funny.
You're a funny guy.

754
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:34,960
Let's see how funny you are

755
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,395
when you get off the
fucking plane in El Salvador.

756
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,697
I'll send you a postcard.

757
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,065
Williams: That would be nice,
of course,

758
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:41,833
that is if you ever get there.

759
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:44,469
See, you'll be spending a lot
of time in the joint first.

760
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,371
With the general population.

761
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:49,440
Yeah, you'll get to hang
with your buddies,

762
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:50,842
play dominoes.

763
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:53,044
Say adios to your amigos .

764
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,880
How does that sound?

765
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57,949
All right, I'll help you.
What happens to me?

766
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,887
We'll set you up out west,
new identity.

767
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,125
Do you have some coffee?
Can I have some coffee?

768
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:09,394
Tell me what happened
from the beginning.

769
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:11,930
Simon: I'll talk after
I talk to my lawyer.

770
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:15,133
(Cavanaugh laughs)
Simon, you are so full of shit.

771
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,936
You got three bench warrants
in Suffolk County.

772
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,638
Criminal possession
of stolen property,

773
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:21,773
grand larceny, resisting arrest.

774
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:23,074
I mean,
are you fucking shitting me?

775
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:24,509
All right, let's take this guy
out of here.

776
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,611
Who wants COT?

777
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:27,412
-I'll take him.
-No, no, no, no.

778
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:28,814
You know what?
Rourke, you go with him.

779
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:30,448
No, no. I got him. It's okay.
No, I got him. I got him.

780
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:31,683
It's a two man job.

781
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:33,952
-Let's not fuck this one up.
-Stan: All right.

782
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:03,281
(door creaks)

783
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:10,889
How long does it take
to close this place, Wilber?

784
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,290
I've been waiting here
all night.

785
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:13,458
I didn't know you were out here.

786
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:14,826
You know I wouldn't
make you wait for me.

787
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,094
You didn't know I was
coming here?

788
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:18,329
-Wilber: No.
-You know we got some shit

789
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:19,430
to talk about, right?

790
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:21,266
I know.
It's fucked up.

791
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:22,634
Iceman: Yeah.

792
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:24,703
I heard you talked
to our friends before.

793
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:28,139
I didn't talk to them.
They talked to me.

794
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,909
They were there, but
I didn't say nothing to them.

795
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,144
You didn't say nothing
to those cops?

796
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:34,045
No, as a matter of fact,

797
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,981
I told them all to
go fuck themselves.

798
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:37,649
Well, because the way
I look at it, Wilber

799
00:43:37,683 --> 00:43:39,985
if you said anything,
you got two choices.

800
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,621
I can fucking kill you...

801
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,859
...or I could fuck you
in the ass.

802
00:43:47,893 --> 00:43:49,961
Why you always got to
fuck with me, man?

803
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:50,962
(laughing)

804
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,098
Listen, no listen.
Now, look at me.

805
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,300
-Look at me.
-What?

806
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,802
Seriously, you gotta be careful.

807
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:58,169
They're coming down hard
on everybody tonight

808
00:43:58,203 --> 00:44:00,038
so you gotta keep
your mouth shut, right?

809
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:03,374
You ain't got to worry about me.
You know that. Come on.

810
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:05,010
All right.
Look at me real good.

811
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:07,112
Look at my good eye.
(laughing)

812
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,515
You ain't got to worry about me.
You know that.

813
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:11,717
I'm just checking.
I'm checking.

814
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,018
I know you're good.
You're straight.

815
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:14,385
You're gonna keep
your mouth shut though, right?

816
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:15,887
You got my word.

817
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:17,689
-You have a nice Christmas.
-You too, man.

818
00:44:17,723 --> 00:44:18,957
-All right?
-You and your family.

819
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,458
Oh, hey.
One more thing that I forgot.

820
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,293
What?
(slash)

821
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:29,735
Now I know
you ain't gonna say nothing.

822
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:52,023
Hey,
I think we're being followed.

823
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:58,463
No. No, man.
We're all right. We're cool.

824
00:44:58,496 --> 00:44:59,831
(horn honking)

825
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,474
Ah, shit.

826
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:12,878
Ah, man.
I gotta take a piss bad.

827
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:14,412
You wanna pull over?

828
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:28,159
Officer (over radio): ...119, 
 11605 Sutter Boulevard.

829
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:31,930
Bodega, 
 a 24 DOA, confirmed dead.

830
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:33,965
(gunshot)

831
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:35,767
Oh, what the fuck, man!
(gunshot)

832
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:52,250
1013, 1013.
B-Way and 138.

833
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:54,853
Officer down.
We need a bus, now!

834
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:57,455
Officer (over radio):
 Sergeant, what unit is this?

835
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:58,023
What unit is this?

836
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:02,027
No response. Single 1013. 
 138 Broadway .

837
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,895
That's over the air. 
 138 Broadway,

838
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,730
119, shots fired.

839
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,965
Over the air.

840
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:24,983
Inspector. I was just
about to call your office.

841
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:27,518
We snagged a lead
in the Delgado shooting.

842
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:29,120
The bartender.

843
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:31,823
He's tight as a clam now,
but we're gonna open him up.

844
00:46:31,857 --> 00:46:32,991
The jagg-off snagged
a bench warrant

845
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:35,426
for a CPSP.
I got Jablonsky and Rourke

846
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,263
transporting him out to
Suffolk County now.

847
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:41,466
Rourke?

848
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,268
Yeah, Rourke.

849
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,502
The babe with the tin.

850
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:45,971
She's turning into a cop.

851
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:48,539
She's smart. She's tough.

852
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:50,175
She's gonna be a star.

853
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:52,610
Well, she had a great boss.

854
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,013
I had a great boss.

855
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:00,218
What's the matter, Carmine?

856
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:04,689
We just had another one.

857
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:05,991
Shot.

858
00:47:07,192 --> 00:47:08,759
Jesus, where?

859
00:47:08,793 --> 00:47:10,295
Off the E-Way.

860
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:13,031
The 116.

861
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:16,101
In the back of the head.

862
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:19,137
116? What was his name?

863
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,108
Her name.

864
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,228
(siren wailing)

865
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,166
He was like, 5'7"-5'8"
Spanish dude.

866
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,935
He came out of a dark sedan,

867
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:51,502
but, you know,
it happened so quick.

868
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:56,107
I couldn't see. I don't know
what the fuck it was.

869
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,479
TC, I'm sorry.
It was all my fault, man.

870
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:02,847
What did you do, Stan?

871
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,982
All I did was ask her
to pull over

872
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:05,216
so I could take a piss.
That was it.

873
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,217
What did you do?

874
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:07,752
That was it
and a sedan came by,

875
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:08,819
this guy started shooting.

876
00:48:08,853 --> 00:48:10,655
That was it.
I wanted to take a piss.

877
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:11,889
What did you do?
What did you do?

878
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:13,358
That was it, man.

879
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,226
(screaming and yelling)

880
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:21,466
Officer: Get him
out of the crime scene.

881
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,114
Officer: Don't touch the car.

882
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:42,920
(phone ringing)

883
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:49,294
I can't talk now.

884
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:57,868
Mike: Go home.

885
00:48:57,902 --> 00:48:59,504
We can take care of this.

886
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:00,871
She was doing it right.

887
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:03,341
She was gonna be
one of the good ones.

888
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:04,475
(phone ringing)

889
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:06,577
Mike: It's me.

890
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,380
Yeah, McDermot.

891
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:11,616
All right.

892
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:14,419
No, no, no.
He's with me.

893
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:15,653
Yeah, ten minutes.

894
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:18,489
No, go on. Go on.

895
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:20,258
Good job, thanks.

896
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,560
Wilber Moran
just bought the farm.

897
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:25,430
There was a robbery
outside one of his bodegas.

898
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,931
Witnesses? Leads?

899
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,299
Caught. They all beat feet.

900
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,901
This may be something
or it may be bullshit.

901
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:33,304
That whore, Marisol,
was hanging around

902
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:35,073
with this asshole Hector
who worked

903
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:37,175
out of this place
on 138th Street.

904
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:40,145
-I know where that is.
-Wait, wait, wait, Tommy.

905
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:41,812
We can take care of this.

906
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:44,782
-Yeah.
-What are you gonna do?

907
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,484
Do you really want to know?

908
00:49:51,256 --> 00:49:53,558
It all goes down tonight.
Okay.

909
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:55,593
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

910
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:57,628
Hey, you ready for tonight?

911
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:58,863
Yeah, we all straight, man.

912
00:49:58,896 --> 00:50:01,532
This is for our cop friend.

913
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,502
Oh, fuck this, Victor.

914
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:07,972
Fucking too generous.
He's not worth that much.

915
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,740
What about the bitch
at the bar?

916
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:11,442
I got a line on her.

917
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:13,644
I'm gonna take care
of Marisol myself.

918
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:15,680
Don't worry about anything.

919
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:16,847
When have you ever known me

920
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:18,416
not to fucking worry
about anything, huh?

921
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:21,286
You do realize how fucking big
this deal is tonight,

922
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:22,253
don't you?

923
00:50:22,287 --> 00:50:23,754
You take my share,
how about that?

924
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:25,756
I'm gonna do this shit for fun.

925
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:29,727
That's why I'm so good, man.

926
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,429
You better be better than good.

927
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:34,999
Tonight,
you better be fucking great.

928
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,767
You understand?

929
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:38,736
You fuck.

930
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:39,804
(laughing)

931
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:45,276
My turn, Vargas. My turn.

932
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,085
(footsteps)

933
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:40,398
(moaning)

934
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:48,539
Shit.
(laughing)

935
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:50,675
Hola, Hector.

936
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,411
I haven't seen you in a while.

937
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:57,182
-Take a walk, sweetheart.
-No, no, no, baby. Hold on.

938
00:51:57,215 --> 00:51:59,950
Take a good look, chief.

939
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:01,319
This is number one, grade A,

940
00:52:01,352 --> 00:52:03,821
government inspected ass.

941
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:07,792
She'll give it to you
anyway you want, Sergeant.

942
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:12,029
Hey, officer, do you want me...
(speaks foreign language)

943
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:13,931
I'll suck your cock real good.

944
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,766
Right? I'm good. You like it?

945
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:21,372
Tell me the truth.
(speaks foreign language)

946
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:25,042
Why don't you just get off
his back? Come on.

947
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,144
You want to touch it
or do you want me

948
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:29,747
to take my dress off right here,
maybe?

949
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,016
I don't need a fucking moron
to suck my cock.

950
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:34,585
(speaks in foreign language)

951
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,120
Chief, you know?

952
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:41,559
I think me and you,
I think we're the same.

953
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:45,963
You keep people safe.
I keep them happy.

954
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,666
I'll make you feel
like a real man.

955
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,635
Marisol? You know her?

956
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,169
No, man, I don't.

957
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:53,938
I don't got no Latin ass.

958
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:56,707
I got black ass, white ass,
chink ass

959
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:59,244
and a dot head bitch.

960
00:52:59,277 --> 00:53:01,279
You're the United
fucking Nations, aren't you?

961
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:03,781
Yeah, I'm a peacemaker.

962
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:04,949
You want a piece?

963
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,053
So you don't know shit.
Who the fuck does?

964
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:12,457
Does that lone biker, Carl?

965
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,191
He's got a chop shop down town.

966
00:53:14,225 --> 00:53:17,395
Right, he loves the Latin pussy.

967
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,401
Chief...

968
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:25,836
Come back anytime.

969
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,572
I want, you love.

970
00:53:27,605 --> 00:53:30,608
Oh, I'll be back.
You can guarantee it.

971
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:31,776
Get upstairs.

972
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,717
(radio chatter)

973
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,692
(door slams)

974
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:53,831
-Hey, Stanley.
-Hey.

975
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,300
You looking for
a little pussy tonight?

976
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,867
No, I don't want no pussy.
I want my money.

977
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:58,068
Where's Vargas?

978
00:53:58,102 --> 00:54:00,237
Oh, he couldn't make it,

979
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:03,741
but he asked me
to give this to you, you know?

980
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,512
Yeah, we needed you
to take care of Simon,

981
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:08,979
but what you did
to that lady cop...

982
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:11,048
That was some bad ass shit.

983
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,950
I wouldn't want
to fuck with you, man.

984
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,519
All my money's not here.

985
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:16,454
This isn't all
the fucking money!

986
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:18,222
-Where is it?
-Oh, you got to relax.

987
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,557
Listen, you spic bastard.

988
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,492
I'll fucking skin you
and Vargas alive

989
00:54:21,526 --> 00:54:23,528
if I don't get my fucking money.

990
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:24,795
(stabbing)

991
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:28,466
See, what's funny is...

992
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:34,038
Tonight the only one left who
knows what went down is you.

993
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:40,378
You make too much noise.

994
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,352
I fucked up my jacket.

995
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,248
Still chasing the Latin gash,
Carl?

996
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:19,584
I lost two men tonight.

997
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:22,019
-I'm eating dinner.
-Dinner is over, Carl!

998
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,754
Take it easy.

999
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:25,390
I'm looking for a whore
named Marisol.

1000
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:26,857
I don't know her.
I can't help you.

1001
00:55:26,891 --> 00:55:30,928
Well, maybe I should just burn
this fucking place down, Carl!

1002
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:32,530
I can point you
in the right direction.

1003
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:34,331
Which direction would that be,
Carl?

1004
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:36,100
That would be a dump
in Jackson Heights.

1005
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:39,103
There's a flea bag motel.
They run whores out the back.

1006
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:42,206
Most of the clientel
is Spanish dudes.

1007
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:44,709
Run by a prick named Iceman.

1008
00:55:46,411 --> 00:55:48,446
Iceman's a sick fuck.

1009
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,748
-Are we even?
-Fuck you, Carl.

1010
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:55,285
(phone ringing)

1011
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:56,421
What?

1012
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:57,788
Mike: They found Jablonsky dead.

1013
00:55:57,822 --> 00:55:59,256
What the hell
are you talking about?

1014
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,391
Mike: Somebody stabbed him.

1015
00:56:00,425 --> 00:56:01,692
He's been stabbed
a couple of times.

1016
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:03,694
Look, everybody 
 and his brother is down here.

1017
00:56:03,728 --> 00:56:05,195
All right, 
 I'm behind Vernon Boulevard,

1018
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:07,097
31st Street, 
 behind the lumber yard.

1019
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:08,566
Just get here, man.

1020
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:15,873
(sirens wailing)

1021
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:19,444
(radio chatter)

1022
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:25,349
Jablonsky's phone has
got Vargas number in it.

1023
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,517
And fucking
Internal Affairs rats

1024
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:28,118
have been out here all night
watching me

1025
00:56:28,152 --> 00:56:29,286
and they're looking for you.

1026
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:30,555
They want to know why they got

1027
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:31,889
two fucking bosses
that don't know why

1028
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:34,391
three of their guys
get killed in one night.

1029
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:35,760
So what do you want to do?

1030
00:56:35,793 --> 00:56:38,896
You got to buy me 20 minutes.
I got a lead on Marisol.

1031
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:40,064
All right, all right.

1032
00:56:40,097 --> 00:56:41,198
All right, where I'm going,

1033
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,600
I'm going to text you
the address.

1034
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:44,201
I need you there in 20 minutes.

1035
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,903
All right, don't fuck me.

1036
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:54,278
We can't find Cavanaugh.

1037
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:55,680
-Hmm.
-We can't find him.

1038
00:56:57,214 --> 00:56:58,449
A couple of minutes, will ya?

1039
00:56:58,483 --> 00:56:59,717
He's one of my guys.

1040
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,718
What? You gonna kick me out?

1041
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:01,952
No, no, no.
Ten minutes.

1042
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:04,955
Cavanaugh, my office!

1043
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:07,892
In 15 minutes!

1044
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:52,136
-Can I talk to her?
-John: She's all yours.

1045
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:56,373
Let's not worry about that now.

1046
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:57,808
When was the last time you used?

1047
00:57:57,842 --> 00:57:59,076
A few hours ago.

1048
00:57:59,109 --> 00:57:59,977
You're gonna tell me what I need

1049
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:02,580
to know
and you're gonna tell me now.

1050
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:05,583
I know who you want
and what you want her for.

1051
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:07,251
She won't talk.

1052
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:08,753
Let me worry about that.

1053
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:11,455
And what do I get
if I give you the address?

1054
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,323
What about what you don't get?

1055
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:16,293
Like your freedom and all
the drugs and cash I find here.

1056
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,795
(speaking foreign language)

1057
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:23,534
Give me an address!

1058
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,504
3708.

1059
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,111
31st Street.

1060
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:37,214
Under the L train .

1061
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:40,284
31st Street under the L.
Let's go.

1062
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,521
(tapping)

1063
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,569
Did you think I was gonna
not find you?

1064
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:02,539
I've been looking for you
all night.

1065
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:04,875
No, no, no.
We have to talk.

1066
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:08,345
-You done in there?
-Yeah, we're all good.

1067
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,413
All right, shut it down.

1068
00:59:09,446 --> 00:59:10,848
I got an address
for Marisol. Let's go.

1069
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:19,056
You gonna...
You gonna unlock this?

1070
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:21,325
You're not gonna make me
break it down, are you?

1071
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:26,697
Come on, honey.
I just want to talk to you.

1072
00:59:26,731 --> 00:59:28,565
Marisol: Haven't you
done enough?

1073
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:31,802
No, not yet.

1074
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:33,938
(car engine revs)

1075
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:41,879
Don't you want to play
with me a little more?

1076
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,985
Listen. I want to talk
to you seriously, okay?

1077
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:49,519
(door crashing)

1078
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:50,955
(yelps)

1079
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:58,028
It's okay. It's okay.

1080
00:59:58,062 --> 00:59:59,596
Sit down.

1081
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:04,168
Okay, we're just gonna talk
for a little bit.

1082
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:05,369
All right?

1083
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:09,273
Here. There you go.

1084
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,277
Yeah.

1085
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,081
Oh, come on.

1086
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:19,583
I just want to tell you that

1087
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,887
what I did to you
before tonight...

1088
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,689
I'm not sorry for that...

1089
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,457
...because when I was inside you

1090
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:29,359
I was giving you love.

1091
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:33,163
You probably don't even
understand that, you know?

1092
01:00:33,197 --> 01:00:34,198
You don't even get it,

1093
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:35,800
but that's what I was doing.

1094
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:41,271
That's why I'm here.

1095
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,810
Do you know that's why I'm here?

1096
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:47,678
I'm here to help you.

1097
01:00:49,113 --> 01:00:50,447
This life you're in.

1098
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,884
This shit...
This shit we're in.

1099
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:58,655
Turning tricks for Hector

1100
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:00,324
or whatever the fuck
you're doing.

1101
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:01,491
I got nowhere to go.

1102
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:03,728
That's what I'm saying to you.

1103
01:01:04,862 --> 01:01:07,097
You got no place to go.

1104
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:12,502
I mean, who's gonna
get you out of this life?

1105
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:14,138
I don't have a choice.

1106
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:19,209
You don't have a choice?

1107
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,349
What if I told you...

1108
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:31,421
...you had a choice.
A great choice?

1109
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:39,296
You see, they don't know you
like I know you.

1110
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,567
Those cops don't know you
like I know you.

1111
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,569
I'm not going to the cops.

1112
01:01:45,602 --> 01:01:47,738
I know. I know.

1113
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,742
You're going somewhere else.

1114
01:01:53,844 --> 01:01:57,982
You're going somewhere beautiful
just like you.

1115
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,786
You don't have to do this, man,
please.

1116
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:05,055
-(sobbing)
-You don't have to thank me.

1117
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:07,324
You don't have to do this.
(sobbing)

1118
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:08,793
I want to do it.

1119
01:02:09,593 --> 01:02:11,128
I want to do it.

1120
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:17,634
I'm asking please, God.

1121
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:18,936
Anything, please.

1122
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:22,606
Don't beg. Don't beg. Don't beg!

1123
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:24,008
(sobbing)

1124
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:31,115
Just go with it.

1125
01:02:31,148 --> 01:02:32,216
Please.

1126
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:34,718
Let me take you there

1127
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,454
and you'll never have to worry
about this life again.

1128
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,393
That's why I'm here.

1129
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:55,272
Come here. Come here.
It's okay.

1130
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:56,974
Oh, God.
(sobbing)

1131
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:13,723
I'm here to help you.

1132
01:03:13,757 --> 01:03:16,193
You don't have to do this,
please.

1133
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:23,400
I hate you, motherfucker,
rot in hell.

1134
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:24,534
(laughing)

1135
01:03:26,603 --> 01:03:28,705
You're gonna burn
from the inside out.

1136
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:30,807
I'm already there, honey.

1137
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:31,976
I'm already there.
(thud)

1138
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:33,310
Police, don't move!

1139
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:35,545
Whoa, whoa.

1140
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:36,546
Drop it!

1141
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:39,049
You gonna take me out
from here?

1142
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:39,716
Please.

1143
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:40,951
Put it down.

1144
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:42,586
-There's no where to go.
-Fuck this motherfucker.

1145
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:43,753
Light them both up.

1146
01:03:43,787 --> 01:03:45,189
Okay, okay.

1147
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:52,462
I'll cuff him.

1148
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:53,597
Come here, sweetheart.

1149
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:55,632
(screaming)

1150
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,034
No!

1151
01:03:57,902 --> 01:03:59,403
Get your hands flat, flat.

1152
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:01,705
Hang on. Hang on.
You're gonna be okay, just wait.

1153
01:04:01,738 --> 01:04:02,907
Crime Sergeant to central,
I need a bus.

1154
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:07,344
Heavy bleeding,
3708 31st Street, priority.

1155
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:08,612
Hold on. Hold on.

1156
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:10,180
Officer (over radio): All right, 
 ten minutes,Crime Sergeant,

1157
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:12,249
- for that location. 
-You're gonna be okay.

1158
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:13,850
Radio: I'm going to have 
 emergency service

1159
01:04:13,884 --> 01:04:15,485
and the EMS respond.

1160
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,504
You piece of shit.

1161
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:38,342
What is that?

1162
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:43,380
It's Delgado.

1163
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,028
Give him to me.
I'm gonna take him in.

1164
01:04:58,062 --> 01:05:00,530
Why don't you just fucking
call the kids.

1165
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:01,531
Get your fucking head on.

1166
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,233
I'm taking him in!

1167
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:22,219
Hey, cop.

1168
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,989
Cop.

1169
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:28,325
Come on, man.
I'm talking to you.

1170
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:34,931
What are you, Irish?

1171
01:05:34,965 --> 01:05:37,067
Is that what I smell on you?

1172
01:05:39,303 --> 01:05:42,639
I was born here too, man.
You know that?

1173
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:45,409
I was born here.
I know my rights.

1174
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:49,713
My boy, Vargas, he's got
these great Jew lawyers.

1175
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:53,950
Wherever you're going,
it's a dark place, man.

1176
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:55,552
You're crossing
into a dark place

1177
01:05:55,585 --> 01:05:57,321
and you can't come back, man.

1178
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:02,226
And you're gonna end up like
your dead cop friends,

1179
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:05,229
rotting and stinking, man.

1180
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,198
You been pretending
your whole fucking life, man.

1181
01:06:08,232 --> 01:06:12,936
And now you're gonna
live for real, like me.

1182
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,771
(laughing)
I've been doing this

1183
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,140
my whole life, man.

1184
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:18,142
You a fucking rookie.

1185
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:22,646
And the best part is
I get to be here to see it.

1186
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:24,148
(horn honking)

1187
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:27,017
What do you think of that?

1188
01:06:33,423 --> 01:06:34,391
(door slams)

1189
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:43,333
Jesus.

1190
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:46,603
(slapping)

1191
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:53,777
Look at you.

1192
01:06:57,581 --> 01:07:00,117
Feels good to make
your own rules, don't it?

1193
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:03,453
Right?

1194
01:07:04,421 --> 01:07:06,756
We're not like other people,
me and you.

1195
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:10,394
I'm not like you.

1196
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:14,331
Okay.

1197
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:17,101
Take me to jail then.

1198
01:07:20,237 --> 01:07:20,504
No.

1199
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:23,807
You want to send me to hell,
don't you?

1200
01:07:25,242 --> 01:07:29,446
Well, you pull that trigger
and we're going together.

1201
01:07:33,417 --> 01:07:37,087
Every night
when you close your eyes

1202
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:39,223
you're gonna see me
in your dreams.

1203
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:44,261
(laughing)

1204
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:47,831
(gunshot)

1205
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,646
(phone ringing)

1206
01:08:10,053 --> 01:08:11,188
What?

1207
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:12,689
Hector: Chief?

1208
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,292
How did you get this number?

1209
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:16,926
Hector: I know my ways.

1210
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,595
Look, you want Vargas?

1211
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:19,763
You know I do.

1212
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:22,466
I can deliver him on a platter.

1213
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,735
Cavanaugh: What's it gonna 
 cost me?

1214
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:26,870
Nothing, chief.

1215
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:29,273
You'd be eliminating
my competition.

1216
01:08:29,306 --> 01:08:31,775
All right, 45 138th Street.

1217
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:32,942
Hey, Chief?

1218
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:34,244
How come everybody on the street

1219
01:08:34,278 --> 01:08:38,415
knew Jablonsky was Vargas' boy
except you?

1220
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:39,549
Hello?

1221
01:08:40,384 --> 01:08:42,852
(laughing)
Stupid son of a bitch.

1222
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:50,460
(speaking foreign language)

1223
01:08:58,702 --> 01:08:59,836
(brakes screeching)

1224
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:09,513
(gunshots)

1225
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:14,218
(shells dropping)

1226
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:19,923
Tito!
(screaming)

1227
01:09:21,725 --> 01:09:22,926
What the hell?

1228
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:24,294
(speaking foreign language)

1229
01:09:24,328 --> 01:09:25,995
(crying and screaming)

1230
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:29,599
Tito! Tito!

1231
01:09:34,704 --> 01:09:36,473
(gunshots)

1232
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:49,553
Tito!
(crying)

1233
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,396
Officer (over radio):
 Units in the 119, 138 B-Way.

1234
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:01,898
We have confirmed shots fired.

1235
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:07,637
On your knees.

1236
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:09,873
On your knees!

1237
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:15,379
Well, come on, big man.

1238
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:16,846
What are you waiting for?

1239
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:20,517
(gunshot)

1240
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,454
Not bad, huh?

1241
01:10:24,488 --> 01:10:27,491
Not bad at all, thanks.

1242
01:10:27,524 --> 01:10:28,658
(gunshot)

1243
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,732
All right, all right.

1244
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:37,934
All right, all right.

1245
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:44,874
Sorry, guys.
Last man out wins.

1246
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:49,145
Officer (over radio): Unit 119, 
 unit 119. 138 Broadway.

1247
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:50,680
We got numerous shots fired.

1248
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:52,616
Numerous shots fired, 
 that's confirmed.

1249
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:55,184
Units, numerous shots 
 fired in the 119.

1250
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:57,287
Please, units arrive alive.

1251
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:03,560
Police, don't move.

1252
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:07,897
(gunshot)

1253
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:20,677
(sirens wailing)
(phone ringing)

1254
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:26,249
Hello.

1255
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,151
Lisa: TC? You got a minute?

1256
01:11:28,184 --> 01:11:29,319
Yeah, are you alone?

1257
01:11:29,353 --> 01:11:31,621
No, it's perfect timing.

1258
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:33,890
Everybody is dead.

1259
01:11:34,558 --> 01:11:37,126
You are so full of shit!

1260
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,395
Everybody else is dead.

1261
01:11:38,428 --> 01:11:41,331
Okay, can you speak to me 
 for a second

1262
01:11:41,365 --> 01:11:42,866
without any of the jokes 
 and the bullshit

1263
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:44,501
and the showing off 
 and whatever?

1264
01:11:44,534 --> 01:11:45,769
I mean, 
 I would think you weren't alone

1265
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,303
because, obviously, 
 you don't come up

1266
01:11:47,337 --> 01:11:50,173
with the stand up routine 
 for everybody.

1267
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:51,908
Can you talk real to me?

1268
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:53,743
I mean, I know you say no...

1269
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,441
Thank you.

1270
01:12:25,409 --> 01:12:27,043
Thank you for being here.

1271
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:30,680
Thank you for everything.

1272
01:12:37,454 --> 01:12:39,523
(music continues)

1273
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:13,857
Carmine: St. Francis of Assisi.

1274
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,027
It belongs here.

1275
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:21,865
It belongs with her.

1276
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:26,436
You're a good cop, Carmine.

1277
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:29,739
Too bad you had
to go over to the dark side.

1278
01:13:29,773 --> 01:13:31,174
The dark side?

1279
01:13:33,677 --> 01:13:35,779
That's kind of funny
coming from you.

1280
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:42,018
I did what I had to do
to get the job done.

1281
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:46,122
I don't make a living
hunting other cops.

1282
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:47,457
Well...

1283
01:13:47,491 --> 01:13:49,192
Come on, bent cops.

1284
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:52,328
I remove the bad apples
from the barrel.

1285
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:53,763
You know,
somebody's got to do that.

1286
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:55,799
The whole barrel can go bad.

1287
01:13:55,832 --> 01:13:58,034
Is this about
your investigation?

1288
01:13:58,067 --> 01:13:59,002
Is that why you're here?

1289
01:13:59,035 --> 01:14:00,504
You gonna put the cuffs
on me personally,

1290
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:02,038
or is that their job?

1291
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:03,673
What investigation?

1292
01:14:03,707 --> 01:14:05,742
My case is closed.
Everybody's dead.

1293
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:10,346
The press is very happy
with Jablonsky in his grave.

1294
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:12,315
Stan Jablonsky
would crawl through

1295
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:15,118
broken glass
to save another cops ass.

1296
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:16,986
He was a cop's cop.

1297
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:21,124
I didn't see this coming.

1298
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:22,058
No?

1299
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:25,995
Maybe I didn't want
to see it coming.

1300
01:14:26,029 --> 01:14:29,533
So you would have dropped
a dime on him, if you did?

1301
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:33,136
I don't know.

1302
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:42,712
I'm just looking for a reason
to give a shit again.

1303
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:48,251
Oh, you're looking?

1304
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,054
That's good...

1305
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:55,625
...because we only ask
for one thing, you know?

1306
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:59,095
You gave your word.

1307
01:14:59,763 --> 01:15:01,931
You raised your hand.

1308
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:09,005
You swore to protect people...

1309
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,076
...and that's it.

1310
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:16,045
Too darn simple.

1311
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:23,787
Keep looking.

1312
01:15:35,298 --> 01:15:38,101
(dramatic music)
