1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:04,038
And now,
a Paramount Plus made-for-TV movie.

2
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:08,109
"It's not a movie...
it's a made-for-TV movie."

4
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:13,281
From the green hills of Vermont

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,449
to the verdant canyons
of Arizona,

6
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,519
people all over the country
are beginning to realize

7
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:20,388
it's nearly over!

8
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:24,558
We have almost beaten COVID
and the best news of all:

9
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:29,497
Infections are
at an all-time low.

10
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:32,233
New, stronger vaccinations
have ebbed the tide.

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,468
And we humans
are cleaning up the mess

12
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,904
and finally
getting on with our lives.

13
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:40,207
But as we start to get back
to our jobs and schools,

14
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,009
one question remains:

15
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:45,813
What lingering effects will
the pandemic have on children?

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,517
Some say no effect at all.
The children are just fine.

17
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,185
We came together

18
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:52,687
and finally we can say,
we are starting to

19
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,755
- win the war against COVID.
- Stan?

20
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,757
Stan, the phone's for you!

21
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,392
Stan!

22
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:00,861
What?!

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,897
Could you not hear me?

24
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:05,199
Yeah, dude,
but I'm busy working.

25
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,034
Working on getting drunk again.

26
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:08,569
I'm not "getting drunk,"

27
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,604
I'm an online
whiskey consultant.

28
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:11,939
I'm doing research.

29
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:14,008
Everyone needs
to leave me alone.

30
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,043
The guy on the phone
said it's important.

31
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,246
He said his name
is Kyle Broflovski.

32
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:21,615
Kyle?

33
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,253
- Hello?
- Oh, hi.

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,924
Is this Stan Marsh,
from South Park?

35
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:32,593
- Kyle?
- Oh, dude, it is you!

36
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,762
How have you...
How have you been?

37
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,365
I'm... fine. How are you?

38
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,799
I'm good, I'm...

39
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,235
I know this is weird.
We haven't talked since...

40
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,270
well, you know,
since it all happened.

41
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:46,974
Yeah, well, the pandemic
is about over now.

42
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,476
I'm moving on with my life.

43
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,978
Stan...
you should come back here.

44
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:53,114
There's a lot going on.

45
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,750
There's nothing in
South Park for me, Kyle!

46
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,752
I'm not going back there, ever.

47
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,154
Look, dude, you remember
when we were little?

48
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,256
When the pandemic...
first started.

49
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,991
Us friends said
we'd always be there

50
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,326
for each other
when things got bad.

51
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:07,795
What do you mean?
What's happened?

52
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:09,163
Stan...

53
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,333
It's Kenny. He's dead.

54
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,921
Live from the Moderna Center

55
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,356
in downtown New York,

56
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:37,391
it's Late Night With Jimmy!

57
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:41,796
Tonight's guest,
First Lady Tom Kardashian!

58
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:46,534
And now here he is,
the king of woke comedy, Jimmy!

59
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,004
Wow.

60
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:52,206
Wow, what a terrific audience.

61
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,542
What a fantastic audience, wow.

62
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,546
Geez, what's the deal
with these Mexicans, huh?

63
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,682
I mean, they have fabulous food,

64
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,484
their country
has amazing beaches,

65
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:06,787
and they're
really fantastic people.

66
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,191
Wow, what a great audience.

67
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:12,493
You know,
today I was on the subway

68
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,795
and I saw an ad
for the Center for People

69
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:18,232
Who Identify as Homosexual
But Were Born Bi.

70
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:19,834
Have you seen this?

71
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,068
Have you heard about this?

72
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,636
I'll tell you one thing...

73
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,205
those people are brave
and deserve

74
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,974
every ounce of our respect.

75
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,409
S-Stick around.

76
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,244
First Lady Tom Kardashian
is here.

77
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,346
We'll be right back!

78
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,249
Jimmy, we got
a call from corporate.

79
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:36,717
They want you to cut
the hummus joke.

80
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:37,918
What?!

81
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,687
It's hard enough
doing comedy these days.

82
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,422
Now I'm getting notes
during commercial breaks?!

83
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,557
You're just gonna have to joke
about something else.

84
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,593
All right, fine, what else
is going on in the news? Quick!

85
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,896
Uh, Amazon thinks they might
have discovered gold on Mars.

86
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:50,598
Ah, Jesus. Anything else?

87
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,933
Uh, that famous
eccentric scientist died.

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,003
The millionaire philanthropist?
Dr. McCormick?

89
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,207
Kenny? Kenny's dead?

90
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:01,909
Oh, I'm sorry,
did you know him?

91
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:04,278
We were friends when we
were kids. Let me see that!

92
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,580
"Very
mysterious circumstances."

93
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,849
That's what doctors
are saying about

94
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,284
the death of beloved scientist

95
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,953
and humanitarian,
Dr. Kenny McCormick.

96
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,856
McCormick was a pioneer of
science and technology

97
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,959
who was always trying to unlock
the key to a better future.

98
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:22,296
He worked tirelessly...
some say balls-out crazily...

99
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,131
on new inventions and theories

100
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:27,268
but somehow his biggest
questions seemed to elude him.

101
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,436
The head of NASA said,
"We have lost

102
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,272
"an innovator and a visionary.

103
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,574
"Kenny was so brilliant
that most of the time,

104
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:36,310
we couldn't even understand
what he was saying."

105
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,380
Get me a first-class ticket
to South Park!

106
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,149
What? You can't leave!
You have to get back onstage!

107
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:43,817
The first lady is here!

108
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,653
Tell Tom Kardashian to suck my

109
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,789
P-P-Popsicles
that are in the green room,

110
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,057
and that I am very sorry,

111
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,825
and that he is
a fantastic person.

112
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,807
Stan?

113
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:09,243
Stan, wake up,
I think we're here.

114
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,588
So that's it, huh?

115
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,624
- That's the town you grew up in?
- Yeah.

116
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:27,261
Well, how does it feel to
be back after all these years?

117
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,764
It feels shitty, okay?
Can you please shut the fuck up?

118
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,300
Why did you even bring me
along if you're not going

119
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,868
to let me help you
through this?!

120
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,303

Denny's is now
Denny's Applebee's Max.

141
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,514
Come taste the difference.

142
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,534
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, dude.

143
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,237
Wow. This is crazy, huh?

144
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,473
I mean, how long has it been?

145
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,309
I guess...
since we were nine.

146
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,977
Well, have a seat.

147
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,480
What have you been up to?

148
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,981
Oh, dude,
just all kinds of stuff.

149
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,583
You know, getting stuff going.

150
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,252
Got my own online
whiskey consultant gig.

151
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,787
I'm totally happy.
What about you?

152
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,656
Oh, I'm getting things
going, too.

153
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:38,992
I'm doing a sort of counseling
online start-up thing.

154
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,394
Really doing great, too.

155
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:42,896
- Sweet.
- Listen, Stan...

156
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,500
I know that we disagreed
a lot during the pandemic,

157
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,168
but I hope we can
put that aside...

158
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,804
Dude, Kyle,
I'm just here for Kenny.

159
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,406
All right, well,

160
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:55,008
there's something you should
know about the way Kenny died.

161
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,644
Hi, guys, welcome to
Denny's Applebee's Max.

162
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,480
I see you
got your menus already.

163
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:00,748
As you're deciding
what to order,

164
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,082
I just want to go over
a couple things.

165
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,517
Now, of course, it is the future

166
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,486
so we don't have any meat
on the menu.

167
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,187
'Cause you know,
here in the future,

168
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,423
we've all decided meat is wrong.

169
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,758
Yeah, we know.

170
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,593
Okay, and, uh,
you'll see there's

171
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,795
some dishes made
from insect protein on the menu.

172
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,997
That, of course, is because
here in the future,

173
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,866
we've all learned that insects
are a valuable and sustainable

174
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:22,202
food and we no longer
fear it as a food. Mm-hmm.

175
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,837
We know, dude.

176
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,039
Okay, well, if you have any
questions, please don't hesitate

177
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,876
to say anything, because,
you know, it's the future.

178
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:32,045
We've learned to all just
get along and love each other.

179
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,783
Look, Stan,
Kenny was trying to find

180
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,018
the answers
to some pretty heavy stuff.

181
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,687
He felt like there
were people responsible

182
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,289
for everything that's happened.

183
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,991
Like who?

184
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:47,628
That's just it. Nobody knows.
But whoever these people are,

185
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,230
they didn't want
Kenny McCormick exposing them.

186
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,399
Wait a minute. Token?

187
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,067
Yeah, it's me.

188
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,537
Just before he died,
Kenny was texting me

189
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,372
that he was on
to something huge.

190
00:08:58,439 --> 00:08:59,973
And he was texting me, too.

191
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,575
Saying he'd discovered
something that

192
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:02,876
could change the world.

193
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,211
And then he died,

194
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,813
and the hospital won't say how.

195
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,648
And that got us thinking...

196
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,951
Oh, my God.
They killed Kenny.

197
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:14,721
I'm just here for the funeral.

198
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,424
I don't want to be a part
of anything else.

199
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,759
Dude, there might be
people to blame

200
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,861
for ruining our childhoods.

201
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,663
So what do you wanna do, Kyle?

202
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,666
Go on some bullshit adventure
like when we were kids?

203
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,001
Maybe, maybe we can call
Jesus and Santa

204
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,104
and ask them for help.
Is that what you want?

205
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,675
It's the fucking future,
you guys. Grow up.

206
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:43,917
Hello, welcome to
the Super 12 Motel Plus.

207
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,286
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, Stan Marsh.

208
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,088
I have a room for one night.

209
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:52,726
Okay, I see you're in one of
our Mach Ten Super Plus rooms.

210
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:55,128
Now, of course,
we only take Bitcoin

211
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,630
and other cryptocurrency 'cause,

212
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,131
you know, it's the future.

213
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,133
We've all decided
centralized banking is rigged,

214
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,036
so we trust more in
fly-by-night Ponzi schemes.

215
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,605
Yeah, I know.

216
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,877
So you walked out on
all your friends and then

217
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,745
just hung out at a bar all day?

218
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:15,382
Alexa, fucking just go
throw yourself out a window.

219
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,718
I'm sorry.
I didn't quite get that.

220
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,988
Nothing.
Alexa, turn on the TV.

221
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:24,424
Oh, God, you are
such a piece of shit.

222
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,826
You know,

223
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,661
if you had
Remote Prime membership,

224
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,663
you could watch Amazon movies
wherever you go.

225
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,231
Would you like to get started?

226
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,966
- No.
- I'm sorry.

227
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,168
I'm trying
to be fucking helpful.

228
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,671
Why don't you grow up
and start acting like an adult

229
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,172
for once in your life...

230
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,340
Alexa, stop!

231
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,608
Fuck you!

232
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:48,181
Jon, I'm standing outside
the South Park Flash Rail Max,

233
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,017
where hundreds of people
are coming to

234
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,020
pay their respects
to Dr. Kenny McCormick.

235
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,656
There's still no word
from the hospital

236
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,858
on what exactly
killed Kenny McCormick,

237
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:00,193
but letters sent to multiple
news outlets reveal

238
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,996
that he might have
known his life was in danger.

239
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:07,200
Dr. McCormick said,
"I am about to expose the truth.

240
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,670
"In the event of my death
I have hidden away

241
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,271
"all relevant information.

242
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,274
My closest friends
will know where to find it."

243
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,943
Dr. Kenneth McCormick.

244
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,812
He wanted to make the future
a better place.

245
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,783
Too bad he died, 'cause
the future certainly sucks.

246
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,897
♪ Someone's at the door ♪

247
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,899

249
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,571
Yeah, I know.

250
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,341
Okay, so you were right.

251
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,875
Kenny was on to some bad people

252
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,911
and he hid something
for us to find.

253
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:52,746
Yeah, I saw.
Only problem is

254
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,214
I don't know
what he's talking about.

255
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,183
But thank you
for saying I was right.

256
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,085
You're welcome. It doesn't mean
that you were right

257
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,486
about everything
during the pandemic.

258
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,487
Because you weren't.

259
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,055
Okay, well, obviously

260
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,991
we're never going to agree
on certain things,

261
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,592
so we shouldn't talk about them.

262
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,362
Sounds good.
So let's go to Kenny's wake

263
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,896
and see if anyone else shows up

264
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,665
who might know what
Kenny's talking about.

265
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,567
Let's do that.

266
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,044
Hello. Testing.
Hey, everybody.

267
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:26,580
It's amazing to see you all
here for Kenny's wake.

268
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,282
Wow, what a great audience.

269
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,884
Uh, for those of you
who don't know,

270
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,386
my name is Jimmy Valmer and, uh,

271
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,288
I had to take an Asian airline
to get here today.

272
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,124
You know what they say
about Asian airlines...

273
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,792
they're dependable
and just as efficient

274
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,627
as any other competent airline.

275
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,098
What a terrific audience.

276
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,200
So many people
have come for Kenny today...

277
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,303
so many amazing friends
I haven't seen in ages.

278
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,240
You know, I had a friend once
who was a Polish hair stylist.

279
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,243
Talk about an amazing haircut
at an affordable price.

280
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,380
Well, I know that
we're all ready

281
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,315
to talk to each other
and share our memories of Kenny.

282
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,217
So please just have fun
and we'll see you

283
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,620
at the funeral tomorrow.

- Stan Marsh?
- Yeah?

289
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,236
Hi. It's Wendy.

290
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,505
Wendy Testaburger, wow.

291
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,607
Yeah. My husband, Darwin.

292
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,276
Hey, pal, how are ya?

293
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,478
Hey, guys.
It's Tweek and Craig.

294
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,246
Oh, hey.
How are you guys?

295
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,481
We're good.

296
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:35,949
I have a lot of anxiety

297
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,284
being back
with all these people!

298
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,152
Wendy's told me a lot
about you, Stan.

299
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,421
How's everything
with the family?

300
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,958
Excuse me, I'm gonna go
get, uh, drunk.

301
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,294
- What's wrong with Stan?
- We're just...

302
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,029
trying to find out
what happened to Kenny.

303
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:52,099
I think this goes deeper
than you guys realize.

304
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,536
Hey, Stan Marsh!
Good to see you.

305
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,638
It's me, Clyde Donovan.

306
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,006
Oh, hey, Clyde.

307
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,342
What have you been doing
during the pandemic?

308
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:03,944
Oh, you know, lots of stuff.

309
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,980
Yeah, me, too.
Sucks about Kenny, huh?

310
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,148
Hope they find
all the information

311
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,117
- on that thing he hid.
- You know

312
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,685
where he might have hid it?

313
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:15,222
No, I don't.
But I bet someone here does.

314
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,457
It's really great
to see you guys again.

315
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,060
These past few decades
have been really tough.

316
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:23,330
Yeah, sometimes I think
the pandemic really aged me.

317
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,966
Kyle, can I talk to you
for a second?

318
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,770
- Dude, he's here.
- Who's here?

319
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:33,740
- Cartman?
- Yeah, but he's changed.

320
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,142
Changed how?

321
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,010
Yes, I know,
it's been a long time

322
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,311
since we've seen each other.

323
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,679
I'm doing really well.

324
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,648
I'm actually the head
of Gespetzah Synagogue

325
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:42,916
down in Colorado Springs.

326
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:45,018
Can you believe it?
I'm a rabbi.

327
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:48,555
Yeah, you know, when
the whole pandemic happened,

328
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:49,856
I think it changed me.

329
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,892
It really changed me
for the better.

330
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,326
- It did?
- No.

331
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,029
- He's fucking with me.
- What? Oh, yeah.

332
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,732
Yeah, I get it,
the Eric Cartman you guys knew

333
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,600
didn't seem like
he'd become a rabbi.

334
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,736
But I found real meaning
in the Torah

335
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:04,838
and then I found a great
Jewish woman and...

336
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,841
let the spirit of the Talmud
guide our lives.

337
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,509
Okay, jut knock it off, fat-ass.

338
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,777
Dude.

339
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,379
Wow, that's very big
of you, Kyle.

340
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,382
Still living in South Park
and calling people fat-ass, huh?

341
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,684
Wait, I'm sorry,
that was uncalled for.

342
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,352
It's not fucking funny, Cartman!

343
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,955
Stop pretending you
have a happy Jewish life!

344
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,590
Hey, shoogina!
I'm sorry, I couldn't

345
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:26,459
wait in the car anymore;
I had to meet your friends.

346
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,529
Oh, that's okay.
Guys, this is my wife, Yentl.

347
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,232
I've heard so many stories
about you all.

348
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,100
It must have been amazing
to grow up

349
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,969
in these beautiful mountains!

350
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,538
Yentl? Her name is Yentl?

351
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,942
Can we fucking stop this
and talk about Kenny, please?!

352
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:45,979
- Oh, is that, uh...?
- Yeah, that's-that's Kyle, yeah.

353
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,048
I'm sorry, honey, can you
just give me a couple minutes?

354
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,950
I just need a few more
seconds with them

355
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,084
and I'll be right out
to the car.

356
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,586
Oh, okay, I get it.

357
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:53,954
Nice to meet you guys.

358
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,922
We'll see you at the funeral,
I guess.

359
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,958
And I'm very sorry
for your loss.

360
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,660
Bye, Mrs. Cartman.

361
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:04,598
Okay, look, guys, Kenny and I
were still really good friends.

362
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,667
He used to email me all the time
about stuff he was doing.

363
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:08,969
Yeah, me, too!

364
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,737
Well, so then maybe he also

365
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,672
told you that
he was trying to find

366
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,507
the origin of the coronavirus.

367
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,276
What are you talking about?

368
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:19,412
Kenny was obsessed with
how corona first got started.

369
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,016
He was clearly on to something,
and then he died.

370
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,452
I know we all want
to solve this for him.

371
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,520
You know, in the Torah,
when Abraham

372
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:28,855
first heard the word of God...

373
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,523
Just knock it off!
You don't believe

374
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,092
a word of that shit.
You're just doing all this

375
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,526
to get a rise out of me.

376
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:34,794
Kyle, you really think

377
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,196
I would spend 40 years
of my life

378
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:37,864
just to get a rise out of you?

379
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,634
- Yes, I do!
- Same ol' Kyle.

380
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,035
Well, I got to go, guys.

381
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,237
I'll see you at Kenny's funeral
tomorrow.

382
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,208
Maybe he's really changed.

383
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:52,045
No. He is fucking with me.

384
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,358
Sometimes I feel like

385
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,727
things weren't supposed
to be like this.

386
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,864
Like maybe there are others
in control of the way

387
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,399
it all turned out.

388
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,567
Is that what you're saying,
Dr. McCormick?

389
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:18,305
Are you saying that there are
other people responsible?

390
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,675
I guess what I'm trying to say,
Dr. McCormick, is...

391
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:25,512
your theories seem to point to
some kind of people with power.

392
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:29,683
Let me put it another way...
we've all seen the pictures

393
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,152
of you working in Egypt,
lecturing at MIT.

394
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,688
And you always seem to
come back to this concept

395
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,924
of this mysterious
organization who is to blame.

396
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:40,026
- Let me put it yet another way, Dr. McCormick.
- Hang on a second.

397
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,996
What was that?
Alexa, freeze the video.

398
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,531
- What?
- Freeze video

399
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,000
and reverse playback
ten seconds.

400
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,004
Stop there.

401
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,909
Enhance image 20%.

402
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:57,444
Ugh. Whatever.

403
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,449
Shift right ten frames.

404
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:05,618
Enhance.

405
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,289
Tegridy Weed?

406
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,859
Isn't that your dad's
old marijuana company?

407
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:16,296
Oh, shit.

408
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,608
Hi. Welcome.
Welcome, my friends.

409
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,276
So blessed to have you here.

410
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,645
Hello, my child,
thank you for coming.

411
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,647
- Yeah, sure.
- Wait, Stan?

412
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,216
Stan Marsh?

413
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,885
Praise be!
I haven't seen you in ages!

414
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,587
I'm sorry, do I know you?

415
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:41,988
Well, sure, it's me!

416
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,391
Scott Malkinson!
Remember me?

417
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,494
- Uh, no, sorry.
- I hung out with you guys

418
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,329
all the time
when we were little.

419
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,164
I was the kid with the lisp.

420
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:54,167
- Who had diabetes?
- Oh, yeah, sure...

421
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,736
Great to see you again.

422
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,272
Hey, guys.
Great to see you in church.

423
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,441
- It's Scott Malkinson.
- Who?

424
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,910
Scott Malkinson, I went
to school with you guys?

425
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,311
Oh, okay.

426
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:09,282
Hello. Welcome. Hey!
It's me! Scott Malkinson!

427
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:12,018
With the diabetes. No?

428
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:17,157
Kenny McCormick was
a cherished son, a wise man,

429
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,691
and a wonderful friend.

430
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,693
Kenny touched all
of our lives and made

431
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,764
each and every one of us
laugh, cry and ponder.

432
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,266
And in his death,

433
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,035
now we can reflect on
our own lives.

434
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:31,438
Are we happy?

435
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,774
Are we the person
we hoped to be?

436
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,378
Have we, like Kenny,
given all that we can

437
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,613
to forgive those around us?

438
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,282
For life is short,

439
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,351
and our family and friends
must be cherished.

440
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:48,855
You know, in many ways,
death is like diabetes.

441
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,691
You spend your whole life
trying to fight it off

442
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,461
but ultimately it just wins.

443
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,131
And so let's take the time now
to reach out to our friends.

444
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,666
To reach out to our family.

445
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,302
To tell our mothers
and our fathers that we...

446
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,305
All right! All right! Who
the fuck put you up to this?

447
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,474
Did you write
this goddamn speech, Kyle?

448
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,242
Did you tell him
to say all this stuff?

449
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,678
What the fuck
are you talking about?

450
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,680
You know that I know something
about Kenny

451
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,082
that I'm not telling you because
it involves my father,

452
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,650
who I don't want to face!

453
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,320
That's crazy and you'd be able
to face what happened

454
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,589
to your family if you
weren't a fucking asshole!

455
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,158
Guys, please,
this is a house of God.

456
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,593
You shut the fuck up!

457
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,762
You judge me,
you all sit here and judge me.

458
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,598
Well, fuck all of you!

459
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,434
This is exactly why I moved out
of this hick-ass town!

460
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,436
And I am going back home
to the city!

461
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:38,838
My child, please,
we are gathered in Christ...

462
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,373
My child, please,
we are gathered in Christ.

463
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,243
I'm Scott Malkinson.
I have diabetes.

464
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,714
He does remember me!

465
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,116
Alexa, start the car!

466
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:52,886
Start the car?
Where are you going?

467
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,288
I need to stop at a store
and then we're going home.

468
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,956
What about the connection
you just found

469
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,391
between Kenny and your father?

470
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,727
Alexa, find the nearest
liquor store.

471
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,295
Oh, you wanna get drunk?

472
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,297
Let me guess... someone said
something you didn't like

473
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,566
and it made you want to
pound beer and wine?

474
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:08,468
It's not
"pounding beer and wine."

475
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:10,470
I drop wine shots into the beer.

476
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,739
It's called a "smorgasvein"
and it's very cultural!

477
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:15,708
Stop acting like a child and
support your dead friend, Stan!

478
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,645
- You don't even have any...
- Alexa, stop!

479
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,452
Thank you.
Thank you, Father.

480
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,888
Hello, everyone.
My name is Rabbi Cartman

481
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:32,559
and I was Kenny McCormick's
very, very best friend.

482
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,829
Kenny was not a Jew,
but he had so many

483
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,565
amazing Jewish qualities.

484
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,733
Qualities that I see
in my loving wife

485
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,404
and my amazing kids,
that are right over there.

486
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,172
Over there by Kyle.

487
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,508
And as we all return now
to our homes

488
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:51,344
and our lives, I think that...
a lot like Abraham...

489
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:54,013
- let's not forget that...
- Excuse me. Everyone?

490
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,481
Hello?

491
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,584
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

492
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,354
We got results from the PNR scan
of Dr. McCormick's remains

493
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,623
and we now know
the cause of his death.

494
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,093
Now we all need to stay calm.

495
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,029
There is no reason
to panic, but...

496
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,432
Kenny died of COVID.

497
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,800
It's a new variant.

498
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:18,371
The COVID Delta Plus
Rewards Program variant.

499
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:22,642
Everyone, please!

500
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,310
We cannot panic!

501
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,663
That's it! We're all out
of chin diapers!

502
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,399
Oh, God, we're all out
of chin diapers!

503
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,004
Zoom...

504
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,140
Come on, come on, come on!
Remote learning!

505
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,175
Come on, come on, come on!

506
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,417
Alexa, what's going on?

507
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:07,320
There's some kind
of road closure ahead.

508
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,330
Set up a perimeter!
I want all exit points sealed.

509
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,670
People of South Park,

510
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,606
there is an outbreak of COVID
in your community.

511
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,441
You are being quarantined.

512
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:32,612
Hey, dude! I don't live here.
I need to get home!

513
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:35,448
Nobody is going in or out.

514
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:38,618
We have confirmation that
one person in this community

515
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:41,120
has never been vaccinated
against COVID,

516
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:43,456
so we must quarantine everyone.

517
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:46,192
One person?!
Well, who is it?!

518
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,461
We are not allowed to say.

519
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:50,630
But if you tell us who
the unvaccinated person is,

520
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:53,132
we can have them vaccinated
and then this will all be over!

521
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:56,736
We can't tell you who it is
because, in case you forgot,

522
00:23:56,803 --> 00:24:00,306
it's the future, and we don't
single out or ridicule anyone

523
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:02,308
for their personal beliefs.

524
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,577
Gah! I hate the future!

525
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:06,479
What does this mean?

526
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,481
Yeah, what's it mean, Daddy?

527
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:10,550
I think it means...

528
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,819
we're all stuck in South Park.

529
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,659
Okay, there we go.

530
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:20,827
We'll get back
with the results.

531
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,328
Maintain six feet
social distance

532
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:23,763
and stay indoors.
Thank you.

533
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,897
Next, please!

534
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,500
Yeah, listen, I have to
get out of here.

535
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:28,735
Yes, don't we all.

536
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,236
No, no, no,
I don't belong here

537
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,771
and I don't have
anywhere to stay.

538
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,606
They've shut down
all the motels.

539
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,842
Do you have any friends or
family that you can stay with?

540
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,677
No, these people
are not my friends

541
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:39,345
and I have no family here.

542
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:41,280
- Oka...
- It's okay.

543
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:42,849
They've set up
an emergency shelter

544
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,351
for all the people who were here
from out of town.

545
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:47,653
Where?

546
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,170
All right,
everyone, listen up.

547
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:05,605
No way.

548
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,707
Welcome to
South Park Elementary.

549
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:10,009
We want to help you all
be as comfortable as possible.

550
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:12,378
So we will have quiet time
from 9:00 p.m.

551
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:14,847
to 6:00 a.m. every day.
I don't want to hear

552
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:17,817
any fucking gender-specific
language in here.

553
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:20,119
And if anybody here
casts a movie with someone

554
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,522
other than the culture
that that movie is about,

555
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,157
you are fucking out of here!

556
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:28,861
All right, thank you.
It is now 9:01. Lights out.

557
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:43,576
It's been a long time
since I've prayed.

558
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,913
I don't know
if anyone can hear me...

559
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,749
but we all really
need help right now.

560
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,052
I know in my heart
that Kenny didn't just die

561
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,421
of some new COVID variant.

562
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:58,891
I know there's something
way bigger going on.

563
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:02,428
But it all seems like
so much to take on.

564
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:05,097
Please, if there's
anyone who could

565
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:09,469
help see me through this,
it would be a miracle.

566
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,855
♪ Someone's at the door ♪

567
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,390
♪ This is the doorbell ♪

568
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,226
♪ Apparently in the future ♪

569
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,761
♪ All doorbells
sing, sing, sing. ♪

570
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:39,031
Yeah, I fucking know,
goddamn it!

571
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,969
Hey, Kyle.
Oh, man, this is crazy, huh?

572
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:45,705
The school is all filled up
and the motels are shut down.

573
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,607
I was, I was just hoping
maybe we could crash here.

574
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:50,643
Look, I, uh,
I don't think that's gonna work.

575
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,979
I figured Stan is probably
staying with you, too?

576
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,313
No. No, he's not.

577
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,582
Oh, great!
Then you have some extra rooms.

578
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:59,485
- We're gonna be okay, kids!
- Yay!

579
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:00,887
No, no, Cartman,
I'm sure there are

580
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,455
some other places you can stay.

581
00:27:02,522 --> 00:27:03,956
My family would be
really comfortable

582
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:07,126
in a nice Jewish home.
Please, Kyle, for my kids.

583
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,730
We promise we'll be good,
Uncle Kyle.

584
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,331
Please, Uncle Kyle?

585
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,467
Please,
Uncle Kyle?

586
00:27:14,534 --> 00:27:15,902
I can't believe this.

587
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,837
Come on, kids!
Oh, bless you, Kyle.

588
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:19,739
Don't worry,
I'll put them right to bed.

589
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,941
You won't even know we're here.

590
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:24,176
Toda raba, Uncle Kyle.

591
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:26,512
That's Hebrew for "thank you."

592
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,957
Guys, doesn't this all
seem a little too convenient?

593
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:39,191
What do you mean?

594
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,526
I mean that Kenny's death
is suspicious,

595
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:42,662
he talks about people
to blame and then

596
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,964
he suddenly dies of
some new COVID variant?

597
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,766
You think it's a cover, Token?

598
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,935
I think it's
definitely suspicious.

599
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,704
Speaking of suspicious,
what do you call a trans woman

600
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:53,906
that walks into
an abortion clinic?

601
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,277
Her name is Rebecca
and she's a fantastic person.

602
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:01,314
Just seems all nice
and buttoned up, doesn't it?

603
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,683
It's a perfect cause of death
and anyone who's trying

604
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,451
to sort it out is quarantined

605
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,353
because one person
isn't vaccinated?

606
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,389
It's true... who wouldn't be
vaccinated by now?

607
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:11,824
I'm certainly vaccinated.

608
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,193
- Yeah, I'm vaccinated.
- Me, too.

609
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,695
We're all vaccinated.

610
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:19,732
Yeah, I mean, I-I think
it's a personal choice.

611
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,736
What does that mean?
Are you vaccinated, Clyde?

612
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,871
I'm... immunized.

613
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,540
He's not fucking vaccinated!

614
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:28,808
He's the fucking one!

615
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,076
Hey, I just, I just

616
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,178
need to see the research
first, you know.

617
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:36,749
It's been 40 years, Clyde.
That's enough research!

618
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,153
Alexa, set an alarm
for 7:00 a.m.

619
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:46,726
Alexa,
set an alarm for 7:00 a.m.

620
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,028
Why don't you go talk
to your father?

621
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:50,229
Goddamn it.

622
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,931
If there's some kind
of connection

623
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:53,699
with your dad's farm that can
help everyone figure out

624
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:56,669
what's going on,
then you need to talk to him.

625
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,537
Can I just go to sleep, please?

626
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:00,506
Oh, poor you!
Poor you!

627
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,042
Stop being a fucking victim.
At least you get to go out

628
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:05,878
and do stuff.
What do I get to do?

629
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:08,547
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
- Oh, okay, great.

630
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:10,249
You're sorry, again.

631
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:12,952
By the way, I can tell you

632
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:15,254
about some great deals
on headphones at Best Buy.

633
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:16,856
Would you like to know more?

634
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,358
- Sure, yes, tell me more.
- Okay.

635
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,761
The Mark VII headphones
have a new edition coming out.

636
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,796
Should I add that
to your shopping list?

637
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:26,098
Yes, sure,
add them to my shopping list.

638
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:28,134
Okay.
I'll add Mark VII headphones

639
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,836
from Best Buy
to your shopping list.

640
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:38,611
Oh, yeah.

641
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:41,313
Yeah, you like that?
Yeah! Yeah!

642
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,315
Yeah, you like how Abraham
trusted in the one true God?!

643
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:47,153
Yeah! Oh, oh, yeah! Yeah!

644
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,655
Goddamn it!

645
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,459
Oh. Shh, shh. Hang on, honey.

646
00:29:53,526 --> 00:29:54,960
Hang on.

647
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,563
Yeah, yeah,
what's up, buddy?

648
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,665
What's up
is that I am over this!

649
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:00,833
What are, what are
you talking about?

650
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,234
You know what I'm talking about!

651
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,570
You know I can hear you
through the walls!

652
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,172
Okay, geez, I'm sorry.

653
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,174
Sorry I was making love
to my wife.

654
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,642
No Jewish people have sex

655
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,510
screaming about
their love of Abraham!

656
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:13,512
You are a fucking fraud!

657
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:14,847
Is everything all right?

658
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:16,615
Do you know that
your husband once snuck

659
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,918
in my room
and gave me fucking AIDS?!

660
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,854
- I'm sorry?!
- Oh, my God, Kyle!

661
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:24,957
If we are being too loud, please
don't lash out at my wife!

662
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,793
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
I don't know what to say.

663
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,196
Mom, Dad, is everything okay?

664
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,298
It's all right, kids.
Go back to bed.

665
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,267
Kyle, obviously you have
a problem with us being here.

666
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,637
I promise you that we will be
gone first thing in the morning.

667
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:40,673
That's probably best!

668
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,050
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah!

669
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,551
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, you like how Abraham

670
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:53,819
- almost sacrificed his only son?!
- Oh, yeah!

671
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:54,787
Yeah!

672
00:30:58,758 --> 00:31:00,826
Sir! Sir,
the townspeople are demanding

673
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:02,628
to know when
the quarantine will end.

674
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:05,731
It'll end when we get the order
that everything is safe.

675
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:09,001
But, sir, the people inside
are running out of supplies.

676
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,469
They're saying they don't
have nearly enough

677
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,571
chin diapers and
people are starting to fight.

678
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:17,543
I have strict orders not to let
anything in or out of this town.

679
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,579
They'll just have to make do
the best they can in there.

680
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:23,983
Hopefully they can
maintain some sense of humanity.

681
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,584
We got a runner!

682
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:27,553
Another one trying to get out!

683
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,921
Please!

684
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,257
I just need to go to
a sporting event!

685
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,280
Hey, Clyde. Clyde, can we
talk to you for a second?

686
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,447
Sure, what's up?

687
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:58,551
Look, Clyde,
we all really respect

688
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,120
your personal p-p-preferences.

689
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:04,256
But we have things we
really need to get back to.

690
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:07,259
We've got jobs a-and careers,
people who need us.

691
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,261
B-But we're being forced
to stay here.

692
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:12,364
So could you maybe just...
just get vaccinated real quick?

693
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,800
Oh. Um...

694
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:17,236
Nah. I don't wanna.

695
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:21,073
Look, I'm sorry, guys.
It's for health reasons.

696
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,976
I can't get vaccinated 'cause
I'm allergic to shellfish.

697
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:27,947
Clyde, there's no shellfish
in the COVID vaccine.

698
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,982
I know,
but I read that sometimes

699
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:31,884
in the lab where the vaccine
is made,

700
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:33,752
if somebody ate shellfish,

701
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,254
then it can
get cross-contaminated

702
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:38,224
and have leftover
residual shellfish-ness.

703
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,993
So you're saying you
won't take the COVID vaccine

704
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,728
out of shellfish-ness.

705
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,163
Yes, that is correct.

706
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,799
Just a general sense
of shellfish-ness.

707
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:49,535
Everyone, you better
come check this out.

708
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,171
Look at this.

709
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:54,573
The McCormick Science Wing

710
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,742
at South Park Elementary.

711
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,811
Yeah, so? I read about this.

712
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:00,112
Kenny donated tons of money

713
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:01,847
to build a science center
for the students.

714
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:03,315
Yeah, for the students.

715
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:05,351
So why does it
have a lock on it?

716
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:20,165
This must be where Kenny
was doing all his research.

717
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:23,769
He didn't want to be found,
so he used the school as cover.

718
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:27,907
Uh, guys, why is there
blood everywhere?

719
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,776
Everybody see what you can find.

720
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,879
There's got to be a clue here
of who killed Kenny.

I came to...

visit my dad.

731
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:23,529
Mr. Marsh.
Mr. Marsh, guess what.

732
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:25,497
Your son is here.

733
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,435
I don't have a son.

734
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:33,706
Oh, come on, Mr. Marsh,
don't be a grumpy pants.

735
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:36,875
You tell that piece of shit
that if he wants to

736
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:39,345
talk to me,
he can write an email.

737
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,247
Tell that little pussy
if I had any grandkids,

738
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:44,216
maybe I wouldn't be so bitter

739
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:46,852
at having such a little bitch
for a son!

740
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,688
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh, hey, Stan.

741
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,091
I'll leave you two alone.

742
00:34:56,595 --> 00:35:00,466
So, looks like
the Broncos still suck.

743
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:01,867
Yup.

744
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,204
Well, it was nice seeing ya.

745
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,739
Thanks for coming to visit.

746
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,107
I didn't come to visit.

747
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,808
Trust me,
I don't want to be here.

748
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:13,212
Right, like you didn't
want to murder your sister.

749
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,148
What happened to Shelley
was your fault, not mine!

750
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:19,218
Yeah, like it was my fault
your mom shot herself!

751
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,253
Yes, it actually was!

752
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,890
Your mom died the day
her daughter burned to death!

753
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:29,495
I'm just here because of Kenny.

754
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:32,965
Why would he have
Tegridy Weed in his equations?

755
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,337
Dr. McCormick mentioned Tegridy?

756
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:41,740
It seemed to somehow fit
into some grand theory he had.

757
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:45,511
He knew. He knew
it was the way to fix it all.

758
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:50,482
He knew...
about the Pandemic Special.

759
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:56,255
But, Mom,
why do we have to leave?

760
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,856
It's not safe outside!

761
00:35:57,923 --> 00:35:59,358
We aren't welcome here,
children.

762
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:01,360
We have to find another
place to stay.

763
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:03,429
Oh, no, this is just like
when our people were

764
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,497
exiled from the Holy Lands.

765
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:07,766
Mrs. Cartman,
can I talk to you, please?

766
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,768
- Uncle Kyle!
- Uncle Kyle,

767
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,037
why are you making us go? Why?

768
00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:13,605
Is it 'cause we're Jews?

769
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,875
Mrs. Cartman,
I'm sorry for last night.

770
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:22,114
I was just... tired and it was
extremely inappropriate of me.

771
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,148
Dad!

772
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:24,450
I think Uncle Kyle

773
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,351
is gonna let us stay, Papa!

774
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:30,989
Uh, no, kids, I'm sorry, but we
can't stay here with Uncle Kyle.

775
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:34,626
Please stay.
I am asking you to stay.

776
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,029
Can we, Dad?
We'll be good, we promise!

777
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:39,364

Stop what?

787
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,522
We found Kenny's lab.

788
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:06,592
All of his confidential work
and his wild experiments.

789
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:10,362
Kenny wasn't just trying to find
the source of the coronavirus.

790
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:12,397
He was trying
to go back in time,

791
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:15,000
and stop the pandemic
from ever happening.

792
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,674
Okay, old people.

793
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,010
It's 4:00.
You know what that means.

794
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,879
It's share time!

795
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,749
Who has something that they
want to share?

796
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:32,050
Mr. Garrison?

797
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:35,053
I'd like to share
my dick in your mouth.

798
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,257
M'kay.

799
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:40,559
Okay, guys, let's settle down.

800
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:44,062
Look, I know sharing feelings is
hard during this time of crisis.

801
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:47,199
Is anyone feeling nervous
about the new COVID outbreak?

802
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,637
We don't want you to worry,
because, you know,

803
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,072
it's the future...
we all do everything we can

804
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:56,074
to make sure
old people don't die.

805
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,711
Okay, if nobody else
wants to go first,

806
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,647
Randy Marsh had
a little visitor today

807
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:04,249
and he'd like to share that
with all of you.

808
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:08,420
Uh, hey, everyone. I had
a special visitor today.

809
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:10,055
My "son."

810
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,791
Who hasn't come to see me
in over 20 years.

811
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:15,127
And I have some things
I need to tell him

812
00:38:15,194 --> 00:38:17,062
but it's hard because...

813
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:18,597
he killed his mom
and his sister.

814
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:21,066
Okay, okay,
here's what happened.

815
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,501
Oh, here we go, here we go.

816
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,970
After the pandemic,
my mom wanted a divorce

817
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:26,772
and she owned half of the farm.

818
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,274
She didn't own half,
she always hated weed,

819
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:30,842
and she didn't do shit
for the farm.

820
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,445
He wouldn't give her half
the farm, so I got sick

821
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:34,780
of their fighting
and decided to burn

822
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,615
the whole stupid farm
to the ground.

823
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:39,351
And his sister was in the barn
and she burned to death.

824
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:41,620
Because you locked her
in the barn 'cause she wouldn't

825
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:44,356
do her weed chores
'cause she hated weed, too!

826
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:46,525
Yes, she had
a marijuana problem.

827
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:49,094
And so his mother
couldn't take the loss

828
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:51,129
of Shelley
and so she killed herself!

829
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,831
Which is your fault.

830
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:54,199
You were the one who

831
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:55,434
burned the family business
to the ground.

832
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,902
You guys are hearing this,
right?

833
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:02,841
So, Kenny spends years
researching time travel,

834
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:04,710
then suddenly Kenny dies,

835
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,212
and all his fellow
scientists go missing.

836
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:09,948
Just leaving behind
a trail of blood.

837
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,284
Seems like all of
the scientists were murdered

838
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:14,820
so that nobody could
complete Kenny's work.

839
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:16,321
All of them except one.

840
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:18,223
In almost all this research,

841
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,860
one name keeps popping up:
Victor Chouce.

842
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:25,030
It appears that Chouce
was Kenny's right-hand man.

843
00:39:25,097 --> 00:39:26,698
But he was insane.

844
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:28,834
He's been locked up for years
inside a mental institution.

845
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,169
Oh, come on.
Now we're gonna start talking

846
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:32,838
to certifiably crazy people?

847
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,841
Crazy or not,
we find this Victor Chouce

848
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:38,844
and we find where
Kenny hid the information.

849
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,053
Yes.

850
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,755
Yes, that is correct.

851
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:52,758
Victor Chouce is
one of our patients here.

852
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:55,327
What is the nature
of your inquiry?

853
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:57,996
We have reason to believe
that Victor Chouce

854
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,899
can answer questions
regarding our friend's death.

855
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:02,934
Could you put him
on the line please?

856
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:05,203
I'm afraid that's impossible.

857
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:09,574
Victor is too unstable for
phone calls. They confuse him.

858
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:12,611
Well, can we come
talk to him in person then?

859
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:16,248
Yes, I believe
that could be arranged.

860
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:19,284
As long as
the proper protocols are met.

861
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:22,521
Is everyone
in your party vaccinated?

862
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,424
No.

863
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,459
Well, then
I'm afraid we can't allow you

864
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:28,960
into our facility.

865
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:32,197
But-but we have to talk to him!
It's urgent!

866
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:33,465
What'd they say?

867
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:34,866
They're not
gonna let us see him!

868
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,636
It's some kind of
goddamn conspiracy!

869
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,448
Listen to me, it's very simple.

870
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:51,883
I need to take my dad
out of here.

871
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,118
He has to come with me.

872
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:54,986
I'm afraid that's impossible.

873
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:57,656
Senior citizens are
in here to keep them safe.

874
00:40:57,723 --> 00:41:01,326
You know, it's the future...
we can't let old people die.

875
00:41:01,393 --> 00:41:03,895
- I told you, stupid.
- Shut up, Dad.

876
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,832
Look, there's a chance we
can help fight this new variant.

877
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:08,800
I just need him out for
a couple hours

878
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:10,302
so we can
get something important.

879
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:11,837
Well, why don't you
just go get it?

880
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:14,139
Because he won't tell me
where it is because

881
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:16,908
- he doesn't trust me.
- Because he killed his mom.

882
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:19,845
Look, I'm sorry,
but this is the future.

883
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,814
Nothing is more important than
keeping old people alive.

884
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:24,483
What if you took him out there
and, God forbid,

885
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:25,917
he crapped his pants?

886
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,452
And then slipped on
the old people diarrhea

887
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:28,854
and hit his head?

888
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,188
We'd have to shut down
the entire country,

889
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:31,256
for Christ's sake.

890
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,191
Well, I guess that's it.

891
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:35,761
Only one way out now.

892
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:40,532
Kick him in the balls, Stan!

893
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,000
- What?!
- Kick him in the balls!

894
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:44,336
- Come on, hurry!
- Get your hands off of me!

895
00:41:44,403 --> 00:41:45,971
- Dad!
- Goddamn it, Stan,

896
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:48,974
kick his fucking balls
so we can go!

897
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,509
Fuck!

898
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:54,446
Okay, grab his keys!
Grab his keys, you stupid ass!

899
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:02,988
Warning. Warning.
Old person has escaped.

900
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:06,224
Old person has escaped.
Warning.

901
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:17,536
All of these documents
we found in Kenny's lab

902
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:20,372
referred to possible origins
of the coronavirus.

903
00:42:20,439 --> 00:42:22,307
He wanted to go back
and stop it.

904
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:25,243
But to stop it, he had to
figure out how to bend time.

905
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:29,214
Exactly. There's notes...
years and years of research

906
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:30,582
that Kenny compiled...

907
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:32,751
all on the possibilities
of time travel.

908
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:34,853
You silly girl.

909
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,722
You, yes.
Who's a little mister, yes.

910
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:39,257
Who's a little hetzpah?

911
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:40,859
Who's my little meshugana?

912
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:42,394
Excuse me!

913
00:42:42,461 --> 00:42:43,995
Geez, sorry, Kyle.

914
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,398
Kenny was researching
the nature of space-time

915
00:42:46,465 --> 00:42:48,600
to see if some kind
of bending was possible.

916
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:51,603
But then suddenly, all
the research just gets cut off.

917
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,605
Because whoever
made the pandemic happen

918
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:55,874
killed Kenny before
he could go back and stop it.

919
00:42:55,941 --> 00:42:58,243
Silly girl. Yes.

920
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,445
Will you please knock it off?!

921
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:02,047
What's the problem, Kyle?

922
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:03,949
You know what you're doing,
fat-ass!

923
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:06,751
Goddamn it, why don't you lay
off my fuckin' dad, Uncle Kyle!

924
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:09,454
Moisha! He's never
talked like that before.

925
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:10,789
I'm sorry, Mom. It's just...

926
00:43:10,856 --> 00:43:13,124
Uncle Kyle,
he makes me so crazy!

927
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,026
That is not okay, Moisha.

928
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:18,797
But it's true, Dad.
Uncle Kyle makes me crazy, too!

929
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:21,266
- Menorah!
- Fuck you, Kyle.

930
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,301
Hackelm!

931
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:25,303
You guys, listen.
In Kenny's work

932
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,973
he talks about where he would
hide important information.

933
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:30,442
He says his friends
will always know where to look

934
00:43:30,509 --> 00:43:33,144
if they just
think like kids again.

935
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:36,181
Think like kids again...

936
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:40,085
I know where Kenny hid
what we're looking for.

937
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:42,387
It's up his ass.

938
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,594
Who's the broad?

939
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:51,730
That's just my Alexa.

940
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:54,165
That's the best
you could do, huh?

941
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:55,467
Is it even the new one?

942
00:43:55,534 --> 00:43:57,969
- Excuse me?
- Just ignore him.

943
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,906
Okay, fine, there's a new
upgrade available

944
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,507
for your Amazon Prime
membership.

945
00:44:02,574 --> 00:44:04,009
Would you like to know more?

946
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:05,443
Not now, please.

947
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:08,179
Okay, so I guess
just fuck me, then?

948
00:44:09,915 --> 00:44:11,850
Uh-huh.

949
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:30,802
This was once
such a magical place.

950
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:32,637
Can we just get this over with?

951
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:34,205
I don't want to be here.

952
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:35,807
You think I want to be here?

953
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:38,877
This is where I lost
everything that I cared about!

954
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:41,012
And your mom and your sister!

955
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,554
Dad, there's nothing here.

956
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:51,723
Dad?

957
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,491
I think I can
trust you now, Stan.

958
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:57,395
It's time for you to learn what
your friend Kenny was after.

959
00:44:57,462 --> 00:45:00,732
When the pandemic started,
you were only a kid.

960
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:04,202
You don't remember the pain
we all went through.

961
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:05,537
Yeah, I do.

962
00:45:05,604 --> 00:45:08,406
We as Americans
went through so much.

963
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:12,744
First, that incompetent
jack-hole was elected president.

964
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:16,247
Then the pandemic came,
and then the race wars.

965
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:20,352
And then just when it seemed
like we'd turned a corner,

966
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:25,757
Space Jam 2 came out,
and we all just kind of gave up.

967
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:29,260
What we lost,
Stan, was our Tegridy.

968
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:31,429
But it was all by design.

969
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:33,531
They needed us to lose it.

970
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:34,766
Who did?

971
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,435
Who would want us
to lose our optimism

972
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:39,871
and start fighting
with each other?

973
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:40,772
China.

974
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:43,775
- China?
- China.

975
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:46,044
They're the superpower now.

976
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,014
The future is totally theirs
and we let it happen.

977
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,616
A man in China
had sex with a pangolin

978
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:54,619
and that started COVID.
That man was me.

979
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:56,121
So I knew how to go back

980
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:57,622
and stop them
from taking over...

981
00:45:57,689 --> 00:45:59,357
Wait, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait.

982
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:01,059
You started COVID?

983
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:03,061
Yes, but that's
besides the point.

984
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:05,397
China used me
like they used us all.

985
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:08,466
So I came up with a way
to help everyone fight back.

986
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:10,835
A special Tegridy weed.

987
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:13,304
You had sex with a pangolin

988
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:16,241
in China and started
the whole pandemic?!

989
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:18,476
Will you listen
to what I'm saying?!

990
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:21,279
Gal!
I worked to create more Tegridy,

991
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:24,149
but China did everything
they could to stop me.

992
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:25,884
They even got to my son.

993
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,887
Who burned all of
Tegridy Farms to the ground.

994
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,222
But what you didn't even know

995
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:34,626
was that I had secretly
created a new strain of weed.

996
00:46:34,693 --> 00:46:38,730
A weed so powerful, I couldn't
even call it a special.

997
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:40,932
It was more like an event.

998
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:43,568
I hid it away all these years.

999
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:48,239
And now it... is the key
to saving us all.

1000
00:46:57,882 --> 00:46:59,851
- Where the fuck is it?
- What?

1001
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:03,154
The Tegridy Weed Special Event!
Where the fuck is it?!

1002
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,689
I don't know, Dad!

1003
00:47:04,756 --> 00:47:07,158
They got it. They took it!

1004
00:47:07,225 --> 00:47:09,094
There's even fresh
footprints on the ground!

1005
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,695
Oh, Jesus!

1006
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:12,831
So maybe it wasn't the Chinese.

1007
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:16,935
Yeah, no, it was definitely
the Chinese. Oh, God.

1008
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:20,605
That was it! That was
the very last bit of Tegridy!

1009
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:23,541
The only other thing I had
were some seeds that I hid

1010
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:27,479
up my ass, but they took them
from me at the old folks home!

1011
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:29,547
Wait a minute.
What did you say?

1012
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:32,650
I said they took them from me
at the old folks home.

1013
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:33,852
No, before that.

1014
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:37,322
Oh. I said I hid 'em
up my ass.

1015
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:41,559
Jesus. It's so simple.
How did we not get it?

1016
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:43,628
Alexa, start the car!

1017
00:47:44,596 --> 00:47:46,865
There's no point now, son!

1018
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,733
It's all gone.

1019
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,070
It's all lost. All lost.

1020
00:47:52,137 --> 00:47:55,306
Randy.

1021
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:58,343
Randy.

1022
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,578
Ah...?

1023
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:03,114
ICU, please. Blue Team, ICU.

1024
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:11,222
"Un-cle Kyle."

1025
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:16,327
"Uncle Kyle."
Say it, Hackelm.

1026
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:21,666
- "Uncle Kyle."
- Fuck you, Kyle.

1027
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:25,370
No, no, no.
"Uncle Kyle."

1028
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:26,738
Fuck you, Kyle.

1029
00:48:26,805 --> 00:48:28,840
Oh, my gosh, no.

1030
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:30,875
We're so sorry about this.

1031
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:33,678
Hackelm, say "Uncle."

1032
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:38,316
"Uncle. Uncle Kyle."

1033
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,286
Fuck you, Uncle Kyle!

1034
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:42,720
Hey, that was better.

1035
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:44,622
It isn't gonna work.
The hospital says

1036
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:46,691
we don't have authorization
to see Kenny's remains.

1037
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:47,959
What?!

1038
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:49,627
Sounds like someone
doesn't want us

1039
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:52,096
to see Kenny's remains.
'Cause we might find the truth.

1040
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:54,032
There has to be
a way for us to get in there.

1041
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,401
- Ha ha. Fuck you, Uncle Kyle!
- Hackelm.

1042
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:58,703
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

1043
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,472
- Stan?
- What are you doing here?

1044
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:03,975
I've been trying to
find out who killed Kenny.

1045
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:06,611
I think I know where he
stored the information.

1046
00:49:06,678 --> 00:49:07,812
It's in his asshole.

1047
00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:09,247
- Yes.
- Well, it doesn't matter.

1048
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:10,815
They won't let us
into the morgue.

1049
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:12,584
Yeah, that's because
you guys don't think.

1050
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,952
Excuse me?
We need to examine

1051
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:15,987
the remains of Dr. McCormick
right away.

1052
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:17,622
Like I told the others,

1053
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:20,558
only certified medical personnel
are allowed to examine cadavers.

1054
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,260
Stan Marsh, consultant

1055
00:49:22,327 --> 00:49:25,163
for Post-Modem Beveragetainment
Online Services.

1056
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:28,433
One moment, Doctor.

1057
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:30,235
This is highly unorthodox.

1058
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,670
We don't normally allow
outsiders into the morgue.

1059
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:36,808
That's understandable, Doctor,
but luckily I am orthodox.

1060
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:38,943
I don't think this
is suitable for children.

1061
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,279
You guys go.
You were the closest to him.

1062
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:43,381
We'll stay back
and watch the kids.

1063
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:47,185
I'm sorry we can't
supply any chin diapers.

1064
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:49,187
Just maintain social distance.

1065
00:49:49,254 --> 00:49:50,955
Middle cabinet,
second from the bottom.

1066
00:50:07,939 --> 00:50:09,674
Hello, old friend.

1067
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:12,944
Ah, come on!

1068
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:17,849
Well, let's get him...

1069
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:19,284
turned over.

1070
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:25,290
Somebody's got to look.

1071
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,058
I'm not reaching up Kenny's ass.

1072
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:28,559
Well, somebody has to.

1073
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:30,161
- Cartman, go ahead.
- No, I can't do it.

1074
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:31,496
If anyone should reach up
Kenny's ass,

1075
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:32,897
it should be you, Kyle.

1076
00:50:32,964 --> 00:50:34,666
I thought you were
his fucking "best friend."

1077
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:37,635
I was his best friend,
but I am also married,

1078
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:40,071
so I can't be fingering
people's buttholes.

1079
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:42,507
God, you guys fucking suck.
I'll just do it.

1080
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:44,742
Just like I always had to
fix fucking everything else!

1081
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:52,550
You did not
"fucking fix everything,"

1082
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:55,386
you just started acting like
everyone else was stupid.

1083
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:58,323
Oh, really? Because
they were acting stupid?

1084
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:00,725
Yeah, because you got all
self-righteous about everything.

1085
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:03,161
- I got self-righteous?
- Yeah, you got self-righteous.

1086
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:05,196
Do you know what
fucking sanctimonious means?

1087
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:07,198
No, Kyle, why don't you
fucking tell me

1088
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:08,900
what fucking
sanctimonious means.

1089
00:51:08,967 --> 00:51:10,401
See, this is exactly
how you acted when

1090
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:12,170
- the pandemic started to...
- Wait!

1091
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,237
Hold on.

1092
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:15,640
We've got it.

1093
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,379
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1094
00:51:21,446 --> 00:51:24,615
It's got shit on it.
That's dead people shit.

1095
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:32,123
What are you working on, Clyde?

1096
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,125
I'm going through
Kenny's journals again

1097
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:35,693
to try to find some answers.

1098
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,463
Seems like we just keep hitting
dead ends, you know?

1099
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:40,798
I'm just tired
and I want to go home.

1100
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:43,368
I know. I'm exhausted, too.

1101
00:51:46,004 --> 00:51:48,806
You want to maybe
do a little bump?

1102
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:50,041
Huh?

1103
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:51,409
I was just...

1104
00:51:51,476 --> 00:51:53,978
I've got some coke
and I thought we could...

1105
00:51:54,045 --> 00:51:56,214
I don't know,
do you want to party?

1106
00:51:57,181 --> 00:51:58,816
Fuck yes, I want to party.

1107
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:00,318
- Really?
- Fuck yes.

1108
00:52:00,385 --> 00:52:02,220
Oh, I'm so glad you're down.

1109
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,288
Nobody else is even cool enough
for me to ask.

1110
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:05,990
It's pretty good shit, too.

1111
00:52:06,057 --> 00:52:09,160
Oh, man. Thank God.

1112
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:10,428
Thank God I brought this.
Here ya go.

1113
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:13,197
Fuck yes.
Let's fucking party.

1114
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:15,633
Wait a minute.

1115
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:18,836
- What is this really?
- What do you mean?

1116
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:22,073
This isn't cocaine, it's
the COVID vaccine, isn't it?!

1117
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,675
I'm not putting
that shit in my body!

1118
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:26,444
Forget it, guys, it didn't work.

1119
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:30,681
You guys were gonna trick me
into taking the vaccine?!

1120
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:32,850
Goddamn it, Clyde,
we want to get out of here!

1121
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:36,120
My body is a temple
and I'm not taking that shit!

1122
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:38,356
Let's just face it, guys,
it's over.

1123
00:52:38,423 --> 00:52:40,691
We're never going to find
what Kenny was after.

1124
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,994
Whoever controls the world
and killed our friend

1125
00:52:43,061 --> 00:52:44,662
is just gonna get away with it.

1126
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:46,230
Not so fast!

1127
00:52:48,433 --> 00:52:51,869
We did it! We found Kenny's
hidden information!

1128
00:52:51,936 --> 00:52:53,805
- You did?
- And now we can finally

1129
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:54,806
learn the truth!

1130
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,207
Whoever Kenny was after,

1131
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:58,776
we are gonna
take those fuckers down!

1132
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:06,384
The date is November 3rd.
It is 2:07 p.m.

1133
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:08,853
Dr. Kenneth McCormick
will now be

1134
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,888
attempting to travel back
in time.

1135
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:14,959
In order to stop the COVID
pandemic from ever happening.

1136
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:16,727
He did it?

1137
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:18,196
Dr. McCormick believes

1138
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:19,197
that going back

1139
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:20,665
is the only way

1140
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:23,367
to stop the people
who have ruined the future.

1141
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:25,970
In the event of
Dr. McCormick's death,

1142
00:53:26,037 --> 00:53:27,872
he wants everyone
to know the group

1143
00:53:27,939 --> 00:53:30,341
that is responsible
for the way things are.

1144
00:53:30,408 --> 00:53:33,044
It is,
"My three dickhead friends,

1145
00:53:33,111 --> 00:53:35,480
Stan, Kyle and Cartman."

1146
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:37,248
What?!

1147
00:53:37,315 --> 00:53:39,083
Dr. McCormick says

1148
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,252
that these three
completely ruined everything

1149
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:43,654
when they let COVID
break up their friendship

1150
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,924
and became argumentative,
combative, pessimistic assholes.

1151
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:51,562
He says he hopes
you guys are watching this.

1152
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:58,769
He spent his whole life
trying to fix your broship

1153
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:00,771
and then realized
this was the only way,

1154
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:02,240
'cause you guys suck.

1155
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:04,942
The sequence is active!

1156
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:07,111
The historic moment is here!

1157
00:54:07,178 --> 00:54:08,913
Godspeed, Dr. McCormick!

1158
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:13,718
Wait! Dr. McCormick,
you forgot your chin diaper!

1159
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:16,587
Something's wrong!

1160
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:46,717
All this time,
the bad guys we were after,

1161
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:51,422
who Kenny said ruined
the future, was you guys?

1162
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,724
Wendy, I've been trying
not to say anything but...

1163
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,694
your friends are all
kind of douchebags.

1164
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:02,066
Kenny was right.

1165
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:04,235
All this time,
we've been trying to figure out

1166
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:06,904
whose fault this all was.

1167
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:08,839
It was our fault.

1168
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:11,075
I remember when we were kids.

1169
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:13,644
We were so optimistic.

1170
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:17,415
We lost that.
We lost our sense of fun.

1171
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,784
Our sense of humor.

1172
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,787
Maybe the pandemic
was a big test.

1173
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:25,323
And we all failed.

1174
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:27,858
Let's face it, guys.

1175
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:29,860
We killed Kenny.

1176
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:34,699
Yeah. Kenny was right.

1177
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:37,468
Back in the old days,
we wouldn't give up like this.

1178
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:39,370
We would have just set out
to save our friend,

1179
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:41,439
no matter how impossible
it seemed.

1180
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,374
What we would have done...

1181
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:45,042
and what we
should have done then...

1182
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:46,944
was double down on our respect

1183
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,714
and our love for one another
and fight through it

1184
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,149
instead of
fighting with each other.

1185
00:55:52,216 --> 00:55:53,884
We can save Kenny.

1186
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:55,620
We just have to finish his work.

1187
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,222
How? We don't know anything
about quantum physics

1188
00:55:58,289 --> 00:55:59,824
and time travel.

1189
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:03,394
I don't know how.
But we start by believing.

1190
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:06,330
In each other
and in what is yet to come.

1191
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:09,867
We have to go back to being
those kids we once were.

1192
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:13,404
Even if it means
calling Jesus or Santa.

1193
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:15,239
Come on, guys,
we've got work to do!

1194
00:56:15,306 --> 00:56:18,142
Sounds good.
I'll be right back.

1195
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:21,912
Moisha, Hackelm, kids,
get your things.

1196
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:23,047
We need to go now.

1197
00:56:23,114 --> 00:56:24,515
What's going on, Dad?

1198
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:26,717
Your Uncle Kyle wants to
go back and change things.

1199
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:29,153
He's going to try
and change the past.

1200
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,756
But I like things
the way they are.

1201
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:34,725
Me too, Dad. Do you think
he'll be able to do it?

1202
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:36,260
No, kids.

1203
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:38,095
Fuck Uncle Kyle.

1204
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:39,263
Yay!

1205
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,332
- Yay, Daddy!
- Fuck Uncle Kyle!

1206
00:56:45,169 --> 00:56:47,438
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

1207
00:56:47,505 --> 00:56:50,608
People were supposed to
get kinder in the future.

1208
00:56:51,442 --> 00:56:54,111
I'm so sorry
what happened to both of you.

1209
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:56,947
It wasn't your fault, Randy.

1210
00:56:57,014 --> 00:56:59,283
It was all Stan's fault.

1211
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,920
Yes, it was all Stan's fault.

1212
00:57:03,688 --> 00:57:05,890
Thanks for saying that,
you guys.

1213
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:08,426
I'm sorry Stan
sucks so hard sometimes.

1214
00:57:08,492 --> 00:57:10,795
Don't give up, Randy.

1215
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:12,797
Humanity needs you.

1216
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:14,465
No!

1217
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:16,734
I can't do it alone!

1218
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:20,304
How can things possibly go
back to the way they were?

1219
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:34,919
It can't be.

1220
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:36,354
It's impossible.

1221
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:42,960
It's the last little
sprout of Tegridy.

1222
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,168
I have to get you
somewhere safe.

1223
00:57:51,235 --> 00:57:53,571
We have a lot of work to do.

1224
00:58:14,425 --> 00:58:18,629
We just had another call asking
to speak with Victor Chouce.

1225
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:21,532
You're quite a popular man,
Victor.

1226
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:27,605
I wonder what
all the fuss is about.

1227
00:58:30,608 --> 00:58:34,345
Don't feel like talking, huh?

1228
00:58:34,412 --> 00:58:36,614
You will.
