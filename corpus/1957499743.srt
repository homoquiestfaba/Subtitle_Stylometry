00:00:01,691 --> 00:00:04,524
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:17,328
(bright instrumental music)

3
00:01:31,907 --> 00:01:33,943
- [Man] Kitty, come on, let's get ready!

4
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:37,369
Kitty?

5
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,797
- Fellas?

6
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:42,670
That's your daddy callin'.

7
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,433
They're done, let's go.

8
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:49,098
Hot, hot.

9
00:01:53,088 --> 00:01:54,421
Oh, damn-nation!

10
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,880
Fellas, where are ya'?

11
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,831
- Come on, come on.

12
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:07,031
- Come in, it'll be fun.

13
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,140
The whole family's gonna go.

14
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,680
You'll be all alone if ya' stay here.

15
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,993
- Right ma', bingo.

16
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,460
Ma'...

17
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,360
Sittin' around with those fine families

18
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,240
of Jackson ain't my idea of excitement.

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,620
You know, maybe I'll just
head over to the drugstore,

20
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,070
and see who's hangin' around.

21
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,710
- Now, I know we just got here and all,

22
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,030
but this time is different,
we're here to stay.

23
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,150
So, you can take your time
to get to know people, and...

24
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,050
Oh, go slow, Phyllis, not so fast.

25
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,650
- What do you mean by that, Ma'?

26
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,673
- Lewis, here's your shirt!

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,170
You know, he got that application
for agriculture college,

28
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,010
ain't that somethin'?

29
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,610
Now, are you coming or not?

30
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,126
- Yeah, let Lewis go on and
dig up dirt if he wants to.

31
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:56,640
I'm gonna be in the sky somewhere, Momma.

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,010
Look, see, just like that.

33
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,590
That's gonna be me one day.

34
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,683
I'm gonna be a pilot.

35
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,470
- Are you comin' with the family or not?

36
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,403
Lewis and everybody's all set to go.

37
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,570
- [Phyllis] Lewis, Lewis, Lewis.

38
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,600
I don't see no crown or diadem

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,820
that made him king around here.

40
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,870
- Don't break my pie.

41
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,680
Oh, don't worry, Lyle, we'll get callouses

42
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,880
on those pretty city
hands of yours in no time.

43
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,713
- [Lyle] Great.

44
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:28,210
- [Betty] Don't say that, Mama,
that's what he's afraid of.

45
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,360
- Would you get my hat?

46
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,930
Now, what are you doin', Boo?

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,380
- Maybe my Mardi Gras beads
will grow into a crop, huh Mom?

48
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,660
- Well, maybe they will.

49
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,523
Come on, you'll get your hands all dirty.

50
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,160
Button up that dress.

51
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:53,398
(serene instrumental music)

52
00:03:56,663 --> 00:03:58,613
- Look at that pretty house.

53
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:01,380
Who lives there?

54
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,023
- Why, that's Mr. Driggs house.

55
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,250
They're tellin' me the
Driggs family just about

56
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,800
owns the whole town in Jackson.

57
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,320
- Someday we're gonna
have a place like that,

58
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,150
and people will come visit us.

59
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,317
And we'll say, "Come back anytime

60
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:19,500
"because we'll be right here."

61
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,750
Isn't that right, George?

62
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,023
Oh, yes...

63
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:25,673
A place like that.

64
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:33,925
(mid-tempo country folk music)

65
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:36,175
(laughing)

66
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:42,314
(mid-tempo country folk music)

67
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:47,052
(clapping)

68
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:49,290
- [Man] Sheriff Ashford's
got somethin' important

69
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,440
to talk to y'all about.

70
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:54,686
(clapping)

71
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,900
- Folks, got a lot to be proud of here

72
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,100
in the town of Jackson,

73
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,330
where we truly cherish the
values and traditions...

74
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:09,170
That make American the
great country it is.

75
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,800
John Jackson founded this
town many years ago...

76
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,533
With a few dollars and a dream.

77
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:17,170
The dream of buidlin' a good, safe place

78
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,270
to raise your kids up.

79
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,650
Mr. Radley here is gonna take that dream

80
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,911
into the very near future.
- That's right!

81
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:27,781
- When he picks a spot,
he's gonna start buildin'

82
00:05:27,781 --> 00:05:29,783
what they're callin' suburbs.

83
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:32,600
Hopefully, right before Christmas,

84
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,250
and that's gonna be quite
a Christmas present for you

85
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:39,650
in our fine town of Jackson, thank you.

86
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,740
(clapping)
- Outstanding, outstanding!

87
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,357
Sheriff, that was terrific!

88
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,610
- Excuse me, anybody
taken this spot over here?

89
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,610
(mid-tempo country music)
(laughing)

90
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,337
Come on, now, kids, play nice!

91
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:19,843
(laughing)

92
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:21,693
That girl is stubborn as
hell and bold as brass.

93
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:26,768
- [George] She takes after her mom.

94
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:27,601
- It's about time she
started lookin' around

95
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,340
for a good husband to take care of.

96
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,634
I dont know what she's thinking.

97
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:35,653
She said some crazy thing
today about flyin' an airplane.

98
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,960
- We gonna have us a home now.

99
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,683
Nobody runnin' us off.

100
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,127
- Can't got callin' us
fruit tramps anymore.

101
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:49,377
- That's right.

102
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,842
(slow country music)

103
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:00,500
May I have this dance?

104
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,900
- Well, I'd be honored, sir.

105
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:06,698
(slow country music)

106
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,360
- Sorry, folks...

107
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,140
Hate to inform you, but this
here's private property.

108
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,840
You're gonna have to be movin' on.

109
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,423
Goes for you too, Sam.

110
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,337
You know better than that.

111
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,000
- Excuse me, Sheriff, I don't
understand what you mean.

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,949
- No mixin' with the colors ma'am,

113
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:37,840
that's what I mean.

114
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,590
Now, my job is to make sure
everyone knows their place,

115
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:43,853
and now it's time for
you to move on, ma'am.

116
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,800
- Sheriff, Mr. Driggs
owns the land we live on,

117
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,140
we rent it from 'em, we
got a two year lease.

118
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,700
Now, he has a paper that says that.

119
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,300
Well, tell me, Sheriff, does
anybody have a piece of paper

120
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,763
that says they own us?

121
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,860
- Little boy, you wanna last around here,

122
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,050
you better understand
who you're talkin' to.

123
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,067
- Oh, I understand who I'm talkin' to.

124
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:13,707
- Please, I don't want no trouble.

125
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:17,843
I don't want no trouble.

126
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,563
Nice meetin' you, Sheriff.

127
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,193
Why don't you come out and
have supper with us sometime?

128
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,513
- Thank you, thank you,
but I don't think so.

129
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:41,621
Come on, Billy.

130
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,700
- [George] Man makes the law down here.

131
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,790
- Good for you, Lewis.

132
00:08:58,757 --> 00:09:00,010
- [Phyllis] That man
thinks he pees champagne.

133
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,739
- [Lewis] Yeah, and he
sweats cream and sugar.

134
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:04,489
- Now, we're just outsiders is all.

135
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:08,087
People ain't got a chance
to get to know us yet.

136
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:15,903
(tranquil instrumental music)

137
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:37,042
- [Woman] No, honey, I told
you I'm not gettin' those.

138
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:40,511
(soft instrumental music)

139
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:41,801
- [Girl] How about this one, Momma?

140
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:42,900
- [George] Afternoon, Mr. Cooper.

141
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,733
- George.

142
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:48,130
- Ah, can you advance us $5
worth of cornmeal, please, sir?

143
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:48,963
- Alright.

144
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,710
Your total owed is $63.
- Yes, sir.

145
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,044
- And that don't count
the seed and fertilizer

146
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:01,027
that we had in advance.
- I know, I know.

147
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:03,090
- Y'all gettin' ready to
start harvestin' out there?

148
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,949
- That's right, that's right,

149
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:06,916
and in a few weeks we'll
clear that bill up,

150
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:07,883
and we sure appreciate your help.

151
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:18,301
- [Kathryn] Afternoon, Sheriff.

152
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,601
- Good afternoon, Sheriff.

153
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,653
Good afternoon.

154
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,750
Well, how you doin', Sheriff, good?

155
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,710
We doin' just fine, thank you.

156
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,005
We gonna be harvestin' soon,

157
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:28,930
then my momma says we're
gonna get ourselves a house...

158
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,063
- Phyllis, let's go, come on.

159
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:33,474
- Trash.

160
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:34,747
- You can say what you want to,

161
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:35,930
and do what you want to, but I can't!

162
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,800
- It isn't that, it's just us Messengers

163
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,440
don't tell people our business, come on.

164
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,440
Let's go.

165
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:52,561
Let's go.

166
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:56,712
(engine stuttering)

167
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,600
- I'll sure be happy when we see

168
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,690
the last of that Yankee trash.

169
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,830
- Well, as long as there is
land around here for rent,

170
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,310
you ain't gonna see the last of them.

171
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,463
But I here Radley's got his
eye on the land they rent.

172
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,363
- Well, you heard right,
I'm just waitin' now.

173
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,100
Good oranges.

174
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,353
(crying)

175
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:38,205
- [Man] Come on y'all, get out of there.

176
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:41,909
- Monsters, Ma'.

177
00:11:44,618 --> 00:11:45,785
Monsters, Ma'!

178
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,713
- Monsters, where at?

179
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,590
No, no, I don't see no monsters,

180
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,261
except for the monsters right here

181
00:11:57,261 --> 00:12:01,766
are the monsters!

Goodnight, ladies.

(slow trumpet music)

192
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,343
- Thank you.

193
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:56,568
(distant laughing)

194
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,115
- [Lyle] Don't talk to me
like that, you're my wife.

195
00:12:59,115 --> 00:13:00,483
- [Betty] Hey, come on
inside, Momma's waitin'.

196
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:02,333
- [Lyle] I dont care, we married now.

197
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:04,710
(laughing)

198
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,016
- I'm gonna have a little drink.

199
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:07,091
- [Betty] Oh, come on, love.

200
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:08,214
- [Lyle] Just let me have one drink, okay.

201
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:09,326
- Come on, you've had enough to drink.

202
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:10,696
- I'll decide when I've
had enough to drink.

203
00:13:10,696 --> 00:13:12,250
- Honey, come on inside.

204
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,617
- Don't like 'em much, do you, Ma'?

205
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,863
- I like 'em fine.
- I don't trust him.

206
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,350
- He's family now, Phyllis,
don't be talkin' against family.

207
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,693
(scoffs)

208
00:13:26,693 --> 00:13:28,484
- I don't wanna talk about it.

209
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:30,370
- Come on, Lyle, what
have you got to lose?

210
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,300
- Right now, nothin',
and I aim to change that.

211
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,100
- Damn it, Lyle, you come
back here and talk it out now!

212
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:42,191
(slow trumpet music)

213
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:10,611
(slow instrumental music)

214
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:19,920
- [Kathryn] What'd you write, June?

215
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,843
- Had me a beautiful,
exciting, and wonderful year.

216
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,986
- Surprise!

217
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:36,333
- [Kathryn] Happy Birthday, honey!

218
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,333
- Thank you!

219
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:40,530
- Happy Birthday, honey.

220
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,630
- [Kathryn] Well, doesn't anybody
want birthday cake but me?

221
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,185
- Me!

222
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:44,602
- [Phyllis] I do!

223
00:14:45,497 --> 00:14:46,330
- Come on, make a wish.

224
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,163
- Okay...

225
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:49,340
Hmm...

226
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,173
Alright.

227
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,090
(knocking)

228
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,001
- Oh, Mr. Cooper.

229
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:57,220
Why don't you come on in
and have some cake with us?

230
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,340
- No, thank you...

231
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,643
Ma'am, ah, George?

232
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:04,677
Could you step out here,
I'd like to talk to ya'.

233
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,713
- Alright.

234
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,053
Yes, sir.

235
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,110
- George, I'm sorry, but I gotta collect

236
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,933
that money you owe on your account.

237
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:18,743
- I see, ah...

238
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,040
Well, Mr. Cooper, we don't
the $63 right now, but...

239
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,210
- It ain't $63.

240
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:30,053
See, here, it says $232.76.

241
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,683
But I didn't sign for this.

242
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,210
Mr. Cooper, we was in your
store just the other day,

243
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,320
and that's the last time I...

244
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,897
- Last night, Lyle Nathan walked in,

245
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,730
and said you needed more supplies,

246
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,463
and said you sent him over
there to pick up the stuff.

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,920
Well, he said wrong because I dont know

248
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,333
nothin' about that now.

249
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:56,360
Well, since it's a family debt,

250
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,793
we'll stand good for it.

251
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,743
- I need the money now,
it's just much too high.

252
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,970
- Well, Mr. Cooper, if you
can just give us three weeks.

253
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,320
Now, that crops gonna come in,

254
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,610
and we'll have ya' money.

255
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,683
How's that sound?

256
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,093
- How's that sound?

257
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,400
Like you can't pay your
bill is what I'm hearin'.

258
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,570
Well, let's just go talk
to Lyle Nathan right now,

259
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,610
and get this thing straightened out.

260
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:33,173
(knocking)
- Betty, hon, you in there?

261
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,700
Honey, get Lyle out here.

262
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,100
Where is Lyle?

263
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,070
- He's gone.

264
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:45,990
- [Kathryn] He's what?

265
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,008
- He's ran off.
(crying)

266
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:48,953
- What in the hell?

267
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:50,505
- [Kathryn] Where's he
gone, Betty, what happened?

268
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:52,290
- [Betty] I dont know!

269
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,520
- Lyle Nathan's run off,

270
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,210
and how do I know you ain't gonna follow?

271
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,790
How do I know that he ain't waitin'

272
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,150
for you out there somewhere?

273
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,133
I want my money by the end of the week!

274
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,310
- Well, Mr. Cooper, why would we run off

275
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,420
with these crops comin'
in in just a few weeks?

276
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,143
Now, we'll get you your
money, don't, Mr.Cooper!

277
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,853
Look, we'll see what we can sell!

278
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,473
- [Betty] Ma', I'm so sorry.

279
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,920
- Betty, it isn't your fault.

280
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,033
It would've broke my heart
if you had gone with him.

281
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,610
You tried the best you could,

282
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,990
but sometimes life has a
way of handin' you things

283
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,423
that you don't expect.

284
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,143
- He used to say that people
acted like we're trash.

285
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,190
He used to say the
Messengers are just a bunch

286
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,143
of dreamers suckin' on their teeth.

287
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,820
- Don't you let that
boy make you feel small.

288
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,803
Don't let anybody make you feel small.

289
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,070
Baby, I know how much
you're hurt right now.

290
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,993
It'll take awhile, but
everything's gonna be okay.

291
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,633
I promise you.

292
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,363
Your hair's gotten so long.

293
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,010
Why don't we cut you some bangs tomorrow,

294
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,660
that way you can see
what's coming next time.

295
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:30,957
- Night, Ma'.

296
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,880
- Good riddance is what I say.

297
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,343
I saw it comin' a mile off.

298
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,483
- I bet you did.

299
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,610
- So, you still want me to find a good man

300
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,310
like Lyle to take care of me, Ma'.

301
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,850
- We got a lot of talkin' to do.

302
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,810
We'll talk in the morning, Phyllis.

303
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,540
- Yeah, sure we will.

304
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,224
You'll just be fussin' over Lewis,

305
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:20,050
and starin' at that stupid
picture of that stupid farm!

306
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,930
Nobody listens to me around here, Ma',

307
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,130
I got places I wanna go
and things I wanna do.

308
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,780
Damn, I sure wish I lived in the city,

309
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,700
because I hate it here, I hate it here!

310
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,920
And all you do is fuss...

311
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,640
- Phyllis, if you are so unhappy here,

312
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,710
then why don't you just
head on to the city?

313
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,959
You're a great big girl now,

314
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:35,950
you can do what you want to.

315
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,783
Go on.

316
00:19:36,783 --> 00:19:38,182
- [Phyllis] Maybe I will.

317
00:19:38,182 --> 00:19:39,015
- You hate this, and you hate that,

318
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:40,330
you are just plain hateful.

319
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,410
And that'll get you nowhere fast.

320
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,250
So, go on, then.

321
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,200
- And goin' nowhere fast seems
to be the style around here.

322
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,820
- [Ashford] Get your money, Cooper?

323
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,470
- No.
- They robbin' you alright.

324
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,640
They're all in it together.

325
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,440
- Them tent farmers are like animals.

326
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,510
They sleep together like a pack of dogs.

327
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,890
- They said they'd have the
money by the end of the week.

328
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,593
- They said, they said?

329
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:16,517
What guts at work, a bunch of transients.

330
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:19,513
A bunch of transients!

331
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:24,473
Just a pickin' fruit,
movin' from place to place.

332
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:28,150
I ant accept that, Cooper.

333
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,810
You can't change a leopard's spots.

334
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,363
I got a job to do now.

335
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,700
Besides, we gotta start breakin' ground

336
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,983
on that land soon enough.
- Yeah.

337
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:44,819
- That's right.

338
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,793
- Well, that's it, we're
never gonna make $232.

339
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,053
It's all in the land, and
half of that ain't ours.

340
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,633
This is from Betty.

341
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,060
- George Messenger!

342
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,783
This is the Sheriff, I'd
like to have a word with you!

343
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,950
(buzzing)

344
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,102
- Yes, sir, Sheriff.

345
00:21:55,102 --> 00:21:57,269
(cocking)

346
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,113
Mighty, Sheriff.

347
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,530
Now, I told you we were
gonna pay you that money.

348
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,580
- [Ashford] You're under
arrest for obtaining property

349
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,730
under false pretenses at the Cooper store.

350
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,831
Come on, boys.
- No, no, wait.

351
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,500
No, look, we ain't don't
anything wrong, now hey!

352
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,073
We just can't pay the grocery bill!

353
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:19,327
- Sir, he didn't do nothin'!
(screaming)

354
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:25,286
- Don't do that!
- Get your hands off us!

355
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:28,044
- Betty, get back in the house!

356
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:31,794
(pensive instrumental music)

357
00:22:35,612 --> 00:22:38,029
(shrieking)

358
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:42,968
(screaming)

359
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:48,257
(pensive instrumental music)

360
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:07,702
- [Girls] Monsters, Ma'!

361
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,003
- [Kathryn] Monsters, where at?

362
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,033
- [Officer] Hey, Messenger, catch.

363
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,353
- [Woman] You want me to help you?

364
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,373
Here.
- Thanks.

365
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,010
- A couple, George and Kathryn Messenger

366
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,350
are now held in Santa Rosa
County Jail in Jackson.

367
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,350
They bought under false pretenses
$700 worth of merchandise:

368
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,040
including a large refrigerator, radio,

369
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,116
22 Automatic rifle, and a tractor?

370
00:23:58,116 --> 00:24:00,360
- That's not true, that's lies.

371
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,360
Oh my God, they put them
lies in the newspaper.

372
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,490
- Mr. Messenger, did not resist arrest,

373
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,520
but his wife resisted,
kicking, biting, and scratching

374
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,990
so that the three officers
were forced to use

375
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,736
main strength to get
her into the police car.

376
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:15,486
(laughing)
- Alright, that's true.

377
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,020
- [Woman] And there's more.

378
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,830
Three juveniles have been trans...

379
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:24,983
(screeching)
(honking)

380
00:24:24,983 --> 00:24:25,862
- What?

381
00:24:25,862 --> 00:24:28,195
(screaming)

382
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,213
What?

383
00:24:33,213 --> 00:24:34,960
- [Woman] Three juveniles
have been transported

384
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,983
to Fair Crest Youth Home
for state supervision.

385
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,890
- Fair Crest, what kind of place is that?

386
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,090
My little girls never spent a day

387
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,350
in their life without me in Georgia.

388
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,360
- It's a foster home for kids.

389
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,630
The state of Florida
takes care of the children

390
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,193
when they lock up the folks.

391
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,891
- I would like you all to say
hello to our new arrivals.

392
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:03,460
- Hello.

393
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,043
- Now, who would like to explain
the rules to the new girls?

394
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,303
Emily?

395
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,343
- There's dogs.

396
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:19,720
- Why don't you show our new
guests what you mean by that?

397
00:25:22,863 --> 00:25:26,160
Well, come on, Emily, be
a good girl, and show 'em.

398
00:25:40,962 --> 00:25:42,524
Ha!

399
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:46,941
(growling)
(barking)

400
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:54,422
(screeching)

401
00:25:56,395 --> 00:25:58,523
(banging)

402
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,440
- Shh, shh!

403
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,183
Look!

404
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:04,223
Now, you can write to your kids,

405
00:26:04,223 --> 00:26:06,331
and let 'em know you're okay.

406
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,183
And you can make sure that they are too.

407
00:26:09,576 --> 00:26:11,576
And you can follow it in the papers too.

408
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,493
Okay?

409
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,170
You can't read, can you.
- Not too good.

410
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:28,087
- I mean, look, it's okay.

411
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,254
I'll help you.

412
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,153
- Thanks.

413
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,392
- Juney May.

414
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,740
You always wanted your own bed, right.

415
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,190
Now, you don't have to share.

416
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,813
- You lookin' for trouble, darlin', huh?

417
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,513
- Here, this is from Elsa, the cook.

418
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,590
- Thank you.

419
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,440
- She's alright, you can always
count on her to help out.

420
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,163
Look, you stay away from Old Man Virgil.

421
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,470
You don't want him to
fancy you, that's for sure.

422
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,630
Do you know where your folks is?

423
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,713
Did they run off?

424
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,090
That's okay, I dont know
where my folks is neither.

425
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,063
- [Officer] Alright, time to go.

426
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,223
Just the boy.

427
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,803
- Watch your step, son.

428
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,913
- G, good girl, okay.

429
00:27:50,988 --> 00:27:51,821
Truth.

430
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,652
- T...

431
00:27:55,652 --> 00:27:56,485
R...

432
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,650
(pensive instrumental music)

433
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:37,484
- Sheriff!

434
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:39,567
- Oh, here comes trouble.

435
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,550
- What can I do for ya', boy?

436
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,640
- Someone stole our crop.

437
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,720
Now, what are you gonna do about that?

438
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,900
- Well, I'll start an
investigation right away.

439
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,021
Of course then again, those crops was owed

440
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,660
on some bills, seems to me.

441
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,950
- Them crops were worth
a lot more than a bill.

442
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,193
Now, you know that, a lot more!

443
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,260
That's my mother's shawl.

444
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,490
That's my mother's shawl!

445
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,607
Where did you get that?

446
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:08,860
You stole it, you stole it!
- You're mistaken, boy.

447
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,693
- You stole it!

448
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:12,133
- I want you out of Jackson in one hour,

449
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:14,775
or I'm gonna arrest you for vacancy.

450
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:18,023
Better get his butt out of here.

451
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:20,707

- You two are charged
with attaining property

472
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,740
under false pretenses.

473
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,140
A felonious action against
the state of Florida.

474
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,460
Mr. Cooper.

475
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,347
- George and Kathryn
Messenger obtained $232.76

476
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,370
worth of merchandise and they couldn't pay

477
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,780
when the time had come.

478
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,883
I've got the receipt right here.

479
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,640
They claimed they could cover
the bill with their crops,

480
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,993
but they could not.

481
00:31:28,568 --> 00:31:32,318
(pensive instrumental music)

482
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,880
- Is there anything you
wish to say in your defense?

483
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,103
- We never seen them supplies, now.

484
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,741
My son-in-law bought that stuff.

485
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:47,610
(pensive instrumental music)

486
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:51,033
- We need to set down clear
what is right and wrong.

487
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:54,953
The Messengers here did wrong.

488
00:31:57,618 --> 00:32:01,368
(pensive instrumental music)

489
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,300
- The jury finds the Messengers guilty

490
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,600
of obtaining property
under false pretense.

491
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,850
George and Kathryn Messengers
you have been found guilty

492
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,420
of a felonious action against the peace

493
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,860
and dignity of the state of Florida.

494
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,200
It is therefore the judgment of this court

495
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,600
and the sentence of the law
that you each be confined

496
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,765
to hard labor in the state
prison in the state of Florida...

497
00:32:25,765 --> 00:32:28,283
For and during a period of seven years.

498
00:33:00,488 --> 00:33:04,238
(pensive instrumental music)

499
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,521
- [Girls] Monsters, Ma'!

500
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:17,104
- [Kathryn] Monsters, where at?

501
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:23,133
(pensive instrumental music)
(slamming)

502
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,163
- Hmm...

503
00:33:27,582 --> 00:33:30,720
What a shame to cut such beautiful hair.

504
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,973
Mm-mm-mm.

505
00:33:34,397 --> 00:33:36,020
Well...

506
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,193
That's the rules.

507
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,520
- Can you help me, please?

508
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,600
Can you help me about my kids?

509
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,640
- Your children are at the wards

510
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,273
of the state of Florida now.

511
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,613
Don't worry, they'll be put
up for adoption right away.

512
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,833
They'll be taken care of.

513
00:34:21,855 --> 00:34:26,855
(whistling)
(slow blues music)

514
00:34:40,082 --> 00:34:42,415
(whistling)

515
00:34:46,296 --> 00:34:48,582
- Howdy, I'd like to pass through, please.

516
00:34:48,582 --> 00:34:50,915
(whistling)

517
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,490
- Don't walk so fast,
we ain't goin' nowhere,

518
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,556
except back where we started.

519
00:34:56,556 --> 00:34:59,450
- Not me, I'm gettin' out
of here, you watch and see.

520
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,633
- I'd like to see my client, named Logan.

521
00:35:06,383 --> 00:35:08,716
(whistling)

522
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,043
- Lo!

523
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:12,779
Step out!

524
00:35:15,237 --> 00:35:17,570
(whistling)

525
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,093
- Hi, Ms. Logan.

526
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,263
- Who's that?
- Her lawyer.

527
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,703
Her family hired him to get her an appeal.

528
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,180
- [Kathryn] I guess her people
got money to pay him, huh.

529
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,260
- Yeah, she say they
have a care dealership.

530
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,496
I seen him do charity
cases a couple of times.

531
00:35:38,496 --> 00:35:40,146
He brings a good magazine though.

532
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,750
- You think he'd help me about my kids?

533
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,950
- The boss man hates his guts.

534
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,783
You be careful.

535
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,233
- Water guard?

536
00:35:57,668 --> 00:35:58,998
- Hands!

537
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:00,081
Hands, hands!

538
00:36:08,226 --> 00:36:09,790
- [Kathryn] Mister, can
I talk to you a minute.

539
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,290
I'm Kathryn Messenger, I
just need to talk to you.

540
00:36:13,244 --> 00:36:15,742
(screaming)

541
00:36:15,742 --> 00:36:17,361
- Proceed on lie.

542
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:19,444
To take it under control!

543
00:36:26,457 --> 00:36:27,540
Back in line!

544
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:42,739
- Shh, shh, shh!
(shrieking)

545
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:45,688
Now, shoosh, come on, be a good girl, now.

546
00:36:45,688 --> 00:36:48,718
Don't give me no trouble, be a good girl.

547
00:36:48,718 --> 00:36:51,684
Oh..
(shrieking)

548
00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:54,017
(screaming)

549
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,813
Damn!

550
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:01,381
(suspenseful instrumental music)

551
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:30,322
- Come here, boys, come
on, come on, doggies.

552
00:37:30,322 --> 00:37:32,928
Come on, doggies, come here.

553
00:37:32,928 --> 00:37:35,853
Good boy, good boy, come here.

554
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,670
Good boy.
(screaming)

555
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,547
Oh, my God!

556
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,507
(screaming)

557
00:37:40,507 --> 00:37:42,573
Get off of me!
(screaming)

558
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:46,447
- Calm down, honey, those
dogs aren't gonna bite you.

559
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:49,630
Now, there, you are not to say anything.

560
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,015
Now, you go pack your bags.

561
00:37:52,015 --> 00:37:54,350
You're gonna get your wish.

562
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,713
You're leavin' Fair Crest.

563
00:38:00,741 --> 00:38:02,296
- Please don't go.

564
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:04,493
- Honey, I ain't got no choice.

565
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,030
Every night, once you go to sleep,

566
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,537
I'll have my arms around you.

567
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,130
- Every, every night?

568
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,727
You won't forget?
- Never.

569
00:38:21,943 --> 00:38:23,780
- [Virgil] Time to go!

570
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,393
- You listen to me, come here!

571
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:29,773
Don't you ever let anyone make
you feel small, you got that?

572
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:34,200
Especially that old man,
Virgil, you stay away from him.

573
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,100
You understand me?

574
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:39,040
Okay.

575
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,540
- [Virgil] Phyllis, right now!

576
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:45,473
- Okay, be big girls now.

577
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:47,743
Here, you have this.

578
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,620
Take care of each other.

579
00:38:54,155 --> 00:38:56,659
(solemn instrumental music)

580
00:38:56,659 --> 00:38:58,559
Come on, go back to bed, it's alright.

581
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
I'm comin' back for you.

582
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:11,273
(solemn instrumental music)

583
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,517
(slow blues music)

584
00:39:41,532 --> 00:39:43,865
(whistling)

585
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,925
- Honey, you okay?

586
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:48,825
You're runnin' on low gear these days.

587
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,360
- They got my kids.

588
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:56,586
My girl, Phyllis, we had been fightin'

589
00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:58,263
the night we was picked up.

590
00:39:59,828 --> 00:40:01,723
I didn't treat her fair.

591
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,183
- She won't hold it against ya'.

592
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:12,102
- [Lawyer] Logan.

593
00:40:12,102 --> 00:40:13,463
- Logan, step out!

594
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,607
(slow blues music)

595
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:34,135
(whistling)
(slow blues music)

596
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,032
- Washroom, guard.

597
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:44,615
- [Guard] Step out.

598
00:40:46,538 --> 00:40:49,455
(slow blues music)

599
00:40:55,227 --> 00:40:56,373
- Excuse me, sir.

600
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,208
Look, they took my kids, I just wanna know

601
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,828
they're alright, that's all.

602
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:04,299
Can you help me?

603
00:41:04,299 --> 00:41:07,420
I'm Messenger, Kathryn Messenger...

604
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,113
- Ma'am, you better go back.

605
00:41:14,826 --> 00:41:15,843
(shrieking)

606
00:41:15,843 --> 00:41:18,143
- You got hearin' problems,
don't you, Messenger?

607
00:41:19,028 --> 00:41:19,861
Don't you!

608
00:41:21,287 --> 00:41:22,313
I warned you.

609
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,240
- And Sands, I told you
to follow the rules,

610
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,707
now get outta here, leave!

611
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,230
- Messenger, I warned you.

612
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:33,877
- This ain't right.

613
00:41:33,877 --> 00:41:36,050
- Did I hear you say somethin'?

614
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:36,883
- This ain't right.

615
00:41:36,883 --> 00:41:39,117
- I sure hope I didn't
hear you say nothin'!

616
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:42,299
- It ain't oughta be like this!

617
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:43,173
Give me somethin' real to do!

618
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:46,128
This is ain't right!
- I'm warnin' you!

619
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,128
Matron, box!

620
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,213
Get up!

621
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:59,713
(wary instrumental music)

622
00:42:02,775 --> 00:42:05,108
(whistling)

623
00:42:10,766 --> 00:42:14,266
(wary instrumental music)

624
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:24,588
(whistling)

625
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:34,418
(pensive instrumental music)

626
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,903
Your hearin' improve, Messenger?

627
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:47,529
I didn't get that!

628
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,263
I guess your hearin'
is not fixed yet, huh?

629
00:42:57,189 --> 00:42:58,022
Well...

630
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:07,183
I guess you need another five days, huh?

631
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,150
- [Kathryn] Wait, wait...

632
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:16,070
- Alright, now...

633
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,453
Who are you?

634
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,773
- [Kathryn] 634, sir.

635
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,593
- That's right.

636
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,180
Why are you here?

637
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,730
- [Kathryn] Broke the law, sir.

638
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:31,803
(gasping)
- Whose fault was that?

639
00:43:33,806 --> 00:43:37,920
- [Kathryn] (crying) Mine, sir.

640
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,297
- How much time left?

641
00:43:40,297 --> 00:43:43,353
- [Kathryn] Six years, sir.

642
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:48,353
- Hmm, and who owns you
for the next six years?

643
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,820
- [Kathryn] You do, sir.

644
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,163
- Well...

645
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,333
Let's get you cleaned up a little bit.

646
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:41,083
We got a little reward for you, Messenger.

647
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,447
Just what you asked for.

648
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:25,181
(footsteps)

649
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:31,630
- Messenger, I'm gonna
give you some good advice.

650
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,803
You keep goin' after your kids,

651
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,020
they are gonna grow up with the smell

652
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,610
of jailbird Momma on 'em.

653
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:45,820
Folks can sniff that out a mile away.

654
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,313
And they're gonna straight down the tubes,

655
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,540
but you leave your kids alone,

656
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,483
they might end up with new folks,

657
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,893
folks who can take care of 'em real good.

658
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,923
Better than you ever could.

659
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,580
See, without you, your children may stand

660
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,983
a chance in this life.

661
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:17,287
You already done the best
thing you ever could for 'em...

662
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:20,433
By gettin' yourself locked up in here.

663
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,867
You see what I mean.

664
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:33,130
- Sir, I'd like to...

665
00:46:34,717 --> 00:46:36,123
I'd to finish here now.

666
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:41,680
- Alright, now, that's
the kind of attitude

667
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,433
we like to see here.

668
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:50,367
I think we are goin' to get along

669
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:54,293
real fine from here on out.

670
00:47:13,382 --> 00:47:16,882
(slow instrumental music)

671
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:07,200
(pensive instrumental music)

672
00:48:17,378 --> 00:48:21,487
(shattering)
(coughing)

673
00:48:21,487 --> 00:48:23,445
(slow instrumental music)

674
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:24,862
- Mrs. Messenger?

675
00:48:26,228 --> 00:48:29,656
(slow instrumental music)

676
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,906
Mrs. Messenger?

677
00:48:35,026 --> 00:48:37,297
No, no, no, it's alright, it's alright,

678
00:48:37,297 --> 00:48:39,047
it's okay, it's okay.

679
00:48:40,523 --> 00:48:42,363
It's okay, you're safe now.

680
00:48:43,636 --> 00:48:45,479
(slow instrumental music)

681
00:48:45,479 --> 00:48:46,312
- Safe?

682
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:51,564
Why?

683
00:48:51,564 --> 00:48:53,420
Are you an angel?

684
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,130
- I'm Bill Sandstrom...

685
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:58,383
I took the liberty of
lookin' into your case.

686
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:04,523
Now, I'm gonna try and
get you out of here.

687
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:10,420
And I ain't no angel and no
devil neither, just a lawyer.

688
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,960
- We didn't mean to break the law.

689
00:49:15,201 --> 00:49:17,893
We didn't mean to, we didn't know we was.

690
00:49:17,893 --> 00:49:19,979
(crying)
We didn't mean to!

691
00:49:19,979 --> 00:49:22,060
- Mrs. Messenger, you have
not committed any crime,

692
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,533
you're innocent, you hear?

693
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:29,010
Now, listen to me, and this is our deal...

694
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:33,640
You and me, we're gonna
overcome this thing,

695
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,247
and we ain't given up
because you are innocent.

696
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,280
- Right.

697
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,173
- You damn straight, that's right.

698
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,078
(ringing)

699
00:50:08,578 --> 00:50:10,828
(knocking)

700
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,823
Hello, Judge.
- Mornin', Bill.

701
00:50:17,862 --> 00:50:19,833
- Lord, it's hot, ain't it?

702
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:29,300
Alright, the Messenger case...

703
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,800
You see, George and Kathryn Messenger

704
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,853
have been convicted of a
crime that does not exist.

705
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:42,380
Obtainin' property under false pretenses.

706
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:46,227
Now, these folks had
a grocery bill of $232

707
00:50:47,433 --> 00:50:50,853
that they could not pay
until their crops came in.

708
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:57,280
False pretenses refers to
the false solicitation,

709
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,809
which if I'm right is not the cause,

710
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:02,033
not the running up of a grocery bill.

711
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:08,240
Now, you know and I know
that nobody in this country

712
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,573
can be jailed for debt.

713
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:13,220
Lewis...

714
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,713
They were wrongly convicted.

715
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,523
I demand their immediate release.

716
00:51:22,716 --> 00:51:26,216
(slow instrumental music)

717
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,880
- Habeas corpus granted.

718
00:51:47,173 --> 00:51:49,721
(pensive instrumental music)

719
00:51:49,721 --> 00:51:51,630
(laughs)

720
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:53,107
- I dont know how to thank you.

721
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:57,170
If it wasn't for you...
- Look, Kitty...

722
00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:00,020
I'll tell ya' how ya' can
thank me, now listen carefully.

723
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,583
Don't you ever lose faith again.

724
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,520
I know what it's like to lose faith.

725
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:14,260
They've done a terrible thing to you,

726
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,623
and the fact is, you
won't ever forget that.

727
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,300
But from now on, you've got to hold

728
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,160
your head up no matter what.

729
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:29,823
That's it.

730
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:33,740
(laughing)

731
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:34,990
That's it, now.

732
00:52:35,937 --> 00:52:38,780
And you keep it right there, alright?

733
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,430
- Alright.

734
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:42,030
Mr. Sandstrom, I'll try my best.

735
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,243
- Alright...

736
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:46,343
Alright.

737
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,313
Now...

738
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,463
Here's the addresses of your children.

739
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:57,540
My office tracked 'em down.

740
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,800
And here's a post card that
just come to you from your kids.

741
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,923
Now, I'm gonna send all
your stuff onto Sweet Ridge.

742
00:53:12,535 --> 00:53:15,763
And here's $50 from the state.

743
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,360
Guess they figured
that's all they owed you.

744
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,693
Now, where you headed?

745
00:53:30,258 --> 00:53:32,283
Fair Crest Youth Home.

746
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:35,420
- Gosh...

747
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,263
Oh, boy, I gotta go.

748
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,233
- Hey...

749
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,493
You are an angel.

Everything's gonna be alright.

- Mornin', Ma'am.

778
00:58:48,336 --> 00:58:49,169
- [Woman] Hello.

779
00:58:49,169 --> 00:58:50,870
- We're here to pick up our children.

780
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:51,840
- [Woman] And who are you?

781
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,730
- George and Kathryn Messenger,

782
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,350
our daughters are here,
June, Annette, and Phyllis.

783
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,303
- Just a minute.

784
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,210
- Do I look alright?
- Oh, you look beautiful.

785
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:05,760

handsome yourself, sir.

786
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:06,940
- [George] Awe, thank you, ma'am.

787
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:10,127
- I'll be needin' to take
a look at the court order.

788
00:59:11,587 --> 00:59:12,420
- Court order?

789
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,390
- Your parental rights have been severed.

790
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:17,470
You must now be approved by
the child welfare department

791
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,253
in order to be reinstated
as parents of the children.

792
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:24,010
Your children have already
been put up for adoption.

793
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:24,843
- They what?

794
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:28,300
We were found innocent.

795
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,520
- Where's my girls?

796
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,420
I wanna talk to my girls.

797
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,630
- I can't do nothin' for ya'

798
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:35,530
till you come back with a court order.

799
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:41,750
Besides, the big girl,
she ain't even here.

800
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,203
- She ain't here!

801
00:59:43,203 --> 00:59:46,730
- She's been transferred to the residence

802
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:49,394
for delinquent girls in Ocala.

803
00:59:49,394 --> 00:59:51,520
- She no delinquent girl!

804
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,353

805
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,343

Don't, I believe your father turned

905
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:05,793
into a liar in that jail house.

906
01:06:06,711 --> 01:06:08,961
(laughing)

907
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:12,803
- We got a letter from the girls for you.

908
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,460
Want me to read it for ya'?

909
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:19,483
- No...

910
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:22,263
I can.

911
01:06:25,279 --> 01:06:28,379
- What she talkin' about?
(laughing)

912
01:06:28,379 --> 01:06:33,379
- "Dear Ma', remember Ma' when
you'd be out in the field.

913
01:06:37,257 --> 01:06:41,557
"Sometimes, and me, and Annette would come

914
01:06:41,557 --> 01:06:43,043
"and think with you?

915
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,727
If some...
- Body.

916
01:06:47,727 --> 01:06:52,617
- "Body, somebody, ever gave me a wish.

917
01:06:52,617 --> 01:06:56,533
"I'd wish us all together.

918
01:06:58,337 --> 01:07:02,110
"They say we have to go to new...

919
01:07:04,617 --> 01:07:07,623
"Families at Christmas.

920
01:07:08,777 --> 01:07:11,603
"We're sorry for what we did wrong.

921
01:07:12,807 --> 01:07:16,273
"We promise to be good.

922
01:07:19,377 --> 01:07:20,210
"Please...

923
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:26,237
"Come get us, we'll
make Christmas for real.

924
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,910
"Love June & Annette."

925
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:30,973
Would you look at how Boo made her name?

926
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:35,100
- [Lewis] Momma, we're gonna
have to get you a library card.

927
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:40,100
- Library card?
(laughing)

928
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:41,480
- Now, we gonna get an application

929
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,103
from them child welfare people?

930
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,970
And we're all gonna have to work,

931
01:07:49,737 --> 01:07:52,487
and we're gonna save enough
to get these youngin' back.

932
01:07:57,846 --> 01:08:01,096
- I love you, Pappa.
- I love you, baby.

933
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:08,722
- We'll get 'em back, Momma.

934
01:08:08,722 --> 01:08:10,392
- What do you think of me, huh?

935
01:08:10,392 --> 01:08:11,263
- You did great.

936
01:08:11,263 --> 01:08:16,263
- What do you think of me?
(laughs)

937
01:08:22,219 --> 01:08:23,052
(knocking)

938
01:08:23,052 --> 01:08:25,520
- Hello, I'm Mrs. Karsten
from Child Welfare,

939
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,120
I'm here about your application.

940
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,533
- [George] Come on in.

941
01:08:32,313 --> 01:08:35,260
I work the night shift,
you see, and I was, ah...

942
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:40,550
Well, shoot, I wish I'd
have known you was comin'.

943
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:45,017
Kitty, my wife, she'd of wanted
to be here to talk to ya'.

944
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:52,890
Everybody else is out.

945
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:55,860
My wife, she's workin' the
lunch shift at the Five & Dime.

946
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:58,510
She'll be back this afternoon though.

947
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,560
Maybe you could wait.

948
01:09:00,598 --> 01:09:02,127
- Oh...
(chuckles)

949
01:09:02,127 --> 01:09:03,710
- No, I reckon not.

950
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:08,820
Have you had lunch?

951
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,250
I can heat you up some real nice

952
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,072
turtle soup from last night.

953
01:09:12,072 --> 01:09:12,905
- No.

954
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,027
- Well, everybody else is out workin'.

955
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:19,343
We all work.

956
01:09:21,618 --> 01:09:23,560
- We like to make these visits as casual

957
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,120
and relaxed as possible, that's
why we arrive unannounced.

958
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:26,953
- Mm-hmm.

959
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,153
- So, who is everybody?

960
01:09:31,153 --> 01:09:34,653
- Well, there's Kitty,
my wife, like I said.

961
01:09:36,008 --> 01:09:39,923
And Lewis, my son, and Betty, my big girl.

962
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,073
- And all of y'all live here?

963
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:49,293
In such a small place?

964
01:09:51,528 --> 01:09:54,278
- Now, I'm sorry you have to
see us livin' like this...

965
01:09:56,634 --> 01:09:58,234
But this here is just temporary.

966
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,290
Until we can save up enough
to get our little girls back.

967
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:04,423
- I see.

968
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:07,033
- She was here?

969
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:09,653
What'd she say?

970
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:11,890
- [George] Not much.

971
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,010
- What'd you say?

972
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:20,083
- Well, I offered her some
lunch, some turtle soup.

973
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,280
- You offered her turtle soup?

974
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,430
Good lord, George, did you tell her about

975
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,330
our jobs, and plans and all?

976
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:30,087
- Well, of course I did.

977
01:10:30,087 --> 01:10:30,920
- [Kathryn] So, what'd she say?

978
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:31,833
- Not much.

979
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:36,593
- Not much?

980
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:39,620
Well, what'd you say?

981
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,580
Is that all you said?

982
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:46,440
You offered her soup and that was it?

983
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,273
That was it?

984
01:10:47,273 --> 01:10:48,993
- Dammit, Kitty, I told her the truth.

985
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:53,040
Now, what was I supposed to tell her?

986
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:56,050
That we're savin' up to buy a farm?

987
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:58,270
That we got $300 already saved up?

988
01:10:58,270 --> 01:11:01,710
And if we keep at it,
maybe, maybe, maybe, no.

989
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:02,543
No.

990
01:11:03,758 --> 01:11:06,607
I told her we wanted our
girls back is what I told her.

991
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,730
- Did you tell her how much we love 'em?

992
01:11:12,594 --> 01:11:13,427
- [George] I told her we wanted
the girls back, that's it.

993
01:11:17,476 --> 01:11:19,726
(slamming)

994
01:11:26,225 --> 01:11:27,058
- Ma'!

995
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:29,753
It's here.

996
01:11:33,361 --> 01:11:36,227
- The State of Florida
Child Welfare Department.

997
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,583
- You need me to read it for ya', Ma'?

998
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,000
- Dear Mr. & Mrs. Messenger...

999
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,830
The State of Florida has
considered your request,

1000
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:03,900
your request has been denied.

1001
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:04,733
- [Lewis] What!

1002
01:12:04,733 --> 01:12:06,071
- Denied?

1003
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:08,904
(heavy breathing)

1004
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,480
- [Kathryn] I have business here.

1005
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,822
- We're closed.

1006
01:12:15,822 --> 01:12:16,655
- I have official business here!

1007
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,498
Explain this to me.

1008
01:12:23,498 --> 01:12:24,822
- I'm sorry, we're closed now.

1009
01:12:24,822 --> 01:12:26,656
You're gonna have to come back tomorrow.

1010
01:12:26,656 --> 01:12:27,580
- No, you explain this to me right now,

1011
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:29,703
or you won't be seein'
tomorrow, God help me.

1012
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:35,820
- It says you have been denied adoption.

1013
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,793
- I know that, why?

1014
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,193
Why?

1015
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:55,260
- Your children were interviewed

1016
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,440
by perspective adoptive parents.

1017
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,290
It looks as if they've
found new homes for them.

1018
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:01,670
It was the decision of the state

1019
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:03,550
that this was the best thing for them.

1020
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:05,200
They will be moved December 23rd.

1021
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,132
- Alright, how much do you want?

1022
01:13:08,132 --> 01:13:09,900
- I beg your pardon.
- This is what I have.

1023
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,300
This is what we have
saved, is that enough?

1024
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,927
- Look, lady, I'm sorry...
- Is that enough?

1025
01:13:12,927 --> 01:13:14,590
Is that enough, how much?

1026
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:17,080
- Lady, I'm sorry, but the
decision has been made.

1027
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,490
Not by me, but by the state of Florida.

1028
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:20,790
It's for their own good.

1029
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:23,105
- No, no, who the hell
is the State of Florida?

1030
01:13:23,105 --> 01:13:24,179
- Pete, Pete!

1031
01:13:24,179 --> 01:13:25,030
- Now, you name the price!

1032
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,120
How much for my kids?

1033
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,349
They're my kids!

1034
01:13:27,349 --> 01:13:29,217
They're my kids, they're my children!

1035
01:13:29,217 --> 01:13:30,667
Get your hands off me!
- Go!

1036
01:13:31,905 --> 01:13:35,738
- I got a right to an answer!

1037
01:13:35,738 --> 01:13:37,162
I got a right to an answer.

1038
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:38,482
- [Guard] Don't you come back!

1039
01:13:38,482 --> 01:13:40,426
- What are you lookin' at?

1040
01:13:40,426 --> 01:13:41,462
- Go on!

1041
01:13:41,462 --> 01:13:43,010
- What are you lookin'
at, the poor white trash?

1042
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:44,310
Well, go ahead, take a look!

1043
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:47,439
Just take a look, and you tell me then!

1044
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:52,439
Then you tell me then!
(crying)

1045
01:13:53,367 --> 01:13:55,038
- [Guard] Go on, I'll have you arrested!

1046
01:13:55,038 --> 01:13:56,662
- [Kathryn] They're my blood!

1047
01:13:56,662 --> 01:13:57,712
- Get on out of here!

1048
01:14:00,095 --> 01:14:03,345
(screaming)
Go, go on!

1049
01:14:04,276 --> 01:14:06,443
(yelling)

1050
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:09,364
(crying)

1051
01:14:19,636 --> 01:14:20,650
Oh, no good.

1052
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:21,483
Oh, no good.

1053
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:23,953
Girls, I'm sorry.

1054
01:14:31,889 --> 01:14:33,972
(crying)

1055
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:39,903
Denied.
(crying)

1056
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:47,910
(slow instrumental music)

1057
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,910
- You about ready to come home?

1058
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:25,460
- George, listen to me...

1059
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,780
Back at prison...

1060
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,150
They got to me...

1061
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,633
And I gave up.

1062
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:40,570
I just wanted it over.

1063
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:46,423
I tried to kill myself.

1064
01:16:06,935 --> 01:16:07,768
- Well...

1065
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:14,023
I reckon the good Lord wasn't
finished with you yet, was he?

1066
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,013
You looky here, we gon'...

1067
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:27,173
Somehow or another, we gon'
find a way to move on from here.

1068
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,163
We have to.

1069
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:31,467
We just...

1070
01:16:33,135 --> 01:16:35,835
We're just gonna find a way
to make it right together.

1071
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:42,130
- My Georgie...

1072
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:47,580
How could I have ever
wanted to quit on you?

1073
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,510
On the family...

1074
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:54,410
I'm ashamed, I'm sorry, I'm...

1075
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:59,033
I'll make it up to you.
- Shh, shh, shh.

1076
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:09,313
- Oh, yes, I wanna go home.

1077
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,623
We got work to do.
- Yeah.

1078
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,703
- We got work to do.
- Yeah, yeah.

1079
01:17:25,604 --> 01:17:29,021
(mid-tempo piano music)

1080
01:17:42,346 --> 01:17:47,013
(ringing)
(conversing)

1081
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:03,350
- Excuse me...

1082
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:07,003
Ah, excuse me, gentlemen!

1083
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:09,690
Florida took my kids away,

1084
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:11,520
and nobody will listen to me!

1085
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,570
And I need one of you to write my story,

1086
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,160
so that people will read it.

1087
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:19,032
Now, I have been reading the law.

1088
01:18:19,032 --> 01:18:23,113
And I have a letter from my daughter.

1089
01:18:24,437 --> 01:18:26,510
Hey...
(knocking)

1090
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:29,050
Hey!
(whistling)

1091
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:30,723
My mother's talkin' here!

1092
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:35,070
- My children are in trouble.

1093
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:36,960
And nobody'll listen to me,

1094
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,240
and I need one of you to help me out.

1095
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,510
- Somebody get rid of this cornball.

1096
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:43,676
- I want equal justice under the law.

1097
01:18:43,676 --> 01:18:44,560
(laughing)

1098
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,580
- Equal justice under
the law means I'm free

1099
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:48,752
to tell you to get out of here.

1100
01:18:48,752 --> 01:18:50,558
(laughing)

1101
01:18:50,558 --> 01:18:52,860
- And I can leave on my own.

1102
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,744
- [Man] Well, then why don't you do so?

1103
01:18:54,744 --> 01:18:56,653
(laughing)
- Thank you.

1104
01:18:56,653 --> 01:18:57,677
Come on, Betty.

1105
01:18:57,677 --> 01:19:02,010
- [Man] Leave her behind.
(laughing)

1106
01:19:11,586 --> 01:19:12,520
- Excuse me, ma'am.

1107
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,870
Ma'am, excuse me...

1108
01:19:15,979 --> 01:19:18,373
I think you left this behind there.

1109
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,500
- Please help me.

1110
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,490
- No, this ain't my
beat, I do international.

1111
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:26,140
- You read my letter, didn't ya'?

1112
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,719
You know what I'm saying
is true, don't ya'?

1113
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:31,250
- I dont know nothin' to
be true about you lady.

1114
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:34,333
I dont know you.
- Oh, yes you do.

1115
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,480
You know me...

1116
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,370
You know my kind.

1117
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:41,803
Look at me.

1118
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:47,640
Now, you can turn around and walk away,

1119
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,963
and pretend you don't, but we know better.

1120
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:53,963
Please help me.

1121
01:19:56,725 --> 01:20:00,225
(slow instrumental music)

1122
01:20:01,865 --> 01:20:06,250
- Alright, look, I can't
promise you anything, alright.

1123
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,123
Come see me in my office tomorrow.

1124
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:10,533
We'll talk about it, okay.

1125
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,043
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

1126
01:20:20,379 --> 01:20:25,379
(slow instrumental music)
(laughing)

1127
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,633
- Morning, son.

1128
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:44,922
- You scared me to death.

1129
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,490
- Listen, I was wondering
if maybe you could do

1130
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:51,260
one more thing for me.

1131
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:52,093
- [Man] One more thing?

1132
01:20:52,093 --> 01:20:53,870
I haven't done the first thing yet.

1133
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:54,703
Now what?

1134
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:58,850
- I have to apply for a
court hearing, it's...

1135
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:05,263
A petition for an appeal
to the juvenile court.

1136
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,160
And I wonder if you could just explain

1137
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,120
some things for me I've been readin'.

1138
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:14,400
- Sure, why not, I'm not busy or anything.

1139
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,460
Shoot.

1140
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:16,293
- Well, I...

1141
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,153
Sorry...

1142
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:22,993
- It's okay.

1143
01:21:22,993 --> 01:21:23,826
- I've been readin' the Constitution,

1144
01:21:23,826 --> 01:21:26,180
and I think that it's the law

1145
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:27,790
that the court is supposed to follow.

1146
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:30,470
And I want this down in my appeal.

1147
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:32,330
- Watch the monkey, please.

1148
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:36,260
- I have to send for an
original, three copies,

1149
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:40,659
a T1080 Notice of Motion form.

1150
01:21:40,659 --> 01:21:43,050
Color coded with a docket number,

1151
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:45,613
and date of decision,
whatever the hell that is.

1152
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,810
- Mrs. Messenger, you haven't been goin'

1153
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:52,500
to law school, have ya'?

1154
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,263
- Shoot, I never did have
school after the first grade.

1155
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:59,490
My people was migrants,
you know, fruit tramps.

1156
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:01,800
Anyhow, now I've been learning.

1157
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,970
And, well, a woman helped me out at...

1158
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:08,003
And...

1159
01:22:09,019 --> 01:22:10,420
I go to the library.

1160
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:13,250
Anyway, could you explain
them things to me?

1161
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:16,440
I figure that I can send my petition

1162
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,300
right before your newspaper article.

1163
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,036
That way maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe

1164
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:22,070
when they read your story,

1165
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,003
they'll accept my petition.

1166
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:28,160
- You know, when you walked
into that press room I thought

1167
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:33,653
there goes one hard headed
woman, here comes trouble.

1168
01:22:34,986 --> 01:22:36,436
And I was right.
- Yes, sir.

1169
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:40,530
- Look, I can't promise you that

1170
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:42,810
they're gonna run what I write,

1171
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:46,523
but I will do the best that
I can, okay, I really will.

1172
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,950
- I know you will.
- I know you know.

1173
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:52,463
- Thank you.

1174
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:57,340
- Hey, lady, you're Kathryn Messenger.

1175
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:58,810
- Good lord, why?

1176
01:22:58,810 --> 01:23:00,347
- Quite a picture, lady.

1177
01:23:00,347 --> 01:23:02,140
- Look, Ma'!
- Oh, heavens.

1178
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,399
- Oh, it's you!
- Let's see it.

1179
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:05,585
Would you look at that?

1180
01:23:05,585 --> 01:23:06,951
That's about, that's me.

1181
01:23:06,951 --> 01:23:09,657
- Good luck to ya'.
- Thanks so much, thank you.

- I'm right behind you.

1194
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:53,470
- You should give this woman a chance.

1195
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:57,030
No one in this town has got the nerve

1196
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:58,580
to stand up to Sheriff Ashford.

1197
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:02,553
You might as well let her
be the first one to try.

1198
01:24:03,785 --> 01:24:06,080
(slow blues music)

1199
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:06,913
Chicken?

1200
01:24:08,303 --> 01:24:09,870
- What?

1201
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:11,693
- Would you like some more chicken, dear?

1202
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:16,250
(slow blues music)

1203
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,293
- Mornin', Judge.

1204
01:24:26,293 --> 01:24:27,126
- [Judge] Mornin', Sheriff.

1205
01:24:27,126 --> 01:24:29,070
- Sarah Louise.
- Good mornin'.

1206
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:32,240
- Judge, can I have a little
word with you a minute?

1207
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,892
- Sure, Joe, ah, excuse me, darlin'.

1208
01:24:34,892 --> 01:24:35,725
- Of course.

1209
01:24:35,725 --> 01:24:37,630
- Sarah Louise, your cookin'
sure smells good, honey.

1210
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:38,923
- Thank you, Sheriff.

1211
01:24:38,923 --> 01:24:40,137
- [Ashford] You look like you've been

1212
01:24:40,137 --> 01:24:41,120
puttin' on a little weight.

1213
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:47,634
Next time we go fishin', you
might just sink the boat.

1214
01:24:47,634 --> 01:24:49,210
(chuckles)

1215
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:52,116
Now, Wyatt, I assume you ain't gonna let

1216
01:24:52,116 --> 01:24:54,710
this Messenger business go any further.

1217
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:56,820
- Joe, we got a problem.

1218
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:59,280
And it's all down here in black and white.

1219
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,200
- I got a problem too,

1220
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,340
that's doin' the job I was elected to do.

1221
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,570
- Joe, it ain't gonna
go away by ignorin' it!

1222
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:06,933
- I got a job to do!

1223
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:11,033
And that's preservin'
law and order, so do you.

1224
01:25:11,884 --> 01:25:13,270
Now you watch yourself.

1225
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:15,123
Take it easy on those potatoes.

1226
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:18,530
You don't wanna go sinkin' the boat.

1227
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,430
- [Kathryn] I can't do this, George.

1228
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:26,831
- [George] We're on our
way to get the kids.

1229
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:27,820
- [Kathryn] On our way to Jackson Court,

1230
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:29,773
where they locked us
up in the first place.

1231
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:32,773
I'm scared.

1232
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,290
Plain ol' scared.

1233
01:25:40,892 --> 01:25:44,642
(pensive instrumental music)

1234
01:25:56,410 --> 01:25:58,910
(baby crying)

1235
01:26:10,001 --> 01:26:13,710
- [Officer] The State of Florida
versus Kathryn Messenger.

1236
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:16,853
- Mrs. Messenger, you may
address the court now.

1237
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:27,933
- Mr. Justice Black, Ray
Oliver, 333 US 257273,

1238
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:38,173
identifies these rights as
essential for a fair trial.

1239
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:44,930
The person's right to reasonable notice

1240
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:49,930
of a charge against him and
an opportunity to be heard.

1241
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:51,700
- Will that be all, Mrs. Messenger?

1242
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,780
- Who are you?

1243
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,760
- I'm Will Leroux, Your Honour.

1244
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,460
- He's a newspaper reporter, Your Honor,

1245
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:02,850
he's been writing some articles.

1246
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:05,450
- A newspaper man has no business here.

1247
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:07,400
He's gonna have to leave the courtroom.

1248
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,333
Go on, get.

1249
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,770
- No, he has every right to be here.

1250
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:14,850
Every right.

1251
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:16,210
The freedom of the press.

1252
01:27:16,210 --> 01:27:19,527
You, you have no right
to tell him to leave.

1253
01:27:19,527 --> 01:27:21,450
You have no right!
(gavel pounding)

1254
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:22,750
- [George] Just calm down.

1255
01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:27,943
- I'm sorry, Judge.

1256
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:33,053
- Proceed, Mrs. Messenger.

1257
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:45,170
- On November 29, 1951,

1258
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:47,520
the authorities of the State of Florida

1259
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,920
removed from the house we
rented on the land we worked,

1260
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:53,570
Phyllis Messenger, then age 15...

1261
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:59,990
June Marie Messenger, then age 10...

1262
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,700
Annette Messenger, then age...

1263
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:21,970
I tried to teach my kids
that what a person is worth

1264
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:24,260
isn't just how much money they have,

1265
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,930
but what they believe in.

1266
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:29,083
And if they are truthful and fair.

1267
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:33,530
Maybe I wasn't always fair my own self.

1268
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:37,743
Maybe I dreamed for the wrong things.

1269
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:42,633
But now, you tell me since
when it's a crime to be poor.

1270
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:47,560
Is it a crime in this
country to go hungry?

1271
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:50,090
Is it a crime in this
country to have a house?

1272
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:52,430
Because that is what my
children have learned from you,

1273
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:55,800
and I have read the constitution
of the United States,

1274
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,193
and I have read the
Declaration of Independence.

1275
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:03,940
What if getting ahead isn't
just houses, and new cars,

1276
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:06,290
and more of everything
than the next one's got?

1277
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:10,240
What if it's bein' allowed to show

1278
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:12,090
your children how much you love them?

1279
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:17,140
And through bad times, and hard times...

1280
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:23,730
You continue to try to teach them about

1281
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:25,830
fairness and honesty...

1282
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,453
And what if that is getting ahead?

1283
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:33,933
We're not criminals, we're just poor.

1284
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:36,820
And we didn't pay a bill,

1285
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:38,720
and for that they took our girls away.

1286
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:43,500
But they're all we have.

1287
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,347
Maybe they're all we'll ever have.

1288
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:04,773
- [Judge] Mrs. Messenger,
I grant your petition.

1289
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,540
(slow instrumental music)

1290
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:26,173
- Girls...

1291
01:30:28,996 --> 01:30:29,829
It's me.

1292
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:32,803
It's your Momma.

1293
01:30:36,731 --> 01:30:37,564
- Momma?

1294
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:43,266
(sentimental instrumental music)

1295
01:30:55,704 --> 01:30:57,324
Papa...

1296
01:30:57,324 --> 01:30:58,157
Pa?

1297
01:31:00,569 --> 01:31:04,652
(sentimental instrumental music)

1298
01:31:22,761 --> 01:31:23,761
- Hi, Momma.

1299
01:31:28,686 --> 01:31:30,269
Where is everybody?

1300
01:31:31,934 --> 01:31:34,434
- At the house, waitin' on us.

1301
01:31:35,648 --> 01:31:40,460
(sentimental instrumental music)

1302
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:43,974
Merry Christmas, Phyllis, welcome home.

1303
01:31:43,974 --> 01:31:46,057
- Merry Christmas, Momma.

1304
01:31:48,033 --> 01:31:52,116
(sentimental instrumental music)

1305
01:31:54,587 --> 01:31:58,212
- Good to see ya', buddy.

1306
01:31:58,212 --> 01:32:00,658
(laughing)

1307
01:32:00,658 --> 01:32:02,741
- Merry Christmas, honey.

1308
01:32:03,592 --> 01:32:08,592
(slow instrumental music)
(laughing)

1309
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:30,423
