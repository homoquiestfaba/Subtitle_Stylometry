Neil, what do you get out ofhiring some goon to throwa pitcher of water in my face...

91
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:22,012
-while you hide...-It's not a pitcher.

92
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:23,947
while you werehiding in the bushes.

93
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:29,853
You are not sitting in front ofsome movie, you are acting outsome immature little game...

94
00:06:29,953 --> 00:06:33,257
if you want this to work,you'll have to grow up.

95
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,993
Or we could just break up.

96
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:37,995
What?

97
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:41,865

Here we are.

100
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:47,171
I don't believe this.

101
00:06:47,604 --> 00:06:50,607
The next thing you're gonnasay is, "It's not you, it's me".

102
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:51,975
No, it's definitely you.

103
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:57,715
See you're not enough likeKatharine Ross in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid .

104
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:00,951
I don't know what that means.

105
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:06,457
She was so supportive,she didn't make Paul Newmanfeel stupid.

106
00:07:06,757 --> 00:07:08,025
She went along with it.

107
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:12,196
Well, you know what, Neil?You can't go long with someonewho's going nowhere...

108
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:16,199
someone who runs a shitty littlevideo store that doesn't evenmake any money...

109
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,638
and spends his days hangingaround a bunch of dorks talkingabout the Seventh Seal.

110
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:23,474
No, hey, you likedthe Seventh Seal.

111
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,876
I was faking it, you sucker.

112
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:30,547
Oh, this is Burgman?

113
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:36,186
The imagery is so powerful!What a genius!

114
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:39,423
I'm so happyyou made me watch this.

115
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:41,825

[TV] You did a very good job yourself, you didn't need too much of my help.

136
00:08:52,262 --> 00:08:54,865
No, I don't mind.I'm in the video storeright now.

137
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:59,536
No, it's one of thoselittle shitty ones.

138
00:09:01,638 --> 00:09:04,141
[TV] Yeah, and wouldn't that break your heart?

139
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:10,681
What do you think aboutThe City of Lost Children ?

140
00:09:10,748 --> 00:09:14,918
Excellent film by the same guywho made Delicatessen .

141
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:17,187
I'm on the phone, actually.

142
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:25,929
What's Casino ?

143
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,866
To be honest,I wouldn't recommend it.

144
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:33,437
It's basically a poor man'sgood fellas bet in Vegas.

145
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:37,141
Hang on, I'm, I'm...still on the phone.

146
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:49,520
So which one should I rent?

147
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:00,931
So which one do you recommend?

148
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:09,506
[sighs][bangs]

149
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,341
All of a sudden, you're mute?

150
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:18,515
Oh, oh... I take it you'retalking to me now.

151
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:20,584
Who else would I be talking to?

152
00:10:20,718 --> 00:10:22,386
[chuckles]

153
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:25,756
It's for a friend who'sat home sick, which onedo you recommend?

154
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:27,591
What's the matterwith your friend?

155
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:28,759
Why?

156
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:33,163
If your friend's got stomach fluand he's running to thebathroom every five minutes...

157
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:34,631
then I'd go for this one.

158
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:37,534
But if your friend is in somekind of medication like...

159
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:39,503
You know what, just surprise me.

160
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:40,604
This one.

161
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:44,742
Great, uh...so how does this work?

162
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:46,410
What do you mean?

163
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,279
I've never been toone of these places.

164
00:10:49,513 --> 00:10:50,914
You never rented a movie?

165
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:52,883
I've been to a movie,does that count?

166
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:56,286
Okay, let's start you offwith a membership.

167
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:58,889
You know what, I knew it wassome kind of racket.

168
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:03,594
No, not really, you need togive me your driver's licenseand I'll give you a membership.

169
00:11:03,694 --> 00:11:05,362
I don't have a driver's license.

170
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:07,498
-How do you get around?-I get around.

171
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:12,403
Okay, well, I can't give youa membership until you giveme a driver's license.

172
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:15,072
Hmm, how about a cash deposit?

173
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:16,640
I'll give you 20 bucks.

174
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:19,877
-What? 20 bucks?-Yeah, 20 American Dollars.

175
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:24,515
You know, these are all typesyou kind of hard to...

176
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:29,186
Alright, I'll give you 50 bucksand I don't want to hearanything more about it.

177
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:30,854
Fifty it is.

178
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:33,657
Lucky for you,I saw my pimp today.

179
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:37,561
Oh, ah, Fletch, right?

180
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:40,664
No, his name is Donald.

181
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,103
Well, that's it.That's all I've got.

182
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:50,274
Don't blow it all oncigarettes and toilet wine.

183
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:51,642
[both chuckle]

184
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,011
-It'll be right here.-Alright.

185
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:55,179
Great.

186
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:03,887
[Neil whistling]

187
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:09,793
[commentator speaking]

188
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:16,900
[commentator continues speaking]

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,904
[people cheering in TV]

190
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:25,776
It makes no sense that zombieseat, they are dead, they haveno digestive system that works.

191
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:29,780
But they need people's brainsin order to continue to livein the undead world.

192
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,849
-Yes.-How come they never puke?

193
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:33,884
Their insides are full of puke.

194
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:36,854
I still don't understand whyzombies have to eat people.

195
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:39,123
why don't they justgo into restaurants?

196
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:41,392
-Absolutely.-It doesn't make sense.

197
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:42,693
They need to eat brains.

198
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,161
But they are already dead.

199
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:48,899
I understand them killing peopleripping them apart because theyare angry that they are dead.

200
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:50,000
[Neil] Hi!

201
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,703
-Hi.-Hi.

202
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:54,171
You like the movie?

203
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:56,840
Um... yeah.

204
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:58,275
Cool.

205
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:01,912
We made ithalf way through, huh?

206
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,849
Um... yeah.

207
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,019
-You want to see something cool?-Sure.

208
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:12,122
Watch this.Hey, guys, guys, here!

209
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:16,393
Hey.

210
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:20,898
Okay, okay.

211
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:25,703
She stopped it when Clancy isfollowing the professor.

212
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,908
My love, don't embarrassthe family. It's clearly,the race track scene.

213
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:35,879
Please, she obviously stoppedwhere the goons jump Clancyback at his apartment.

214
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:37,014
Hmm.

215
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:38,415
You're on crack.

216
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:42,152
This movie is stoppedat the scene in the night club.

217
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:45,622
Just as Baxter...depending on the tracking...

218
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:48,258
just when he confesseskilling the Gypsy.

219
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:49,760
That's crazy.

220
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:52,930
Why would anyone stop at justwhen he's about to confess?

221
00:13:53,664 --> 00:13:55,833
[laughing]

222
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,167
You're right.

223
00:13:57,234 --> 00:14:02,005
Precisely, hey, she wouldn't.She would be dying to knowwho killed the Gypsy.

224
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:04,708
Until I put it to you,ladies and gentleman...

225
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:08,712
that she fell asleep beforethe Gypsy was murdered.

226
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:11,582
And then she woke upin the nightclub scene...

227
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:17,454
and then not being able toappreciate the ironic tragedyof Baxter having to murder...

228
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:22,059
the only person who couldgot him out of the hook,she shut it off.

229
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,361
I don't know, put it in.

230
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,196
He seems a little...

231
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,799
[woman grunts]Let's see.

232
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:32,202
[TV playing]

233
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:37,007
[characters speaking]What's wrong with that?

234
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:41,845
- Will you cut that music out! - Cut out the rest of the fuss!

235
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:43,047
Why did you kill her?

236
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:46,917
[laughing and applauding]

237
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:55,659
Cool... but scary.

238
00:14:55,993 --> 00:14:58,829
Listen, I'm still gonna haveto charge you full price...

239
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:01,532
even though you onlywatched half the movie, sorry.

240
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:09,406
Uh... guys, did anyonetake an envelope fromunderneath the register...

241
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:13,610
written on itwas nothing at all?

242
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:17,147
You wrote the words,"nothing at all",on the envelope?

243
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:19,917
I don't evenunderstand the question.

244
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:21,418
[Marcia] Yeah, I'm confused.

245
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:22,653
-No?-No.

246
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:29,159
Looks like I have mislaidyour deposit.

247
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,028
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:35,833
This is where you offer me 50dollars' worth of movie rental.

249
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:37,167
It's a pretty good idea.

250
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:41,038
You know what, no offense,but I don't think I'm reallygonna use it.

251
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:45,909
You get a lot of goodmovies for 50 dollars.

252
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:49,780
Or you could just take me outto a 50-dollar dinner.

253
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,851
Oh.

254
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:56,687
Well, I could just use thecash as well, just the cash.

255
00:15:56,787 --> 00:15:59,323
No, no, no.

256
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:00,524
That's a great idea.

257
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:02,860
I can write it offas a business dinner.

258
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,461
[chuckles]

259
00:16:04,561 --> 00:16:07,197
Uh... tonight?

260
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:08,699
Sure.

261
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,734
Do you know a placecalled Lightsides?

262
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:12,069
-Hmm.-Alright.

263
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:13,871
I'll see you there at eight.

264
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:15,973
-Deal.-Cool.

265
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:22,279
-Uh, Violet.-Oh, Neil.

266

267
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:37,928
[woman laughing]

268
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:39,096
She asked me.

269
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:43,133
Hey, when your done fuckingthe customers, want to playTrivia Pursuit with us?

270
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:44,301

Uh, I'm only three minutes late.

277
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:16,293
We're on a business trip.

278
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:22,366
I gotta tell you though,it's a hell of a happy hour.

279
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:24,435
[tapping on the couch]

280
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:28,672
They got the best goddamnpeanuts in town.

281
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:33,977
-What?-Peanuts, P-E-A-nuts.

282
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:36,747
-Oh, alright.-Peanuts.

283
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:38,649
I guess you'vebeen here a while.

284
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:40,584
Okay, enough with the chitchat.

285
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:45,489
You gonna take me backto your place or what?

286
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:50,761
Uh, you know my car is rightoutside, I can give you a ride,or maybe I can call you a cab?

287
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:54,264
-What do you think?-You sure you don'twanna take me home?

288
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:57,167
-Hmm...-Neil, look at me...

289
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:01,438
-I'm wasted.-Yeah.

290
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:05,209
I mean, like shootinga fish in a barrel.

291
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:09,046
[Violet laughing]

292
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:16,687
Uh, you know, Violet?I think you are very attractive.Really, you're very attractive.

293
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:19,957
But come on, I mean, what kindof guy would I be if I...

294
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:23,560
take you homeand take advantage of you.

295
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:25,062
[Neil whispers] You know?

296
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:30,067
-So...-You're such a nice guy, Neil.

297
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:31,568
I'm gonna cry.

298
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:35,906
It's just really refreshingto meet such a decentperson these days.

299
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:37,207
Vodka and soda.

300
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:40,744
Um...

301
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:43,680
I'll have the screwdriver.

302
00:19:45,582 --> 00:19:48,152
I thought there'llalways be a market...

303
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:51,555
a group of customerswho needed somethinga little more personal...

304
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:53,157
and a little more intimate?

305
00:19:53,257 --> 00:19:54,324
Sure.

306
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:59,596
Plus, most of these big storesdon't have more than a few Altmovies, hardly any B movies...

307
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:02,466
Sci-fi, Neway, forget about it.

308
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:03,801
That's a bummer.

309
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:04,935
I know.

310
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:10,407
Plus, I find out there's gonnabe another Media Giant storeopening at least a mile away.

311
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:15,479
Did they send over a bunch ofguys in suits with cash in theirbriefcases try to buy you out?

312
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:20,150
No, I'm not really a threat,they don't need to buy me out.

313
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,587
-Goons with crowbars?-Um, no.

314
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:24,755
No?

315
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:27,124
No goons so far.

316
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:31,428
Um, I guess we've eaten almost50 dollars' worth of food?

317
00:20:31,662 --> 00:20:32,663
-Alright.-Ah...

318
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:35,799
Not so fast, big boy,you owe me a 50-dollar dinner.

319
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:39,970
I put my own tally in...

320
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:41,538
that'd be about...

321
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:45,376
[machine clicks]

322
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:46,643
about 37 bucks.

323
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:52,282
Um, I'll have a brownie Sundaeand a cup of coffee and...

324
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:56,053
right, a piece of key-lime pie.

325
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:04,628
So, what are we gonna doabout that big video store?

326
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:12,803
I mean, I assumed that everybodywould feel the same waythat I felt, you know?

327
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:15,339
But no, no, no, no.

328
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:20,210
Most people just want to get intheir cars, they want to driveto the local store and...

329
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,047
rent the latest disastermovie, you know?

330
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:29,119
Well, there's not many peoplejust wanna come in and havea leisurely stroll around...

331
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:33,323
maybe talk about cool break,shoot the shit... No!

332
00:21:34,024 --> 00:21:35,092
Sis.

00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:50,741
Um, which version of theInvasion of the Body Snatchers would you recommend...

335
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:54,978
the 1956 version,or the 1978 version?

336
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:58,849
We're closing in a few minutes.

337
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,236

Uh... so what's in your mind?

341
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,091
After he leaves, we'll go outand switch the DVDs so thatthey are all in the wrong boxes.

342
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:43,227
That could take all night.

343
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:47,164
It'll only a take a second tothrow a rock throughthe window, smart guy.

344

Alright.

348
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:15,626
Here you go.

00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,809
So we never really...got to talk aboutyou so much...

352
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:33,544
what is that you do?

353
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:36,914
Hmm, I'm looking forsomething I like.

354
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:39,950
Alright, what was your last job?

355
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,919
Doing a little this,a little that.

356
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:46,023
Uh-uh, and... what is it,you know, you want to do?

357
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:51,095
I don't know, have younever noticed how smalljobs get boring pretty quick?

358
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:53,030
Yeah, yeah.

359
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,201
I would totally hire you,you know, if you didn'tfuck up my inventory.

360
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:59,436
[Violet laughing]

361
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:04,074
Could I have a disc?

362
00:24:04,174 --> 00:24:05,409
[police car siren]

363
00:24:05,642 --> 00:24:06,744
Shh!

364
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:11,281
[siren continues]

365
00:24:16,854 --> 00:24:17,855
Good idea!

366
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:21,592
[screams]

367
00:24:24,895 --> 00:24:29,333
[alarm ringing]

368
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:51,021
[both gasping]

369
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:53,390
Oh my god, I thinkI'm having a heart attack.

370
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,659
My stomach.

371
00:24:56,727 --> 00:25:00,631
Silent alarm?I can afford a silent alarm,forget about it.

372
00:25:00,964 --> 00:25:02,699
Why did I eat all that dessert?

373
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:07,237
That was fun.

374
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:09,406
Yeah, it wasn't badfor a Tuesday.

375
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:15,212
Um, so, if we can get back tothe car, can I give you a lift?

376
00:25:15,612 --> 00:25:18,515
No, you go, I think we've got tosplit up for the night.

377
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:21,985
Well, what are you gonna do?

378
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:25,222
I'm just gonna lay low tillthe heat dies out, you know?

379
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:27,858
What?Just gonna hang in the yard?

380
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:31,628
I don't know, there's probablya Frisbee around here somewhere.

381
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:33,397
I'll be fine.

382
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:34,531
What are you doing?

383
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:39,002
Look at that, whole new guy.

384
00:25:40,003 --> 00:25:45,008
Just remember,if they catch you,deny everything.

385
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:46,143
Alright.

386
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:50,347
Oh, Neil, you certainly give mea lot to think about.

387
00:25:51,281 --> 00:25:53,484
I'll never rent fromthat video store again.

388
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:54,618
Tell me about it.

389
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:58,655
Not just because they almostcertainly have our picturebehind the counter...

390
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:06,730
-[Neil] Alright, well... why?-Ah!

391
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,201
[Violet] Hey, Neal.

392
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:16,273
Neal, psst, hey, you.

393
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:19,543
Yeah?

394
00:26:19,943 --> 00:26:22,713
[Violet whispers]We forgot the goodnight kiss.

395
00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:25,849
I mean, you know,if you wantedthe goodnight kiss.

396
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:28,886
Yeah, sure.

397
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:30,587
Um...

398
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:40,064
Hello?

399
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:42,266
Hello?

400
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,635
Hello?

401
00:26:48,872 --> 00:26:50,407
[kissing]

402
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:55,345
[Violet] Okay.I'll catch you later.

403
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,747
Okay.

404
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:18,769
Tell you what, man,that was the weirdestfirst date I'd ever had.

405
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:21,839
Yeah, sounds to me like thatchick's cookoo for coco puffs.

406
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:25,976
I mean, did she havea tendency to mutterthings loud to herself?

407
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:27,378
No.

408
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:29,480
Alright,then she's not schizophrenic.

409
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,549
Did she have wild mood swings?

410
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:37,488
No, she was prettyconsistently out there.

411
00:27:37,554 --> 00:27:39,390
Alright, then she's not bipolar.

412
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,659
Does she have an unusualtendency to count things?

413
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:47,231
Um, well, she did get a bitobsessed about the bill.

414
00:27:47,264 --> 00:27:51,535
Yeah, but I mean, did she touchthe bill a lot, touch a lotdoorknobs, OCD style?

415
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:53,003
No.

416
00:27:53,103 --> 00:27:55,739
Are we gonna play this game,or you just list off...

417
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,209
every diagnosis just to showme how much you knowabout psychology?

418
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:01,178
I'm pretty surethe girl isn't crazy?

419
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:04,281
Yeah, okay.You're gonna go outwith her again?

420
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:09,086
I don't know, I don't havea number and I don't knowwhere she lives.

421
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,456
You gotta Google her ass.That's what you gotta do.

422
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:14,691
-I don't know her last name.-[man] Hello?

423
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:17,961
-Oh, customer, I got it.-Alright, thanks, man.

424
00:28:18,295 --> 00:28:19,463
Sorry.

425
00:28:41,785 --> 00:28:42,986
-Hey.-Hey.

426
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:45,856
I went inside to look for you,but you weren't there.

427
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:48,158
The store was totally empty,it was creepy.

428
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:51,028
I thought maybe you're havingthose promotional deals...

429
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:54,298
like you are in a special postapocalyptic movies or something.

430
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:56,333
Nah, I was just passing time.

431
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,501
-Yeah?-Yeah.

432
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:03,607
Nice. Hey, do you knowhow to "dunk slam" it?

433
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:07,044
Yeah, I've been knownto "dunk slam" in my day.

434
00:29:07,144 --> 00:29:09,113
Ah, nice steal.

435
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:11,248
I want to learn how to do it.

436
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:13,584
Okay, first of all,it's called a "slam dunk".

437
00:29:14,318 --> 00:29:15,319
Yeah?

438
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:16,487
Wow![wall bangs]

439
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:18,689
You hear that?

440
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:23,360
You gotta take these things inbaby steps, today, you'll learnthat it's called a slam...

441
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,495
Oh shit!

442
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:27,431
-dunk.-This one'sfor all the marvels...

443
00:29:27,531 --> 00:29:32,736
the world finals.Five, four, three, two, one!

444
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,105
Yes!

445
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:39,243
God's will! God's will!

446
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:45,449
Well, the ball has to be in theair when the clock runs out...

447
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:50,154
you count down the clock,and then you jump,so the game's over.

448
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:54,758
I'm pretty sure it's the player,as long as the player's in theair when the time runs out.

449
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:55,993
Uh, no, it's the ball.

450
00:29:56,026 --> 00:29:57,728
I'm pretty sure it's the player.

451
00:29:57,828 --> 00:29:59,229
It's the ball.

452
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,132
Um, but you can comedown now if you want.

453
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:04,835
No, you come up here.

454
00:30:05,402 --> 00:30:06,704
It's nice, you'll like it.

455
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:08,439
Aren't your hands killing you?

456
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:10,741
Yeah.

457
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:13,477
Wanna go pool hopping?

458
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:15,612
Uh, no.

459
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:21,652
[laughs]

460
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:27,591
You carry binoculars?

461
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:31,228
Oh, yeah, you'll be surprisedhow often these babiescome in handy.

462
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:36,199
People are doing all sorts ofnasty things in privacyof their homes.

463
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:39,303
Seems unfair we shouldn'tget a peek at it, right?

464
00:30:42,506 --> 00:30:46,710
Looks like the manager issaying they still can't findanything missing.

465
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:51,548
And the cop is saying maybethey are just some kidshaving some fun.

466
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:56,153
And the manager's saying thatfrom the security tape theydon't look like kids.

467
00:30:56,253 --> 00:30:58,889
Although the female cooperatorseems quite fetching.

468
00:30:58,989 --> 00:31:02,126
I suppose she could pass as acollege student in a TV show.

469
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:08,565
And the cop is like, "yeah,she was quite beautiful in aunique and fascinating way...

470
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:12,202
almost like the sunriseon a misty morning".

471
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:18,876
Is this how most people getcaught coming back to the scene?

472
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:24,515
I have an idea, let's goto my store and watch a movie.

473
00:31:24,615 --> 00:31:28,452
Oh, always with the movies...that's the differencebetween you and me...

474
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:32,556
I like you, Neil, but clearlyyou sit around and you'recontent to just watch...

475
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:34,691
and me, I have tobe doing something.

476
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:39,329
I'm perfectly aware right nowwhat I'm doing is sittingaround watching...

477
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,532
so don't botherpointing out the irony.

478
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:42,599
Huh-huh.

479
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:47,671
Don't get me wrong,last night was veryvery exciting...

480
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:51,542
and I guess this isexciting too...

481
00:31:52,976 --> 00:31:57,481
and given that we're definitelygonna get busted sitting here,but...

482
00:31:59,516 --> 00:32:00,584
can we just go?

483
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:03,253
Hmm, okay.

484
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,256
So where did you grow up?

485
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:10,427
Alaska, and Stockholmand Cape Town,but mostly Tasmania.

486
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:14,865
-Wow, that sounds incredibly...-Exciting?

487
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:17,000
I was just gonna say made up?

488
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:19,436
So where did you go to school?

489
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:21,271
A mystery schoolfor young women.

490
00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:23,407
[chuckles]

491
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,842
Hmm, that sounds hot.

492
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:26,543
Oh, yeah.

493
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:31,615
We all wore baby doll pyjamasand we had pillow fightsevery night.

494
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:38,589
And when Ms. Stern caught us,She doused us all with baby oil.

495
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,024
Terrific.

496
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:43,494
Terrific.

497
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:47,731
-So do you live around here?-No.

498
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:50,868
-Oh.-What?

499
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:54,938
Did you think we're going backto my place?

500
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:58,475
Slow down, Casanova.

501
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:04,314
No, I was just hoping to getsome confirmation that youactually live around here.

502
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:08,786
I can't shake off the feelingthat you're just blowing throughthe town like a carnival.

503
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:14,458
Well, I can't give my addressout to anybody, I'm sureyou'll understand.

504
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,261
Huh-huh.

505
00:33:18,362 --> 00:33:19,430
Well.

506
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:23,033
I gotta go do some stuff.

507
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:27,805
OK, well, thanks for stopping bymaybe you'll stop by again.

508
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:28,906
Nah.

509
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:35,979
Actually, I'm ready to giveyou my phone number.

510
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:37,815
Cool.

511
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:41,018
I want you to be very carefulwith this number, Neil.

512
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:45,122
Sure, I'll memorize the numberAnd eat the paper,how does that sound?

513
00:33:45,222 --> 00:33:47,691
I wouldn't recommend it.It's scented note paper.

514
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:50,360
you'd be better offflushing it down to the toilet.

515
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:53,597
Okay, I wasn't actually gonna dothat, but sure, I'll flush it.

516
00:33:53,697 --> 00:33:54,832
You are a sweet heart.

517
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,814
[Lucien] Neil, what're you gonnado when this place goes tits up?

518
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,052
[Neil] I don't think it's gonnahappen for a few years...

519
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:20,557
not until people can getany movie they want to,directly in a TV set...

520
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:21,725
and I'm dead meat.

521
00:34:21,825 --> 00:34:23,327
You should go back to school.

522
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,964
I mean, look at me.I have absolutely noconcept of the real world.

523
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:28,132
Hmm.

524
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,168
I think you need to find a wayto supplement your business.

525
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:33,704
You gotta turn this placeinto a single's club.

526
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:36,774
People come in here, they tellyou their favorite movies...

527
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:40,144
and you match them upwith the perfect mateusing that information.

528
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,645
Yeah, that's a great idea.

529
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:43,480
You can charge woman 100 bucks.

530
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,984
And no matter what theytell you, you just give themmy phone number.

531
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:49,686
If I set you up with someonewho likes Ben Affleck...

532
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,588
you'd throw her outof a moving car.

533
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:53,724
I don't know. Is she cute?

534
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:56,693
[John] Alright, this iswhat you gotta do?

535
00:34:56,794 --> 00:35:01,231
You gotta turn this place intoa late night underground casino.Make some cash!

536
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,168
Lots of towns have thesesecret gambling clubs...

537
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,170
places making like50 grand a night.

538
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,773
Right, but if it's a secret,how do people know to come?

539
00:35:09,873 --> 00:35:11,675
Uh, good question.

540
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:14,745
You let it leak outthrough word of mouth.

541
00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:18,182
Well, then it's not a secretanymore and thenyou get busted.

542
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:23,654
That's why you have secretpassword, something likeice station zebra or rosebud.

543
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:27,224
No, no, no.You can't say rosebud,you'll ruin citizen Kane.

544
00:35:27,324 --> 00:35:31,662
No, you don't, the only wayyou ruin citizen Kane is youtell people rose bud is a sled.

545
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:33,397
Rosebud is a sled?

546
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:37,401
Yes, it's a sled,it's the last shot out of...what film school do you go to?

547
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:40,204
How do you let people knowwhat the secret password is?

548
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,773
You let it leak outwhat the password is.

549
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:44,375
-It's a secret.-Yeah.

550
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,610
Then it's not a secret,then you get busted.

551
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,146
-He's right.-I think you're over-analyzing.

552
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:52,316
-You can't have a secret...-I know you're over-analyzing.

553
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:57,554
Excuse me, excuse me,I'm looking for Neil Louis,the guy who owns this place.

554
00:35:58,155 --> 00:35:59,790
-That's him.-That's the guy.

555
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,024
That's me.

556
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,794

557
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:06,497
We were wondering if we couldhave a word with you.

558
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,664
Oh, sure.

559
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,933
Um, you want tocome into my office?

560
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,606
-[Neil] Guys, can youhold down the fort?-Yeah.

561
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:19,676
You see that?

562
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,980
And you thought we don't livein a totalitarian society.

563
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:26,817
All you have to do is evenmention opening upa secret gambling joint...

564
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:28,118
the cops crack down.

565
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:29,153
Shut up.

566
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,923

This is good, you can settlean argument for us.

642
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,815
It's not really an argument.

643
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:53,717

00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:38,796
A baby wouldn't stare at the sunany more then it would holdhis breath and drop dead.

00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,097
Thank you.

657

732
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:48,425
Plenty of food, Emerson!

733
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,462
This is nice, I'm so gladyou can join us.

734
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:53,597
Wow, you made food.

735
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:54,965
Let's see what we've got.

736
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:59,903
Now I wish I could sayI made all of this, but...

737
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,438
[laughs]

738
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,173
What are you up to?

739
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,410
Now this, I did make.

740
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:10,647
Oh my god, I love this.I have tried to make thisa couple of times...

741
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:12,516
and it always just sucks.

742
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,717
It's true.

743
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,986
Did you put LSD in the jello?

744
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,555
Oh my god, how did you know?

745
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,893
Believe it or not,the secret ingredient is salt.

746
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:24,294
-Really?-Hmm-hmm.

747
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,630
I know it sounds gross,but it's true.

748
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:31,235
Not surprising, because there'sactually a lot of dessertrecipes that call for salt.

749
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:32,536
-Really?-It's true.

750
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,505
It's amazing.

751
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:37,808
So you guys start...

752
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,413
I'm actually gonna goand feed the ducks.

753
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,581
[Marcia] Okay.

754
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,450
You are going away?

755
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,856
-I love her.-Yeah.

756
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:54,124
[Buddy] She's a keeper.

757
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:55,893
-Yeah.-[Marcia] And she's pretty.

758
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,294
-Yeah.-She is a hell cat.

759
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:58,529

760
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,197
Hi, there.

761
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:01,432
-Hello.-Hi.

762
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:03,267
Beautiful day, isn't it?

763
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:04,601
Yeah, it really is.

764
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:06,870
Oh, no.

765
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:09,973
Um... how come you guysare eating our food?

766
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,384
So what was the bet?

767
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:23,687
If the bucks won,I could shove a burritoin your face.

768
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:27,758
The last time you lost,I was supposed to get topiss on your foot.

769
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,159
I never did.

770
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:30,728
What are you waiting for?

771
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:32,830
You want to piss on my foot,be my guest.

772
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,064
-Hey, Neil.-Yeah.

773
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:36,300
You want to see mepiss on his foot?

774
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,769
Sure, yeah,just not in the store.

775
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,538
-Take your sneaker off.-Wait slow down.

776
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:45,309
Now listen, why don't we godouble or nothing ontonight's game?

777
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,344
I don't understandwhat I get if I win?

778
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:49,513
How do I double uppissing on your foot?

779
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,315
Both feet.

780
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:54,685
Oh, shit,I forgot about the game.

781
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,687
I'm supposed togo to Violet's tonight.

782
00:50:57,488 --> 00:50:59,723
What? The pranksterdoesn't let you watch TV?

783
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:05,162
It's not that. It's just shelikes to act stuff out,like a scene I guess.

784
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,198
She couldn't bemore perfect for you.

785
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:09,366
You think so, right?

786
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,935
Too bad, man, it's gonnabe a great game.

787
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:13,604
I know, shit.

788
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:16,707
Are your friends mad at me?

789
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,376
No, they thought it was cute.

790
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:24,014
Um, so where isthe cat lady tonight?

791
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:27,217
I don't know,sometimes she goes out.

792
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:31,121
I think she's balling that guythat picks up aluminium cans.

793
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:32,289
Hmm.

794
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,592
Do you think we should goand check on the cats?

795
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,197
Not especially.

796
00:51:40,898 --> 00:51:43,200
It's been dark over therefor a few hours now.

797
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,136
I think we should goand check on them.

798
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:50,474
What's your angle?

799
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:51,642
Why?

800
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:58,682
[commentator speaking on TV]

801
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,218
[Neil cheers]Yes!

802
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,786
[table bangs]Yes!

803
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:05,989
Sorry.

804
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,493
Wow, that was the first coolthing that happened all night.

805
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,562
Come on, that was amazing.

806
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:18,302
Wait, are you pissed becauseI want to watch the game?

807
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:23,941
No, I just don't get it, if youlike basketball, we could be outplaying basketball right now.

808
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:28,479
We could be sneaking intoa high school gym, playingbasketball by candle light.

809
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:30,280
Yeah, no.

810
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,584
But sometimes,it's nice to do something...

811
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:39,256
that's fun notscrewy and weird.

812
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:41,725
You know?

813
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,096
[Violet sighs]

814
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:03,113
Whenever I'm in a cemeteryI tried to look for the graveof somebody...

815
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:04,748
who died the day I was born.

816
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:10,387
And then you steala headstone and dumped iton someone's doorstep.

817
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:13,357
No, just to gives yousomething to think about.

818
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:20,998
That guy is here,now he's gone and I'm here.I'm taking his place, you know?

819
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:25,169
Would he want me to sit aroundwatching TV all day?

820
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:26,336
No.

821
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:30,274
He would want me to run around,all sorts of shit.

822
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:37,548
Is this why you feel the need togo out and cause trouble?

823
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:42,953
I have a condition.

824
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:47,491
It's called bore-phobia.

825
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:48,692
Bore-phobia?

826
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,431
Bore-phobia.

827
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,303
I see, you'reallergic to boredom.

828
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:02,673
A very exoticand misunderstood disorder.

829
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:07,544
So you can understandwhy doctors are reluctant todiagnose it.

830
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:15,919
Hey look, you know, I...

831
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:17,421
I hear what you are saying.

832
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:22,626
And I wish I could bemore totally reckless,and I'm trying.

833
00:54:23,394 --> 00:54:29,333
I mean, if you wannago nude hang-gliding,I'll go nude hang-gliding.

834
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,135
Really?Because I know this guy.

835
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:33,604
-Not right now.-It's a guy...

836
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:34,838
But I could call him.

837
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,542
Not right now,just let me finish.

838
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:46,917
I want to those things, but justin a little more not insane way.

839
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:49,853
So I'll go nude hang-gliding...

840
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,956
but I just don't want togo to bed and then wake up...

841
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:56,460
and find myself in a hang-gliderwith no clothes on.

842
00:54:58,195 --> 00:54:59,363
Are you okay with that?

843
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:01,999
I understand.

844
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,202
Good.

845
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:10,641
You want tocome back to my place?

846
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,713
I don't think so.

847
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,317
-Are you upset with me?-No, not at all.

848
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:26,156
It's just you got in my head nowyou are getting on your clothesinto a hang glider without...

849
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:29,626
waking up, it's justmy wheels are spinning.

850
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:34,131
I just don't think you reallywant me to be in bed withyou tonight.

851
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:35,232
Right.

852
00:55:35,733 --> 00:55:36,800
Fair enough.

00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:19,143
-Hey.-Hey.

856
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:22,713
-A good crowd.-Yeah, it's a reallygood band tonight.

857
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:27,051
We've got the singerand the keyboard player fromthe American Sex Club.

858
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:30,821
They also get the guitarsand bass player fromthe Mustache Rides.

859
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:35,359
Plus, tonight they got thedrummer from Tard sitting in,so should be pretty bad-ass.

860
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:37,461
You lost me, dude.

861
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:42,966
Okay, look, the drummer isnormally in a band called Tard,tonight he is not, alright?

862
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:45,102
Alright, ...-Yeah, you go check it out.

863
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:47,604
It's probably better that way,learn from doing.

864
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:16,300
Neil, see you later.

865
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,769
So she likes musicians, huh?

866

Thank you and good night.

869
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,153
That was great.

870
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:19,022
Of course it was great, baby.

871
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:21,325
Why don't you get me a beer?

872
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:26,263
[Neil coughing][Violet laughing]

873
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:34,638
So, you do thiskind of thing much?

874
00:59:34,972 --> 00:59:38,375
Balling guitar players?I don't usuallygo for musicians.

875
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:40,277
Really?

876
00:59:42,646 --> 00:59:44,548
Why did you thinkthat I did, Neil?

877
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:49,620
Uh, I heardthat chicks dig musicians.

878
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,623
No, magicians,we go nuts for magicians.

879
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:55,592
Get the wax out of your ears.

880
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,694
Oh?

881
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:05,202
So you never dated a musiciannot even that guy that I saw youwith at Baltimore Jacks?

882
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:09,206
I always know when youare spying on me.

883
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:12,242
I get a little warm spot on theback of my neck right here.

884
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:13,911
That was for my benefit?

885
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:15,979
[laughing]

886
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,614
You're a sicko.

887
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:21,351
Maybe, but I managed tobring out a rock star in you.

888
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:30,594
I've dated a few musiciansbut I swore off.

889
01:00:30,694 --> 01:00:32,029
Really, why is that?

890
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:37,167
Well, first, there wasGarry Leathers.[illegible]

891
01:00:43,374 --> 01:00:45,509
[Neil] At least he hada great stage name.

892
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:47,244
Except that wasn't a stage name.

893
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:50,614
Garry Leather's just a givenname, stage name wasRandy Cocks.

894
01:00:50,714 --> 01:00:52,950
[laughs]Nice.

895
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,952
And then there wasRick Niamacus.

896
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:59,623
Rick's all the ambition in lifewas play the entire guitarssolo from hot for teacher.

897
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:04,361
[guitar playing]

898
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:08,632
Once in a day,he did it.

899
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:11,602
After more than ten years,he finally nailed it.

900
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:18,342
And after filling his ambitionin life, there is really onlyone thing left for him to do...

901
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:21,145
[screaming]

902
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,919
[Violet] Oh god! Oh my god!

903
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,422
-Wow.-Hmm.

904
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,958
And that put you offfor musicians forever.

905
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:36,493
No, but you would think so.

906
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:39,296
Finally there was Garth Bodka.

907
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:43,400
Gigantic bald,musical prodigy from Poland.

908
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:46,970
See I thoughtRock and Roll was a problem...

909
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:50,874
but this classically trainedgargantuan was ten timesworse than the rest.

910
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:54,211
[Neil] Hmm, and how did that go?

911
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:59,049
[Violet] Hmm, he's been chasingme all over the countryfor the last three years.

912
01:01:59,483 --> 01:02:02,586
I move to another city,he follows me and breaksdown my door.

913
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:07,691
I move to somewhere else,he tracks me down again,breaks down my door again.

914
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,794
I'm tired, I'm gonna go to bed.Good night.

915
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:02,212
-Here you go.-I'll take this.

916
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:03,847
-Yeah?-Yeah, I'll take this.

917
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,149
Okay.

918
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:12,256
Steve Jackson.

919
01:03:13,657 --> 01:03:17,094
It's a nice generic nameyou've got there, Steve.

920
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:19,063
I guess.

921
01:03:21,065 --> 01:03:22,433
Interesting accent.

922
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:23,967
Where's the accent from?

923
01:03:24,768 --> 01:03:26,704
-Wyoming.-Right.

924
01:03:29,673 --> 01:03:31,842
You catch the gamelast night, Steve?

925
01:03:33,077 --> 01:03:36,313
I think Lakers are gonnawin it all again this year.

926
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:39,116
Just like they did last year.

927
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:40,784
Yeah.

928
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:43,787
Lakers didn't win the championlast year, Steve.

929
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:51,428
Can I just get my card please?

930
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:14,184
[Neil sighs]

931
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:19,356
Remember when you werewondering why we don't havemany customers?

932
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:23,794
[movie playing]

933
01:04:23,794 --> 01:04:27,564
[man laughing]

934
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:32,036
[laughing continues]

935
01:04:32,136 --> 01:04:33,904
That's him.That's the guy.

936
01:04:34,772 --> 01:04:36,206
What are you talking about?

937
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:43,647
Alright, knock it off!You crazy fucking polark!

938
01:04:43,781 --> 01:04:48,819
[audience applauding]

939
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:50,487
I got my eye on you, alright?

940
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:54,658
You ever set foot anywherenear Violet, I will personallyshit down your throat.

941
01:04:54,758 --> 01:04:55,826
You got it?

942
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:03,767
What was that?

943
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:08,205
Oh, oh man.

944
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:14,511
Violet, she's playing thesetricks on me, she tries toget inside of my mind...

945
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:18,348
She thinks it's funny, so shetells me this guy after her...

946
01:05:18,449 --> 01:05:20,651
this bald guy, ex-boyfriend.

947
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:22,152
Shh!

948
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,488
Try to watch the movie.

949
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,359
You're the polark.

950
01:05:34,965 --> 01:05:36,199
You're Polish?

951
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:40,971
Jerry Lucy is gonnamake a salad.

952
01:05:44,074 --> 01:05:45,175

953
01:05:45,843 --> 01:05:46,977

955

[Violet screams]

962
01:06:12,336 --> 01:06:13,504
Jesus, Violet.

963
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,706
[screams]

964
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:16,940
This is bullshit.

965
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:18,075
[screams]

966
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:22,046
[screaming continues]

967
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:26,250
Come on now.I get it.

968
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:34,858

969
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:37,528
Fuck, fuck.

[Neil screams]

972
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,340
You said no onewas gonna get hurt.

973
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:26,910
What was in your jacket?

974
01:07:33,784 --> 01:07:35,786
God, Neil,you and your video tapes.

975
01:07:42,593 --> 01:07:45,863

-Nice to meet you.-Nice to meet you too.

978
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:01,712
Denis.

979
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:07,584
Pa-pa.

980
01:08:07,618 --> 01:08:08,919
[chuckles]

981
01:08:19,897 --> 01:08:23,701
You know every time I see youI feel I'm in one of thosehidden camera shows?

982
01:08:24,668 --> 01:08:27,137
It's not so bad, people lovethose shows, right?

983
01:08:27,237 --> 01:08:29,907
No. I don't love those shows.I hate those shows.

984
01:08:31,241 --> 01:08:33,644
I mean what wasI supposed to do tonight, huh?

985
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:35,746
What was supposed to happen?

986
01:08:35,846 --> 01:08:37,781
I don't know!Whatever you want to do.

987
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:41,552
You are the guy who sitsaround all day watchingthis kind of shit on TV.

988
01:08:41,652 --> 01:08:43,053
What does the guy on TV do?

989
01:08:43,153 --> 01:08:47,224
What do you mean watch thiskind of shit? How do you knowwhat I am watching?

990
01:08:48,826 --> 01:08:50,828
Oh my god, do you spy on me?

991
01:08:51,428 --> 01:08:52,629
Da.

992
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:53,731
[chuckles]

993
01:08:53,831 --> 01:08:55,966
-That is crazy!-Why?

994
01:08:55,999 --> 01:08:58,769
Come on, you can't seehow crazy that is?

995
01:08:58,836 --> 01:09:03,707
There is not one guy in theworld would go out with a girlwho spies on him.

996
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:06,610
But we're not going out,we're getting toknow each other.

997
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:08,445
We're finding outabout each other.

998
01:09:08,512 --> 01:09:13,150
Frankly, there's no better wayto know somebody than to catchthem in their unguarded moments.

999
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:16,487
Everybody can say all the rightthings on those first few dates.

1000
01:09:16,587 --> 01:09:19,590
I find that's an effective wayto cut through the bullshit.

1001
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:23,527
And you followed mejust the other day.

1002
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:25,396
-Well...-Uh-huh.

1003
01:09:26,397 --> 01:09:28,198
Yes, I followed.

1004
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:33,570
Look, you were being cagey,you were practically beggingme to follow you home.

1005
01:09:33,904 --> 01:09:37,775
I'm not one of those insecuregirls who runs around spyingon a boyfriend...

1006
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:40,944
because she thinks hemay be cheating on him.That is just sad.

1007
01:09:41,045 --> 01:09:42,913
No, you definitelyproject confidence.

1008
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:44,515
Yeah, yeah.

1009
01:09:44,615 --> 01:09:46,417
I happen to thinkI'm a real catch...

1010
01:09:46,517 --> 01:09:49,253
so why shouldn't I be thoroughabout who I go out with?

1011
01:09:49,887 --> 01:09:54,258
Yes, so I watched youand I find out you area very decent person.

1012
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:57,294
You are.

1013
01:09:58,996 --> 01:10:04,334
So if it's the spyingthat bothers you, I promiseto put down my binoculars.

1014
01:10:05,002 --> 01:10:08,038
Unless you want to gobird-watching in whichI would gladly do.

1015
01:10:08,105 --> 01:10:10,574
Even though it soundskind of boring.

1016
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:18,582
Um...

1017
01:10:25,856 --> 01:10:31,562
No, I'm sorry,I can't... I can't...

1018
01:10:35,933 --> 01:10:38,502
[door bangs]

1019
01:10:48,512 --> 01:10:49,913
Oh, man.

1020
01:10:54,918 --> 01:11:00,491
[Lucien] I still say that Koreansnuff cartoons are much betterthan Japanese death-match anime.

1021
01:11:00,557 --> 01:11:02,860
[John] I say the Japanesedeath-match anime...

1022
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,629
is much, much betterthan Korean snuff cartoons.

1023
01:11:06,163 --> 01:11:11,402
I still say that Korean snuffcartoons are much better thanJapanese death-match anime.

1024
01:11:11,435 --> 01:11:12,503
You're crazy!

1025
01:11:12,736 --> 01:11:16,407
Japanese death-match animeis so much better thanKorean snuff cartoons.

1026
01:11:16,507 --> 01:11:17,574
You're crazy!

1027
01:11:17,574 --> 01:11:23,547
-Korean snuff cartoons...-Shut up! Shut up!Shut up! Shut up!

1028
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:26,517
Excuse me, you guys have anyJapanese death-match anime?

1029
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:30,554
Yes, but we can't talk about it,because our boss broke upwith his girlfriend.

1030
01:11:32,189 --> 01:11:34,224
I think I'm gonna leaveyou guys alone.

1031
01:11:35,526 --> 01:11:36,627
Hey.

1032
01:11:38,662 --> 01:11:42,833
Have you ever seen anyKorean snuff cartoons?

1033
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:45,169
-No.-Yeah, nobody has. It's garbage.

1034
01:11:50,841 --> 01:11:52,910
-Hi Neil!-Hi.

1035
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:55,379

-Good, you look good.-I know, thank you.

1037
01:11:57,881 --> 01:11:59,483
-You do too.-Thanks

1038
01:11:59,717 --> 01:12:02,386
It's so funny I was justthinking about you.

1039
01:12:02,486 --> 01:12:03,787
-Is that a fact?-Yeah.

1040
01:12:03,887 --> 01:12:05,289
-Hey, you.-Oh, hey.

01:12:19,403 --> 01:12:25,943
First of all, it wasn't a bucketand I was just trying to observefrom a distance her reaction...

1048
01:12:30,581 --> 01:12:31,915
Sounds like a perv to me.

1049
01:12:33,684 --> 01:12:34,752
That's cool.

1050
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:39,590
So you were just hangingin the bushes and jerking offlike some pathetic peeping tom?

1051
01:12:40,324 --> 01:12:42,526
We should definitelyget together some time.

1052
01:13:05,616 --> 01:13:08,018
[Lucien] Last but not least,there's a letter...

1053
01:13:08,752 --> 01:13:12,189
from a place calledMovie Dork Videoin San Clement.

1054
01:13:12,189 --> 01:13:14,691
This guy is going underand he needs to liquidate.

1055
01:13:14,792 --> 01:13:17,161
So he wants 3000 bucks.

1056
01:13:17,961 --> 01:13:22,466
And if we buy everything for3000 bucks, he'll give usfree shipping, which is great...

1057
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:28,138
but obviously, there's a lot ofcrap here we don't need, like8 copies of Ernest Ghosts camp.

1058
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:31,375
But he does have some stuffthat we don't have.

1059
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:36,547
So we could just take everythingand save on the shipping,which is not a bad idea...

1060
01:13:36,647 --> 01:13:39,516
or we can cherry-pickand...

Hey, let's put in a movie.

1066
01:13:59,069 --> 01:14:00,504
No, no more movies.

1067
01:14:00,704 --> 01:14:03,807
It's no use, it's notenough anymore, you know?

1068

1070
01:14:12,049 --> 01:14:13,550

1072
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:23,460
And I'm gonna sign the thingand hand it right back to himand he's gonna get in his truck.

1073
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,895
He's gonna drive off.

Because I really like you.

1231
01:26:12,102 --> 01:26:14,605
-Give me a break.-No, I'm crazy about you.

1232
01:26:14,705 --> 01:26:16,340
I believethe first half of that.

just one year before you startedto look at your girlfriend likeshe's an old comfortable shoe.

01:26:39,663 --> 01:26:44,301
Does it make me crazy, becauseI never want you to look at melike an old comfortable shoe.

1241
01:26:44,401 --> 01:26:50,407
You're the sweetest,most interesting,most creative guy I've ever met.

1242
01:26:52,976 --> 01:26:55,579
But you're fundamentallyscrewed up, I mean...

1243
01:26:56,647 --> 01:27:00,117
you've spent half ofyour life hanging outwith fictional characters...

1244
01:27:00,217 --> 01:27:01,919
and what woman canlive up to that?

1245
01:27:03,253 --> 01:27:04,321
Oh.

1246
01:27:06,123 --> 01:27:08,292
And I shouldpoint out, Neil, that...

1247
01:27:10,694 --> 01:27:15,532
it takes two to tango, I mean,if you are not the most gullibleson of a bitch I've ever met...

1248
01:27:15,632 --> 01:27:18,235
I wouldn't feel obligedto do these things to you.

1249
01:27:19,236 --> 01:27:23,006

1252
01:27:33,817 --> 01:27:36,353

1253
01:27:36,587 --> 01:27:38,155
How can people live like this?

1254
01:27:40,257 --> 01:27:43,761

1257
01:27:58,042 --> 01:28:02,112
It's either spending your lifewondering whether I'm goingto steal your liver...

1258
01:28:03,213 --> 01:28:06,617
or try to find a womanyou'll never take for granted,you choose.

1259
01:28:09,186 --> 01:28:11,288

1261
01:28:24,768 --> 01:28:25,936

Ha-ha, you... you spent all thatmoney on a car?

1269
01:28:57,401 --> 01:29:01,105
You think I want to walkaround the rest of my lifelooking like a schmuck?

1270
01:29:01,238 --> 01:29:02,406
Well, I like it.

1271
01:29:03,207 --> 01:29:04,475
