1
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:21,597
<i>I have a friend,
a jazz musician, trumpet player.</i>

2
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:24,262
<i>Really terrific. And I go
and hear him jam every month or so.</i>

3
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:27,796
<i>And he plays this piece I love :
an old Chet Baker song.</i>

4
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:32,174
<i>And he blows the same notes every time,
but every time it sounds different.</i>

5
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:36,238
<i>And we had drinks one night,
when I used to drink...</i>

6
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:38,784
<i>and I tried to tell him
how that song made me feel...</i>

7
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:43,050
how the music made me feel
and how his playing made me feel.

8
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:46,092
And he just kept shakin'
his head, and he said...

9
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,150
"Joan, you can't talk about music.

10
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:52,096
Talking about music is like
dancing about architecture."

11
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:54,861
I just said, "Well, gonna
get all philosophical on me.

12
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:56,869
It's just as pointless as
talking about a lot of things.

13
00:00:56,937 --> 00:00:58,871
Love, for instance."

14
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:02,705
And my friend laughed, and he said,
"Definitely. Most definitely.

15
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:06,473
Talking about love is
like dancing about architecture."

16
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:11,949
So I don't know.
He might be right.

17
00:01:12,018 --> 00:01:14,179
But it ain't gonna stop me
from trying.

18
00:01:28,268 --> 00:01:33,900
<i>Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me</i>

19
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:41,981
<i>Woke up again this mornin'
with the sun in my eyes</i>

20
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:45,017
<i>We might change
the movie script Surprise</i>

21
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:47,815
<i>A Mafioso story with a twist</i>

22
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:49,947
<i>Two more films
You know, you are a hit</i>

23
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:53,151
<i>You get your ass out there</i>

24
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:55,558
<i>All right</i>

25
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:58,223
<i>Feeling nothing</i>

26
00:01:58,298 --> 00:02:00,823
<i>Absolutely nothing that day</i>

27
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:06,533
<i>And I say what the hell
am I doing drinking in L.A.</i>

28
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:09,302
<i>How can you sit there</i>

29
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,639
I'm alone, and I want
to keep it that way.

30
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,304
I lost my wife and son.

31
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,145
- Well, ask the bartender.
He can find anything.
- No.

32
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:52,014
They're dead.

33
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:57,415
Do you wanna talk about it ?

34
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,847
<i>Any guys here taking this Viagra ?
Let's see.

35
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:30,981
<i>Not one honest guy.

36
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:33,787
<i>Have you... Okay ?

37
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,626
<i>You know, you have to be... A friend of mine
dropped one of these Viagra pills on the floor...

38
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:40,427
<i>and his dog swallowed it.

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,025
<i>Now he has a pointer.
Anyway...

40
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:49,067
- We have to talk about this.
- I know. You're right.

41
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:54,075
But do you really think
we can save this marriage...

42
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:57,139
now that I've decided I like Leno
better than Letterman ?

43
00:03:57,217 --> 00:04:00,550
Don't. I'm sorry.

44
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,555
I remember when my jokes
used to make you laugh.

45
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:05,557
They do. I just...

46
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,723
- We have to talk about this.
- There's nothing to talk about.

47
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,861
Oh, of course there is.

48
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,872
But I don't want to.

49
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,344
Okay.

50
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:30,249
What about the party ?

51
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,911
Well, nothing's changed.
I have a brain tumor...

52
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:35,716
but I'm going to that party,
with or without you.

53
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:38,314
We've put a deposit down.

54
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:42,060
Mission accomplished.

55
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:46,657
I am in love.

56
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,890
In love ?

57
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:50,903
Yes, in love.

58
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:54,407
But before we go further,
let me say this.

59
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:58,171
Before we go...
further...

60
00:04:59,244 --> 00:05:02,613
I can't go any further.

61
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:06,448
It's almost 1:00, Meredith. 1:00.

62
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,455
- And I got a day job, remember ?
- Yeah. Phil needs his sleep.
He's a postal worker.

63
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:12,718
All right, slackers.
Trot off home.

64
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:16,091
Good night.

65
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:19,029
- Settle a bet I have with Phillip ?
- Yeah.

66
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:22,296
He claims you have
no personal life whatsoever.

67
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:24,496
I say that's impossible.

68
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:27,165
I hope it wasn't a large bet.

69
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,141
On equity waiver salary
you can't afford to lose much.

70
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,144
No Mr. Right ?

71
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,713
Ms. Right ?

72
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:39,377
No inclination for either at the moment.
Thank you very much.

73
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:43,149
But if you're fishing,
"mister" is my gender of choice.

74
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:46,624
You're a wonderful person.
You should have someone in your life.

75
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:48,627
That's all I'm saying.

76
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:53,359
I can still be a wonderful person
and not have anybody in my life.

77
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:56,425
Look, I'm just not interested
in a relationship right now.

78
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:58,437
You are such a liar.

79
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:02,704
I am such a liar.

81
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:16,288
Hold that, please !

82
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:25,130
Did she not say, "Hold that, please" ?
Or isn't English your first language ?

83
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:40,512
Any trouble getting away ?

84
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,810
He has his acting class tonight.

85
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:46,545
- You want me to get champagne ?
- I don't think I have time for that.

86
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:51,481
In case you're planning on
being gentle tonight...

87
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:54,323
don't be.

88
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:41,807
Mom ?

89
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:46,568
Welcome to Chicago.

90
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:51,545
You look awful.

91
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:55,418
- You should get some sleep.
- I'll sleep when you sleep.

92
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,791
It happened three days ago.

93
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:10,097
The last time I talked with her...
my wife Leann...

94
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,398
It was about 3:00.

95
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:17,466
She was taking our son Jamey
to... soccer practice.

96
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:24,182
I had a meeting at a bar.

97
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,584
I'd had a few drinks. No more than
usual... standard four-drink buzz.

98
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:30,589
Maybe five.

99
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:37,160
After, I was gonna meet Leann
and Jamey at the Pizza Hut.

100
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:41,492
Every Tuesday night
Jamey wants Pizza Hut.

101
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:45,636
So I was late.

102
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:48,105
I was driving fast.

103
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:51,803
Not too fast, I think.

104
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:56,281
The light, it just turned.

105
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:00,185
It was red for only a second.

106
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:02,278
Less than. I swear.

107
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:06,825
I ran the light.

108
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:11,889
I saw the car.

109
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:14,593
I hit my wife's car.

110
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,601
Oh, my God.

111
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:20,605
I saw her face through the windshield
just as I hit them.

112
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:26,101
She saw me.

113
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:28,841
She knew it was me.

115
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:35,344
You shouldn't be alone.

116
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:38,748
Yes, I should.

117
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:41,316
I should be alone in hell.

118
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:43,328
That's where I am.

119
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:20,589
Twenty minutes at 350 degrees
is absolutely essential.

120
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,692
No more, no less.

121
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:26,398
And the delicacy of this fish
is best appreciated by its taste...

122
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:29,703
not necessarily
by its appearance.

123
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:31,801
Once you remove the fish
from the oven...

124
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:37,078
transfer it directly
onto a heated plate.

125
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,324
There's one thing that's paramount for
every cook to keep in the back of their mind.

126
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,097
Only you know
what goes on in the kitchen.

127
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,606
Join me next week :
Hannah's Country Kitchen Cooking.

128
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:04,743
And we're clear.

129
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:09,305
Hannah, that was incredible !
I smell a fourth Emmy.

130
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:15,485
I don't wanna see any more
of these. Hmm ?

131
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:17,819
Tough. Oh, I...

132
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,291
Mmm. It's delicious.
What ?

133
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:23,761
Nothing.

134
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:31,426
You can never stop, can you ?

135
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:35,167
- Stop what ?
- Organizing things.

136
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:38,699
- Oh, I'll stop if it bothers you.
- No.

137
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:41,770
It doesn't bother me.
It takes me back.

138
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,215
Sit next to me.

139
00:11:58,564 --> 00:12:00,998
It's a hell of a way
for you to find out, huh ?

140
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:04,161
- Find out what ?
- Well, that I'm gay, for one.

141
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,530
Come on.
You never suspected ?

142
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:12,510
- You were always so good at sports.
- Mom !

143
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:17,038
I'm really glad you're here.

144
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:21,850
- And what's the second thing ?
- What second thing ?

145
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:26,187
You said it was a hell of a way for me to
find out that you were gay for "one" thing.

146
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:28,693
- So what's the second thing ?
- That I'm dying.

147
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:32,561
- Don't say that !
- Oh, stop ! I can't go back into
our classic mother-son pattern.

148
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:37,729
Okay ? I can't play the Iverson family
game of denying reality...

149
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:40,398
- where reality is over there, somewhere...
- Oh, honey, don't.

150
00:12:40,473 --> 00:12:43,772
and we hide from it over here
and pretend it doesn't exist.

151
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:47,677
Okay ? It takes too much energy.
Energy that I don't have.

152
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,942
All right. Maybe I don't either...
have the energy.

153
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:52,007
God, that would be good.

154
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,553
All right, we'll start fresh.

155
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,554
Pattern-free.

156
00:12:56,622 --> 00:13:00,786
Within these four walls,
reality will prevail.

157
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,159
And if I slip up,
you... you let me know.

158
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,130
You'll...
You'll be the first.

159
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:13,535
They say first steps
are the hardest.

160
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:22,639
The doctor said
you haven't had any visitors.

161
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:27,516
You know me, Mom. I've never been
one to have a lot of friends.

162
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:31,580
Besides, I seem to be
the last of my small crowd.

163
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,716
What about your roommate Jack ?

164
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:40,260
He wasn't my roommate, Mother,
and he died a year ago.

165
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:47,106
Hey, how's the commercial going ?

166
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:49,107
It's on hold for a week.

167
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:53,737
The geniuses at Pacific Motors
have now decided to spotlight the car...

168
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:55,747
and dumb down the concept.

169
00:13:55,815 --> 00:14:00,479
- No Fellini ?
- Who ? Most definitely no Fellini.

170
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:03,215
But my play's not falling apart.

171
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:05,314
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

172
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:07,484
Bosco, where do you keep
Theater Week ?

173
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,587
Top shelf. Between Psychology Today
and Martha Stewart Living.

175
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:19,396
Jesus ! Meredith ?

176
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:22,464
Jimmy, grab that side ! Grab that side.
Okay. Everyone. All right, fellas.

177
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:26,137
On three. One...
Oh. Okay. All right.

178
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:28,874
- Can we say "lawsuit" ?
- Uh, are you okay ?

179
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:31,974
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine.
I landed on a stack of George.

180
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:35,145
- Plenty of padding.
- Meet the architect.

181
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:39,351
- Are you sure you're okay ?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

182
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:42,917
- If I can just find one,
Theater Week is on me.
- And dinner is on me.

183
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:46,954
- No, no. Not necessary. Truly.
- Please. I insist.
It's the least I can do. I mean...

184
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:50,400
- Look, I'm not gonna sue you, okay ?
- I didn't think you were gonna sue me.

185
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:55,636
Not that I couldn't, mind you.
But something tells me...

186
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,973
that you'd be able to convince
the jury that this was my fault.

187
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:03,846
You know I'm not just asking you to dinner
as a preemptive strike against litigation.

188
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,407
- I'm asking because...
- I'll have dinner with you.

189
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:11,318
- What changed your mind ?
- Anybody who can say "preemptive strike...

190
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,484
against litigation" with a straight
face deserves a dinner companion.

191
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,393
Thank you.

192
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:20,088
This is last week's.

193
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:23,930
I'm thinking of putting
the show on hiatus.

194
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:26,597
And I'm thinking
you'll do no such thing.

195
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:32,008
- But, Paul...
- No. I don't want anything
to be any different.

196
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,809
- Things are different.
- I don't want to have a fight with you.

197
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:39,078
I don't want a fight. I just...
I just want to talk and make...

198
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:43,485
Look. What about what I want ?
You've always controlled everything :

199
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:45,547
your shows, the kids.

200
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,355
Stop trying to control me.

201
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:50,418
I'm not trying
to control anybody.

202
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:53,294
- I just think maybe...
- Don't think.

203
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:57,166
Let us just proceed as if
nothing has changed. All right ?

204
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:05,435
- I don't know if I can do that.
- You have no choice.

205
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:10,611
I may have just enough time left
to become an alcoholic.

206
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,045
I don't care who had her first. I poke
around her stool looking for worms.

207
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,179
I feed the fucking thing.
I take her to the vet.

208
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:52,383
All you do is pet her twice a day.

209
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,359
Which is a hell of a lot more
than you've been doing to me lately.

210
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:57,589
Okay, let's discuss this calmly.

211
00:16:57,663 --> 00:17:01,429
We're adults.
We've been together a long time.

212
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,866
Well, not a long time,
but an adequate four months.

213
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:07,804
Adequate until you fuckin' cheated on me
with that skag from Bloomingdale's !

214
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:09,807
You fu...
Harry ?

215
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:13,538
Don't you dare hang up.
Harry ! Harry ?

216
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:17,305
Shit ! Shit.

217
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:27,251
Hi. You got a quarter ?

218
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:33,798
Thank you.

219
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:41,205
The fucking cat is mine.

220
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,173
No, no.
On this I'm not negotiable, Harry.

221
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:48,179
Harry. Hey ! Hey !
Don't be a fuckin' infant, okay ?

222
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:52,206
You can take anything that came from IKEA.
I want the cat, and I want Pottery Barn.

223
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,718
It...
One more time.

224
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:57,688
You hang up
one more time and I...

225
00:17:57,757 --> 00:17:59,691
Damn it.

226
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:05,923
- It's my last one.
- Negotiations are almost over.

227
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,901
Thank you.

228
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,473
All right. Okay, scumbag.
You're robbing me blind...

229
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:21,343
but I will give up Pottery Barn
if I can just have the cat.

230
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:26,215
No! No. Pottery Barn does not
include Williams Sonoma.

231
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:29,482
They're two separate
establishments, Harry.

232
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:31,989
Oh, Christ on crutches !
Okay, you know what, Harry ?

233
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:36,016
I want to get rid of you as much as I
want to get rid of that junk from IKEA.

234
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:38,529
So here's the thing.

235
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:42,590
You can walk away with Pottery Barn,
Williams Sonoma, IKEA.

236
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:47,537
And just to show you that I'm
a grown-up, I will throw in all
the crap from Hold Everything !

237
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,404
Yeah ! Yeah, that includes
the hanging shoe sorter.

238
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:54,344
That's right.
Do we have a deal ? Great.

239
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:57,507
So here's the thing.
I will be home in two hours.

240
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,916
You and all your junk
from the catalogs will be gone...

241
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:03,614
and the cat will be there waiting
for me, purring contentedly.

242
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:11,756
Well, the least I can do
after taking your last quarter
is let you buy me a drink.

243
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,636
I work in the Twin Towers.
Entertainment law.

244
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:32,148
- And you ?
- Me ?

245
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:34,345
I'm not very good company.
I'm... I'm sorry.

246
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:38,656
No problem.

247
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:45,322
- I'm not gonna bother you.
- Don't go. I'm sorry.

248
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:48,332
- No, I'm sorry. Really.
- Again, I'm sorry.

249
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:53,902
- You've had a bad day.
- A killer.

250
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:58,239
You know, yesterday I would have said
that things couldn't possibly get any worse.

251
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,744
They sure as hell got
worse today.

252
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:06,148
I'm...
I work in the... Twin Towers too.

253
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:09,710
I'm a development executive
over at ABC.

254
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:13,554
I'm responsible for all those shit shows
that you don't watch on Thursday night.

255
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:15,992
You're to blame for those ?

256
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:18,327
Afraid so.

257
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:20,431
Everybody blames me.

258
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:24,458
My boss, my wife, my secretary.

259
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:26,471
Hell, even my kids.
They watch NBC.

260
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:30,270
And I work like a dog...

261
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:34,039
trying to find some way to fix
the Thursday night schedule.

262
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,680
Well, I don't find a way to fix
the Thursday night schedule...

263
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,880
and my boss,
today he tells me...

264
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:46,857
that coming into the office
tomorrow isn't necessary.

265
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:51,659
Or coming in ever again,
for that matter.

266
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:56,991
I wish you could spend
the night.

267
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,003
You know I can't.

268
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:02,566
- Is this all you want from us ?
- Roger...

269
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:06,168
and I mean this really sweetly,
there isn't any us.

270
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:10,045
- Mmm. There's only this.
- Well, this could be different.

271
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:12,242
Well, anything can be different.

272
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:14,479
But I don't want this to be.

273
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:19,422
I want it to be what it is : two very
sexually compatible people enjoying each other...

274
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:22,892
with no obligations,
no complications...

275
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:25,260
no individual history,
no mutual history...

276
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:27,765
and no guilt.

277
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,324
- That's awfully cold.
- It's awfully realistic.

278
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:33,428
- I know you don't love your husband.
- Oh, but I know...

279
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:36,133
that you do love your wife.

280
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:43,480
I'll have a vodka martini,
very dry and straight up...

281
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:48,577
- with three olives,
and my sullen friend here will have...
- A Coke.

282
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:52,283
The poster boy for designated drivers
will have a Coke.

283
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,222
- The guy on the phone ?
- Harry.

284
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,787
Harry, right.
We were together for five months.

285
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:02,425
- I thought it was four.
- You were paying attention.

286
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:04,765
Everyone in this club
was paying attention.

287
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:07,271
We were together for five months.
But I knew it wasn't gonna work out...

288
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:10,900
'cause the first time he comes over
I find out that he sits down to pee.

289
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:14,434
- You don't do that, do you ?
- No.

290
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:16,481
So fuckin' lazy.
And in my experience...

291
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:20,177
it extends to other aspects
of an individual's personality.

292
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:25,087
Last time I saw him, Harry was wearing
a blue sweater and an idiotic expression.

293
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:27,557
The sweater was new.

294
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:29,787
Here's to good riddance Harry.

295
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:32,797
Good riddance Harry.

296
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:44,974
Hey, again please.

297
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:48,207
And drier this time,
and three olives, not two.

298
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,714
Three.
Nutritional value.

299
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:52,774
Now, where were we ?
Oh, so Harry.

300
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:55,183
Right.

301
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:57,313
The sex part wasn't bad.

302
00:22:57,389 --> 00:22:59,323
You know, for a while.

303
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:04,488
And then his consummate laziness
and lack of imagination
became tediously self-evident.

304
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:09,557
Every time, everything was
exactly the same as the time previous.

305
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:13,935
It was as if he had followed
some step-by-step instructional video.

306
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:17,498
And about two weeks ago,
guess what I found in the apartment.

307
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:22,570
- A step-by-step instructional video.
- Right ! Here's the topper.

308
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:25,708
I timed his performance
one night. Right ?

309
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:29,151
And then I checked the running time
on the video. And guess what.

310
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:31,815
- To the minute.
- Right down to it.

311
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,824
Twenty-three minutes,
to be exact.

312
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:35,826
Including credits.

313
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:40,456
Anyway, he's history.

314
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:43,626
- But I still have Blanche.
- Who would be the cat.

315
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:46,193
Oh, a great cat.
Very feline.

316
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:48,364
The best cats are.

317
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,001
Blanche can look at you with a gaze
of unflappable superiority...

318
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:56,480
that seems to spring from near total
detachment and disinterest.

319
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,680
Not unlike
how you're looking at me now.

320
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,824
Thank you.

321
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:11,491
You don't say very much,
do you ?

322
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:15,499
- Does anyone, when they're with you ?
- Don't get mean.

323
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:21,597
We don't know each other well enough
yet. When we do, then you can get mean.

324
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,774
So we should do this again sometime.

325
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:30,303
- We're not doing anything.
- Okay. Then let's not do this.

326
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:33,010
Let's do something else.

327
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:35,383
I'll even let you be the man.
You can decide where we go on our date.

328
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:40,456
I don't date.

329
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:44,292
Well. Gee, I don't have
a witty comeback for that one.

330
00:24:44,363 --> 00:24:46,627
I mean, I'm used to
any number of brush-offs...

331
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:49,166
but that's... that's a new one.

332
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:52,203
Doesn't date.

333
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:55,729
I'll admit I've seen you around. You're
always... You're always dancing alone.

334
00:24:57,576 --> 00:25:00,409
- That's the way I like it.
- Why is that ?

335
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:05,011
I don't want to be
rude or unkind...

336
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,517
or... mean.

337
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:13,087
But I just don't come out with my entire
life story over martinis and a Coke.

338
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:19,229
I'm sorry, really.

339
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:21,823
Your cat's lucky to have you.

340
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:33,344
My wife had moved them out.

341
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:36,210
Moved everything out.
Left a note.

342
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:38,613
Very thoughtful.
Didn't realize she felt that way.

343
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:40,515
What way ?

344
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:46,791
That I was a failure.

345
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:50,659
Not only professionally,
but personally as well.

346
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:54,563
Just like ABC no longer required
my services. She let me know...

347
00:25:54,633 --> 00:26:00,071
that she and the kids no longer
required my services or my presence.

348
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:04,234
It turns out she's been
seeing some guy for a year...

349
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:07,437
for a fucking year,
and I never suspected a thing.

350
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:09,810
- And you know what the worst of it is ?
- What ?

351
00:26:09,882 --> 00:26:12,680
The guy that she left me for ?
The fucker works for NBC !

352
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:16,187
He's got my wife and my kids,
my cat and my dog...

353
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:20,021
and he doesn't have to lose any sleep over
the Thursday night fucking schedule !

354
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,630
Honey ?

355
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:34,570
You should come to bed.
What are you working on so late ?

356
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,972
I was just checking on
your TV residuals.

357
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:39,442
They're still robbing us blind.

358
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:42,605
I happen to know you're
a tremendous hit on WWFU.

359
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,376
Which is where ?

360
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:46,610
Intercourse, Pennsylvania.

361
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:49,210
Oh, Intercourse.

362
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:51,756
And they can't get enough
of you in Intercourse.

363
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:53,757
And I know exactly how they feel.

364
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:57,424
Bed.

365
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:02,595
Come on, Molly.
Come on, Crackers.

367
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:18,478
- Cheers.
- I've been meaning to ask you
about your wedding ring.

368
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:24,955
It's really just force
of habit. I...

369
00:27:25,023 --> 00:27:29,255
divorced...
four chilling years ago.

370
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:33,059
- Acrimonious ?
- No.

371
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:36,328
Oh, wait, that means
hostile and bitter. Yes.

372
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:40,269
In the divorce papers she referred to me
as the "architect of her misfortune."

373
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:45,002
- Ouch.
- Yeah. No kids, luckily.

374
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:49,673
I wanted them, but she didn't.

375
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:51,682
- You know, if this makes you uncomfortable...
- No.

376
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,082
- I can take it off, the ring.
It's not a problem.
- No, no. Stop.

377
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:58,612
Don't be silly.
That would be two of us being silly.

378
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,717
I really only wear it to keep
the construction guys from harassing me.

379
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:06,692
Does it work ?

380
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:09,825
Depends on what I'm wearing.

381
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:16,432
I think you can tell
that I'm not very good at this.

382
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:22,342
You're charming.

383
00:28:23,582 --> 00:28:27,313
And real.

384
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:29,854
Lovely.

385
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:32,219
What did I say ?

386
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,349
Nothing.

387
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:36,417
No, no. Nothing.

388
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:39,589
I just...

389
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:44,795
Before I came here tonight,
I was discussing you with my sister.

390
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,362
We were coming up with
a psychological profile.

391
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,374
Several, actually.

392
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:54,310
- And which did I fit into ?
- Oh, none.

393
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:57,576
I think I'm gonna have to
revise the filing system.

394
00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:01,608
Put you in the
"too good to be true" category.

395
00:29:01,686 --> 00:29:05,622
Mmm.
But not to worry.

396
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,523
I just know you'll turn out
to be involved with somebody else...

397
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:12,120
or... gay or crazy.

398
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:19,370
Well, it's a definite possibility.

399
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,074
Crazy, huh ?

400
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:27,177
Certifiable.

401
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:32,983
Mom.

402
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:36,979
I know you've spoken to my doctor.

403
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:40,183
I know. I know he told you
I don't have long...

404
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:42,726
so let's not pretend
that I do, okay ?

405
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:46,797
Want to watch another movie ?

406
00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:49,425
No. God, no.

407
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:54,861
I tell you what I would like,
is I'd like to play a game.

408
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:00,071
- Should I get a deck of cards ?
- No. Not that kind of game.

409
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:03,979
- What ?
- I want each of us to take some time...

410
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:08,247
and think of something that we have
always wanted to tell the other.

411
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:12,017
Something private, some secret...

412
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,490
some feeling or memory.

413
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,120
It could be anything.
Just as long as it's truthful.

414
00:30:18,196 --> 00:30:21,495
I don't know if I'd be good
at that kind of game.

415
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:23,466
Will you try for me ?

416
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:45,487
I'm waiting.

417
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:50,594
I never loved your father.

418
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:52,596
Not for a minute.

419
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:57,264
Wow. You're good at this.

420
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:04,267
- Why did you marry him ?
- Oh.

421
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:06,367
I was pushing 30.

422
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:10,312
Back then we called that
a last chance for happiness.

423
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:13,874
He had a good business.
I remember my mother saying, "Marry him.

424
00:31:13,952 --> 00:31:16,045
He's an undertaker
and will never be out of work.

425
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:18,021
People will always..."

426
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:21,959
People will always die.

427
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:27,631
People will always die.

428
00:31:35,874 --> 00:31:38,934
I hope it's okay for me
to say this, but...

429
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,377
you strike me
as someone who's been...

430
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:44,847
burned romantically.

431
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:48,611
Scalded.

432
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:51,383
Repeatedly.

433
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:54,687
Married ?

434
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:58,024
- Divorced ?
- Yes.

435
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:00,223
But that was a long time ago...

436
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:02,562
and, believe it or not,
one of my better experiences.

437
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:04,568
Let me guess.

438
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:07,799
He was either involved
with somebody else...

439
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:09,999
or gay...

440
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:12,009
or crazy.

441
00:32:12,077 --> 00:32:14,011
Actually, yes.

442
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:18,409
Involved with someone else ?

443
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:22,214
- Crazy ?
- No. He was gay.

444
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:24,551
- Wow. Really ?
- Yeah.

445
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:27,353
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- No.

446
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:29,620
I mean, I'm not sorry.
I mean...

447
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:34,021
- Save me.
- It's okay.

448
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:36,659
He was a great guy.

449
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:40,694
I married the boy next door.
Literally. We were 19.

450
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:43,741
It didn't last very long.
Couldn't, of course.

451
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:49,174
I haven't seen him in a long time,
but... but we're still friends.

452
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:53,547
Which is more than I can say for the
parade of total losers that followed.

453
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:58,214
Are there any...
recent or current losers ?

454
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,281
No.

455
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:04,385
I've been in a holding pattern
where romance is concerned.

456
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:07,989
- Well, things can change quickly.
- Yeah.

457
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,664
I'm sorry.

458
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,801
This is... going
a little too quickly for me.

459
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:23,680
I can go slow.

460
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,783
Look, Trent,
you're a nice guy. I...

461
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:30,947
- Aw ! Aw. That's... You know ?
- What ?

462
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:33,456
- I'm swimming ashore.
You can call the Coast Guard.
- Oh, come on.

463
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:35,925
"Nice guy" ? That's...

464
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:40,363
I haven't been dismissed
with that since high school.

465
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:42,923
Does that mean no second date ?

466
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:45,333
I have a hard time trusting men.

467
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:49,237
I'm not men.
I'm not a group. Just me.

468
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:52,875
Who probably has
a lot of women after him.

469
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:56,141
- So ?
- So...

470
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:58,808
Look, you know,
you seem to want honesty...

471
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:00,817
so I'll be honest with you.

472
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:03,046
I don't really have
a problem getting dates.

473
00:34:03,121 --> 00:34:06,648
But I'm 38 years old.
I don't just want dates anymore.

474
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:09,193
I'll tell you what I don't want.

475
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,627
I don't want all of
this calculated artificiality.

476
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:17,794
This isn't me, Trent... this dress, the stupid
little bows in my hair. And look at you.

477
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:21,862
I mean, I don't imagine you sit around
your house in an Armani suit. Do you ?

478
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,341
No. My house is black-tie.

479
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:34,341
- Look, I'm sorry, but...
- I know, you have to go.

480
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:37,786
- I'm already... Jesus... two hours late.
- You're leavin' me too.

481
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:40,654
It's okay. Really.
Just go. Go.

482
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:44,889
- Until the day I die, I'll remember that story.
- Yeah, listen. Listen.

483
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:49,059
You have been swell,
listening to me like this.

484
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:53,662
Bet you'll think twice about striking up
a conversation in this bar again, huh ?

485
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:56,104
Take care. All right ?

486
00:34:56,174 --> 00:34:58,642
- For once I really, really mean that.
- Yeah.

487
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,076
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

488
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:08,819
Taxi money.

489
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:11,355
Don't even think of allowing
that guy to drive.

490
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:14,119
I'm a lawyer.
I'll hunt you down.

491
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,963
Look, Trent...

492
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:26,333
if by some miracle,
after this explosion of neuroses...

493
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,804
you still want to see me,
we can start from the top.

494
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:31,307
You can cook dinner for me Tuesday.

495
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:34,978
- Okay.
- Good.

496
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:38,615
- Tuesday.
- Yeah.

497
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:41,846
- You can come to my apartment.
- Okay.

498
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,083
Meet my better half.

499
00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:49,559
- Better half ?
- Yeah. My dog. Barley.

500
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:52,357
Your dog Barley ? That'd be great.
I'd love to meet Barley.

501
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,364
- Good.
- I'll bring the wine.

502
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:56,559
- Great.
- Good.

503
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:59,228
- Tuesday night.
- Absolutely.

504
00:35:59,304 --> 00:36:03,070
You know, Meredith,
those stupid little bows ?

505
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:06,076
I think they're adorable.

506
00:37:23,988 --> 00:37:26,957
Why did you stay with him ?

507
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:30,290
Well, you.

508
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:34,525
I guess I was the last generation
of women who actually did that.

509
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:38,365
It never even occurred to me
to get a divorce.

510
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:42,463
I was so relieved when he died.

511
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:47,876
- Don't hold anything back, Mom.
- Mmm.

512
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:51,905
Ah, I like this
new spirit of frankness.

513
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:54,543
It's oddly cleansing.

514
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:08,058
I want to know what you're like
away from me here.

515
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:12,296
That can't happen. The fact that you and
I aren't involved beyond this room...

516
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,702
is what... ahh... appeals to me.

517
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:18,765
You know how to play
your role damn well.

518
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:21,539
Guilty as charged.

519
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:34,554
- Roger, what do you want ?
- I don't want much.

520
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:37,754
I just want more of you.

521
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:41,731
I can't give you that.

522
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:47,964
Roger.
Don't be an anger ball.

523
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,973
"An anger ball" ?

524
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:54,977
Don't you see ?
What's great about you and me...

525
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:59,881
right here, this very moment, is that we don't
come through that door with a lot of baggage.

526
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:03,717
We don't come through that door
with any baggage at all.

527
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:07,747
And aren't we lucky ?
We don't bring anything in...

528
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:11,124
and we don't take anything out.

529
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:29,474
You're not the only one
who can dance alone.

530
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:33,483
- What ?
- I said you look like
a man in need of a Coke.

531
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:46,493
My friend here will have a Coke,
and I'll have a...

532
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:50,261
Vodka martini,
very dry, three olives.

533
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:52,268
Good memory.

534
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:55,499
My mind has an endless capacity
for useless information.

535
00:39:58,009 --> 00:40:00,671
I've had a terrible day.

536
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:04,112
I know we were talking about you for
a moment there, but my day was so bad.

537
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:06,650
"How bad was it ?" you might ask.

538
00:40:06,718 --> 00:40:09,744
- I might if you gave me the opportunity.
- I was saving you the effort...

539
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:12,756
so that after I tell you my tale of woe
we can move on to happier topics.

540
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:16,590
Perhaps one of your choosing. Anyway,
I'm an actress. Did I tell you that ?

541
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:21,030
- No. But I'm not surprised.
- I had this monologue in class today.

542
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:24,762
And I was prepared.
You know, I mean, like really prepared.

543
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:27,168
You know Suddenly Last Summer
by Tennessee Williams ?

544
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:30,867
- No.
- Oh, it's one of my favorites.
Great story.

545
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:33,638
It's about this girl, Katherine...
moi...

546
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:37,442
who is slated for a lobotomy
because the mother of her cousin
wants to keep her mouth shut...

547
00:40:37,515 --> 00:40:40,916
about certain goings-on involving
the old lady's son Sebastian.

548
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:45,115
You see, the women sort of pimp for
Cousin Sebastian. Are you following this ?

549
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:46,986
- Amazingly, yes.
- Anyway, it turns out...

550
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:51,154
on their travels together Cousin
Sebastian liked to troll the beaches...

551
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:55,689
looking for young native boys
in order to satisfy his base instincts.

552
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:58,497
One hot afternoon in Cartagena...

553
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:02,232
the boys decide they have had quite
enough of Sebastian's shenanigans...

554
00:41:02,306 --> 00:41:05,742
and they...
well, they eat him.

555
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,337
- You mean metaphorically.
- No. They really eat him.

556
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:14,077
They devour him.
In short, he's lunch.

557
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:17,019
And Katherine witnesses
every course...

558
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:19,420
from soup to nuts.

559
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,720
If you'll pardon the expression.

560
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:25,320
Anyway, I'm about to do
this killer monologue. I'm up next...

561
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:28,957
If one more actor saunters
into this class...

562
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:33,834
and recites Katherine's "native boys
ate my cousin Sebastian" speech...

563
00:41:33,905 --> 00:41:36,100
from Suddenly Last Summer...

564
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:39,041
I am going to puke.

565
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,477
Now, who is up next ?

566
00:41:43,815 --> 00:41:47,808
Um... Joan ! You're on.

567
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:52,950
The teacher didn't lose
his lunch. I did.

568
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:56,789
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

569
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:03,828
Now, on to happier topics, I promise.
How about a movie ?

570
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:05,732
- I told you.
- I know.

571
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:08,636
I know. You don't date.
Is it a religious thing ?

572
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:12,767
- No.
- Well, you like movies, don't you ?

573
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:14,778
- They're okay.
- How about tomorrow night ?

574
00:42:14,846 --> 00:42:17,644
It doesn't have to be a date.
We'll meet at the theater.

575
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,979
- I don't know.
- Look. I'll make it easy.
Okay, blue boy ?

576
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:26,888
Tomorrow night I'm going to the
late show of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre
at the Sunset Five.

577
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:29,893
If you decide you would like to
join the human race, meet me there.

578
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:39,700
Now, in other news, they found
a cure for cancer. Okay... moving on.

579
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,898
- No, they...
- Do you ever hear from Wendy ?

580
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:46,569
What on Earth
made you think of Wendy ?

581
00:42:46,644 --> 00:42:51,240
- Oh, I don't know.
Just thinking about the old days.
- Yes.

582
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:53,715
Very old. Ancient.

583
00:42:55,353 --> 00:43:00,154
Well, do you ?
Do you ever hear from her ?

584
00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:02,158
Any reason I should ?

585
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:05,753
Any reason you should keep
her picture in your desk ?

586
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:12,865
None that you should
concern yourself with.

587
00:43:12,937 --> 00:43:17,567
Viagra. Oh, God.

588
00:43:17,642 --> 00:43:21,510
Viagra. That's what everyone's
talking about. Are you on it yet ?

589
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:23,740
Just the men. Okay, well...

590
00:43:23,814 --> 00:43:26,044
it's so successful,
you know, of course...

591
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:38,361
- Hey. I made it.
- Hi.

592
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:42,559
- Uh, casually attired.
- Wow.

593
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:45,067
Yeah, I know. The flowers are
a little much, and I'm late.

594
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:47,263
But only because I had second thoughts
about the flowers...

595
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:50,364
and I threw them away halfway down the
block, and then I had third thoughts...

596
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:52,466
and went back and got them.

597
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:54,807
Well, I'm glad you did.

598
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:57,177
Thank you.

599
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:59,182
Come in.
Come in, come in, come in.

600
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,380
- Thanks.
- I... I hope you like Italian.

601
00:44:03,454 --> 00:44:05,649
- I hope you like merlot.
- I do.

602
00:44:05,723 --> 00:44:07,748
Wow ! That's a...

603
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:09,759
- Barley.
- That's some dog ! That's...

604
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:13,058
- Barley, get down, sweetie. Come on.
- Whoa.

605
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,758
- My family has a thing for pets.
- Yeah. Oh.

606
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:18,301
That's...
That's certainly impressive.

607
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:22,897
Suddenly I'm feeling
a little inadequate. That's...

608
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:26,603
I... It's almost ready.
I...

609
00:44:26,677 --> 00:44:31,341
Sorry that took me so long. I was
on the phone with one of my sisters.

610
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:36,177
- The married one.
- The one who's having an affair ?

611
00:44:36,253 --> 00:44:38,483
Yeah, well, the one
who's always having an affair.

612
00:44:38,556 --> 00:44:40,820
Her husband doesn't
suspect anything ?

613
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:44,520
Her husband is sweet,
but he's a bit dim.

614
00:44:46,063 --> 00:44:48,657
He doesn't have
much of an imagination.

615
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:51,668
Chandler girls like their men
with imagination ?

616
00:44:51,736 --> 00:44:54,034
Yeah. It helps.

617
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:59,639
You know, I'm told
I have a good imagination.

618
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:03,840
I don't want
to have sex tonight.

619
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:10,884
- Okay.
- I mean if that's why you thought
I invited you over here...

620
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:13,082
- I invited myself over here.
- Well, whatever.

621
00:45:13,157 --> 00:45:16,149
- I mean, I know that
must be kind of unusual.
- It's not unusual. I...

622
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:18,161
I mean, I'm sure that most women
don't turn you down.

623
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:20,629
Meredith, can we talk about
something else ?

624
00:45:20,698 --> 00:45:23,326
Honestly, sex is the last thing
on my mind right now.

625
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:25,631
- Okay, okay.
- Okay ?

626
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:28,866
Okay. Okay.

627
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:32,500
Want a taste ? I mean, I'm sorry
if I ruined your plans. That's all.

628
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:35,511
I didn't have any plans !
I just think...

629
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,013
You know, you've got a few
too many rules working for you...

630
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:41,051
and way too many rules
workin' against me !

631
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:44,315
I really like you, but...

632
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:46,982
This kind of thing
is pissing me off.

633
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:53,158
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

634
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:59,395
I can't understand why you haven't had
a relationship lately.

635
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:06,103
Really ?
Well, that doesn't take long, does it ?

636
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:08,407
- What doesn't ?
- I mean, you turn a guy down...

637
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:11,607
and wham, he just metamorphoses
into an anger ball.

638
00:46:11,682 --> 00:46:13,843
- "Anger ball" ?
- See ?

639
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:17,354
All I said was
I have a good imagination.

640
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:20,618
- I wasn't talking about sex.
- Really.

641
00:46:20,691 --> 00:46:23,683
I've had enough... sex.

642
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:25,695
Mostly with women
I didn't really like...

643
00:46:25,763 --> 00:46:29,028
and probably
didn't really like me.

644
00:46:31,535 --> 00:46:33,730
Call me nuts, man,
but I... I like you.

645
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:36,136
And...

646
00:46:36,207 --> 00:46:39,699
yeah, if something happens between us,
sex will probably enter into it.

647
00:46:39,777 --> 00:46:43,577
But not until you break
the brick wall down around yourself...

648
00:46:43,647 --> 00:46:46,980
and certainly not tonight.

649
00:46:49,954 --> 00:46:51,888
Are you finished ?

650
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,458
- Yeah.
- I'll show you out.

651
00:46:57,061 --> 00:47:00,622
- What !
- Look, this is exactly what I don't want.

652
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:02,598
- Somebody being straight with you ?
- Yes !

653
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:05,897
Yes, yes.

654
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:10,498
You know what, Trent ?
I do not have the stamina for this.

655
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:12,508
I don't.

656
00:47:12,576 --> 00:47:15,511
- Meredith, we haven't even started anything.
- You know what ?

657
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:19,242
We're not going to.

658
00:47:19,316 --> 00:47:22,979
Because let me just jump ahead
to the inevitable. Okay ?

659
00:47:24,054 --> 00:47:25,988
We get together.

660
00:47:26,056 --> 00:47:29,025
You hurt me. It ends badly.

661
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:33,257
That's a really depressing way
to look at a fledgling relationship.

662
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:36,697
Well, there's nothing
fledgling about it.

663
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:39,668
And honestly, that is
the only viewpoint that I have.

664
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,440
Then I feel sorry for you, Meredith, because
I didn't come over here to hurt you.

665
00:47:52,082 --> 00:47:55,449
- I hope Barley likes Italian.
- He does.

666
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,829
What ?

667
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:26,081
What are you watching ?

668
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:28,414
Midnight Lace.

669
00:48:28,485 --> 00:48:31,921
Ah. Doris Day.

670
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:34,583
Oh, yeah. That's the one
where she thinks she's going crazy...

671
00:48:34,658 --> 00:48:37,354
but it's really her husband
that's driving her to suicide...

672
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:39,419
for her money.

673
00:48:39,896 --> 00:48:42,021
Well, thank you, Paul !

674
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:45,535
Why don't you just go... go find
a theater that's showing Citizen Kane...

675
00:48:45,603 --> 00:48:48,197
and yell out
"Rosebud is a sled" ?

676
00:48:48,272 --> 00:48:50,740
- I'm sorry. I thought you'd seen it before.
- Well, I hadn't.

677
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:53,174
I mean, I thought
we'd seen it before.

678
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:55,838
Perhaps you have me confused
with Wendy.

679
00:48:55,913 --> 00:48:57,847
So that's what this is all about.

680
00:48:57,915 --> 00:49:02,375
- What "this" ? There isn't any "this."
- No ? No "this" ?

681
00:49:02,453 --> 00:49:04,512
Do you normally speak
through clenched teeth ?

682
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:07,421
I'm not speaking any different
than normal.

683
00:49:07,491 --> 00:49:10,051
- Differently.
- Oh!

684
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:22,969
You are being idiotic.

685
00:49:23,037 --> 00:49:27,633
Well, you wouldn't want me to act
any different than normal, would you ?

686
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:31,075
- "Differently."
- This isn't exactly what I had in mind.

687
00:49:31,145 --> 00:49:33,636
- Do you still see her ?
- Who ?

688
00:49:33,714 --> 00:49:36,547
"Who ?" Who ? Doris Day !

689
00:49:36,617 --> 00:49:39,142
Oh, you mean Wendy.

690
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,814
You thought I didn't know,
didn't you ?

691
00:49:41,889 --> 00:49:45,484
You think the little woman doesn't know
when her husband has an affair.

692
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:50,223
Hannah, it was 25 years ago,
and it wasn't an affair.

693
00:49:50,298 --> 00:49:52,493
Oh, don't insult my intelligence.

694
00:49:52,566 --> 00:49:56,161
Your intelligence, at the moment,
is in serious doubt.

695
00:49:56,237 --> 00:49:59,001
- Screw you !
- Hannah.

696
00:49:59,073 --> 00:50:01,564
Paul.

697
00:50:07,915 --> 00:50:12,181
Do you really want
to talk about this ? Hmm ?

698
00:50:12,253 --> 00:50:17,452
Because if you do, I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

699
00:50:17,525 --> 00:50:20,460
You might start
by being honest with me.

700
00:50:20,528 --> 00:50:23,326
- It wasn't an affair ?
- It wasn't.

701
00:50:23,397 --> 00:50:27,993
- I never slept with Wendy.
- Oh, please !

702
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:30,469
Hey, calm down.
You're overwrought.

703
00:50:30,538 --> 00:50:32,802
I am perfectly wrought.

704
00:50:32,873 --> 00:50:35,967
Given the circumstances,
I'm even a bit underwrought.

705
00:50:36,043 --> 00:50:38,807
- There's no such word.
- There is now.

706
00:50:40,715 --> 00:50:44,651
Do you want to know...
why I didn't sleep with Wendy ?

707
00:50:50,758 --> 00:50:53,852
I am, as they say, all ears.

708
00:50:53,928 --> 00:50:57,364
Well, I never slept with Wendy...

709
00:50:57,431 --> 00:51:00,423
because I was
too much in love with her.

710
00:51:02,837 --> 00:51:04,771
Oh.

711
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,807
You couldn't have died
without telling me that ?

712
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,824
<i>Keenan ? You going out ?

713
00:51:28,896 --> 00:51:32,491
Yes, Dad.

714
00:51:36,904 --> 00:51:39,668
Hi. I know for this technically
not to be a date...

715
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,176
we should have gone dutch, but the
tickets were selling out so fast, so...

716
00:51:43,244 --> 00:51:46,270
What would you have done
if I didn't show up ?

717
00:51:46,447 --> 00:51:48,838
Well, after I recovered from
the supreme disappointment...

718
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:51,510
and picked up the pieces
of my fractured ego...

719
00:51:51,585 --> 00:51:55,351
I would have run down the escalator and
invited the guy standing on the corner.

720
00:51:55,423 --> 00:51:57,357
You know, the one holding the sign.

721
00:51:57,425 --> 00:52:00,019
The one that says,
"Will work for food" ?

722
00:52:00,094 --> 00:52:03,359
Or a movie.
You should have read the fine print.

723
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:09,531
<i>I'll plant my own tree</i>

724
00:52:09,603 --> 00:52:13,300
<i>And I'll make it grow</i>

725
00:52:13,374 --> 00:52:16,138
<i>My tree will not be</i>

726
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:20,112
<i>Just one in a row</i>

727
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:23,150
<i>My tree will offer shade</i>

728
00:52:23,217 --> 00:52:27,017
<i>When strangers go by</i>

729
00:52:27,087 --> 00:52:29,317
<i>If you're a stranger</i>

730
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:31,654
<i>Brother, well, so am I</i>

731
00:52:31,725 --> 00:52:33,693
Gin gimlet, rocks.

732
00:52:33,761 --> 00:52:35,695
Make it two.

733
00:52:35,763 --> 00:52:37,822
- I'm Lana.
- Hugh.

734
00:52:37,898 --> 00:52:40,526
I haven't seen you here before.

735
00:52:40,601 --> 00:52:44,332
- Well, how do you know that ?
- Honey, you sounded
like John Wayne in a bathhouse.

736
00:52:44,405 --> 00:52:47,340
Well, as a matter of fact,
this is my first time here.

737
00:52:47,408 --> 00:52:50,673
I'm 28 years old,
in case you're wondering.

738
00:52:50,744 --> 00:52:53,508
And that's in real years,
not Heather Locklear years.

739
00:52:53,581 --> 00:52:55,549
I'm also a drag queen.

740
00:52:55,616 --> 00:52:59,518
- I think I figured that out.
- Well, I just didn't want
there to be any misunderstanding.

741
00:52:59,587 --> 00:53:01,817
This ain't no disco, and I don't want
no Crying Game confusion.

742
00:53:01,889 --> 00:53:04,687
I want it understood up front,
I may be a fabulous-looking broad...

743
00:53:04,758 --> 00:53:06,692
but I've got a penis.

744
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,695
- So do I.
- Well, then we'll get along just fine.

745
00:53:09,763 --> 00:53:13,790
So you come on and tell Lana what
the fuck you're doing in this place.

746
00:53:15,368 --> 00:53:18,134
I had a... fight with my wife.

747
00:53:18,205 --> 00:53:20,639
- Old story.
- Well, it's an old story...

748
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:23,302
but it's a newish twist.

749
00:53:23,377 --> 00:53:26,312
"Newish twist" ? Damn, that's a bitch
to say with my sibilance.

750
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,314
I'll have to roll that one
around my tongue later.

751
00:53:28,382 --> 00:53:32,716
Unless you got better ideas.
"Newish twist." Continue.

752
00:53:32,786 --> 00:53:37,086
My wife discovered
I was stepping out on her.

753
00:53:37,157 --> 00:53:39,057
When does the "newish"
part come in ?

754
00:53:39,126 --> 00:53:41,060
That one's older
than Lauren Bacall.

755
00:53:41,128 --> 00:53:44,495
Well, I cheated on my wife...

756
00:53:44,565 --> 00:53:47,159
with her brother.

757
00:53:47,234 --> 00:53:51,830
Make that a double,
and keep 'em coming.

758
00:53:51,906 --> 00:53:54,340
<i>It's impossible
Tell you right now</i>

759
00:53:54,408 --> 00:53:56,876
<i>If I tried it
I'd never know how</i>

760
00:53:56,944 --> 00:54:00,311
He's her younger brother.
Sam.

761
00:54:00,381 --> 00:54:03,179
I knew he was gay, of course.
You can always tell.

762
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:05,514
It's called "gay-dar".

763
00:54:05,586 --> 00:54:08,180
- I'm not gay or anything.
- No, no, no.

764
00:54:08,255 --> 00:54:10,189
Of course not.

765
00:54:10,257 --> 00:54:13,192
It's just something about him.

766
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,526
He always looked at me
like he could see right inside me...

767
00:54:17,598 --> 00:54:19,532
to my true soul.

768
00:54:31,545 --> 00:54:34,981
Don't look at me
with that tone of voice.

769
00:54:38,552 --> 00:54:42,921
Let me... try and explain this.

770
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:46,983
Wendy came along at a time
when I needed somebody.

771
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:52,829
If this is supposed to be making me
feel better, you're failing miserably.

772
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,993
It didn't mean
that I didn't love you.

773
00:54:55,069 --> 00:54:57,264
In fact, it meant that I did love you.

774
00:54:57,338 --> 00:54:59,499
Well...

775
00:54:59,573 --> 00:55:04,169
you seem to have been loving
a lot of people right about then :

776
00:55:04,244 --> 00:55:06,508
the kids...

777
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:09,515
Wendy, me.

778
00:55:09,583 --> 00:55:11,574
Anybody else ?

779
00:55:11,652 --> 00:55:14,120
Hannah, we've been married
for 40 years.

780
00:55:14,188 --> 00:55:16,952
There were some rough times.
Admit it.

781
00:55:17,024 --> 00:55:19,458
Oh, I admit it.

782
00:55:19,526 --> 00:55:22,461
This is one of them.

783
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:25,794
You know I spent a lot of time
that summer with Wendy.

784
00:55:25,866 --> 00:55:29,131
Our production company
did throw us together.

785
00:55:29,203 --> 00:55:31,797
If I remember correctly,
I hired her.

786
00:55:31,872 --> 00:55:36,309
Right. We were launching
your first show.

787
00:55:36,377 --> 00:55:39,813
And... well, Wendy was a big help.

788
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,939
Oh, I'll bet.

789
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:48,316
- Were you really in love with her ?
- Yes.

790
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:52,325
Yeah, I was.
I remember wishing then that I wasn't.

791
00:55:52,393 --> 00:55:54,588
I couldn't think straight
for a whole year.

792
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:59,996
- That's when you lost all that weight.
- Yes.

793
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:03,833
- I thought it was overwork.
- It was Wendy.

794
00:56:06,407 --> 00:56:08,841
- I didn't love you any less.
- Oh, don't.

795
00:56:08,909 --> 00:56:11,002
- I didn't.
- Don't.

796
00:56:11,078 --> 00:56:14,707
I just loved her...

797
00:56:14,782 --> 00:56:16,716
differently.

798
00:56:16,784 --> 00:56:18,718
Differently.

800
00:56:23,023 --> 00:56:25,651
And you really didn't
sleep with her ?

801
00:56:25,726 --> 00:56:27,660
No.

802
00:56:29,529 --> 00:56:31,793
Of course not.

803
00:56:31,865 --> 00:56:35,130
And you didn't want
to sleep with her ?

804
00:56:35,202 --> 00:56:37,796
Oh, good God, yes, I did.

805
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:44,705
You bastard. You bastard !

806
00:56:44,778 --> 00:56:46,803
What...

807
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,144
- Hey !
- Just don't touch me ! Just...

808
00:56:49,216 --> 00:56:51,810
I've had it !

809
00:56:51,885 --> 00:56:53,944
Well, you did ask.

810
00:56:57,224 --> 00:56:59,158
Oh, boy.

811
00:57:10,738 --> 00:57:14,265
A couple times during the movie
I thought you ducked out on me.

812
00:57:14,341 --> 00:57:16,275
I had to use the bathroom.

813
00:57:16,343 --> 00:57:19,608
Well, at crucial times like
these, you should inform a girl
about having a small bladder.

814
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,444
It saves her
from abandonment fantasies.

815
00:57:22,516 --> 00:57:25,952
Would it help at all if I told you
I didn't sit down to pee ?

816
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:28,613
In this theater,
I don't sit down to pee.

817
00:57:36,196 --> 00:57:38,130
Going dancing ?

818
00:57:38,198 --> 00:57:40,291
Maybe.

819
00:57:40,367 --> 00:57:42,631
I'm not asking
to go with you, you know.

820
00:57:42,703 --> 00:57:45,137
We can take this slowly.

821
00:57:45,205 --> 00:57:48,299
Joan, this isn't anything.

822
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:51,970
It's not anything now,
and it won't be anything ever.

823
00:57:52,045 --> 00:57:57,312
Wow. Message received.
End of date.

824
00:57:57,384 --> 00:57:59,648
- I'll walk you to your car.
- Oh, that's so sweet.

825
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,654
That is so sweet.
He never wants to see her again...

826
00:58:01,722 --> 00:58:04,316
but he doesn't want her to be
dismembered in the underground parking.

827
00:58:04,391 --> 00:58:08,327
- Where are you parked ?
- On the "Artist formerly
known as Prince" level.

828
00:58:16,537 --> 00:58:19,267
Which one is yours ?

829
00:58:19,339 --> 00:58:21,933
The V.W. in space 23.

830
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:25,445
There's nothing in space 23.

831
00:58:25,512 --> 00:58:27,446
Really ?

832
00:58:31,351 --> 00:58:33,979
Shit ! Shit !

833
00:58:34,054 --> 00:58:37,285
Shit ! Shit !
Shit ! Shit !

834
00:58:37,357 --> 00:58:39,723
Shit !
I cannot believe this !

835
00:58:39,793 --> 00:58:41,727
I cannot believe this !

836
00:58:41,795 --> 00:58:43,729
Maybe you remembered wrong. Maybe
you're on the Rolling Stones level.

837
00:58:43,797 --> 00:58:46,231
- No !
- The Madonna level ?

838
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,396
- I wouldn't be caught dead
on the Madonna level.
- We'll call the police.

839
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:54,463
- I'm sure they'll be able to find it.
- I can't fucking believe this !

840
00:58:56,043 --> 00:58:58,511
My parents bought me that car.

841
00:58:58,579 --> 00:59:00,513
Joan, don't...

842
00:59:00,581 --> 00:59:02,515
What ? Don't what ?

843
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:05,780
Don't cry ?
I don't fucking cry.

844
00:59:05,853 --> 00:59:07,787
It's something of a thing with me.

845
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:21,330
It's very... nice.

846
00:59:21,401 --> 00:59:26,202
It's a hole, but it suits
me and Blanche just dandy.

847
00:59:26,273 --> 00:59:28,070
Speaking of Blanche...

848
00:59:28,141 --> 00:59:30,701
Jesus !

849
00:59:30,777 --> 00:59:34,110
- You scared her.
- That's the ugliest cat I've ever seen.

850
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:37,014
- She's an angel.
- She only has one eye.

851
00:59:37,084 --> 00:59:41,248
Yeah, but it's her good one. Come on,
Blanche. That mean man won't hurt you.

852
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:43,221
I should...
I should be going.

853
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:44,814
- I can make coffee.
- I don't drink coffee.

854
00:59:45,926 --> 00:59:48,292
He doesn't drink coffee.

855
00:59:49,429 --> 00:59:51,863
- Ovaltine ?
- I don't want to...

856
00:59:51,932 --> 00:59:55,527
You don't want to be mean.
Go ahead.

857
00:59:55,602 --> 00:59:58,366
You're terrific.

858
00:59:58,438 --> 01:00:00,372
Sensational, really.

859
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,409
- But I'm not right for you.
- Wow.

860
01:00:03,477 --> 01:00:06,037
You should write
these kiss-offs down.

861
01:00:06,113 --> 01:00:09,742
They'd be perfect for a chapter
called, "Piercing the heart
in exactly ten words."

862
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:11,750
That was ten words, wasn't it ?

863
01:00:11,818 --> 01:00:16,118
"You are terrific. Sensational, really.
But I'm not right for you." Yep.

864
01:00:16,189 --> 01:00:18,817
I can't say any more
except for that I'm sorry...

865
01:00:18,892 --> 01:00:21,622
and... good-bye.

866
01:00:21,695 --> 01:00:25,153
Good-bye or good night ?

867
01:00:25,232 --> 01:00:27,166
Good-bye.

868
01:00:38,245 --> 01:00:41,510
Hi. No, you did it all perfectly.

869
01:00:41,581 --> 01:00:43,674
I'll pick up the car tomorrow.

870
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:47,015
No, you won't be meeting him.
It didn't work out.

871
01:00:47,087 --> 01:00:50,853
Oh, how should I put this.
He's virtually non compos mentis.

872
01:00:50,924 --> 01:00:52,858
Any resemblance
between any real person...

873
01:00:52,926 --> 01:00:55,827
living or dead,
is purely coincidental.

874
01:00:57,097 --> 01:00:59,031
You want more ?

875
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:01,863
Well, the lad doesn't say much,
and when he does...

876
01:01:01,935 --> 01:01:06,201
he finds just the right words
to crush my soul.

877
01:01:06,273 --> 01:01:08,207
Of course I'm crazy about him.

878
01:01:11,611 --> 01:01:15,445
- Last call !
- We'll have two more apiece.

879
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:18,643
No... you won't.

880
01:01:25,726 --> 01:01:28,718
So, honey...
what's next for you ?

881
01:01:30,063 --> 01:01:32,998
I am going to call a taxi...

882
01:01:33,066 --> 01:01:35,057
and tell him to take me...

883
01:01:35,135 --> 01:01:37,069
- Let me guess. Sam's place.
- Sam's place.

884
01:01:37,137 --> 01:01:39,128
Exactly.

885
01:01:39,206 --> 01:01:41,538
Can I tell you something ?

886
01:01:41,608 --> 01:01:43,838
I told you everything.

887
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:46,003
You can tell me anything.

888
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,639
I have had a good time
with you, darlin'.

889
01:01:48,715 --> 01:01:52,173
Right entertaining, it was.

890
01:01:52,252 --> 01:01:54,186
But, sweetie...

891
01:01:54,254 --> 01:01:56,620
who the fuck do you
think you're kidding ?

892
01:01:58,158 --> 01:02:00,092
What do you mean ?

893
01:02:02,162 --> 01:02:05,029
Lana may be three sheets
to the proverbial wind...

894
01:02:05,098 --> 01:02:07,191
but I don't believe a word...

895
01:02:07,267 --> 01:02:11,704
out of your pretty,
straight-ass mouth.

896
01:02:13,807 --> 01:02:15,741
Nighty-night.

897
01:02:22,382 --> 01:02:25,146
Taxis.

898
01:02:25,218 --> 01:02:28,813
Or... I get off in ten minutes.

899
01:03:23,376 --> 01:03:25,469
Gracie...

900
01:03:25,545 --> 01:03:28,639
You don't have to say
anything, Roger.

901
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,984
It's been fun.

902
01:03:34,221 --> 01:03:36,155
It's been fun.

903
01:03:52,906 --> 01:03:54,897
Can I buy you a drink ?

904
01:03:56,076 --> 01:03:58,010
I already have one.

905
01:04:03,917 --> 01:04:06,010
How about another ?

906
01:04:07,587 --> 01:04:11,523
Yo ! She'll have another.
I'm gonna have what she's having.

907
01:04:11,591 --> 01:04:14,617
I...
I like your tight body.

908
01:04:14,694 --> 01:04:16,685
It looks like it would
do what I tell it.

909
01:04:16,763 --> 01:04:18,697
What ?

910
01:04:18,765 --> 01:04:21,461
- I said...
- No, I heard what you said.

911
01:04:21,535 --> 01:04:25,631
And I'll admit that "What ?" was a rather
banal, cliche, non-colorful response.

912
01:04:25,705 --> 01:04:29,971
What I really meant to say was,
"Why don't you do the world
a big, fat, fucking favor...

913
01:04:30,043 --> 01:04:32,204
and crawl back
into your mother's womb ?"

914
01:04:32,279 --> 01:04:34,747
Some girls like men
to say things like that to them.

915
01:04:34,814 --> 01:04:37,476
Some girls like men
to take a dump on them.

916
01:04:37,551 --> 01:04:39,519
I'm not either one of those girls.

917
01:04:39,586 --> 01:04:41,645
I love your dirty little mouth.

918
01:04:41,721 --> 01:04:45,487
- This conversation is so over.
- What... Hey, what's your problem ?

919
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:48,995
What's my problem ?
Wow, that is fucking priceless !

920
01:04:49,062 --> 01:04:51,496
You cannot be for real.
Is there a hidden camera around here ?

921
01:04:51,565 --> 01:04:53,658
Now, are you a natural redhead ?

922
01:04:53,733 --> 01:04:55,826
If you even so much
as think of touching me...

923
01:04:55,902 --> 01:04:57,893
you're gonna find yourself
limping back to your mother's womb.

924
01:04:57,971 --> 01:05:00,439
- I'll take my chances.
- Yeah ?

925
01:05:00,507 --> 01:05:03,032
Dude, you okay ?

926
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:05,168
Good one.

927
01:05:09,916 --> 01:05:12,282
Fuck !

928
01:05:12,352 --> 01:05:16,288
- This isn't how it looks.
- Most things aren't.

929
01:05:16,356 --> 01:05:18,256
- Right.
- Joan...

930
01:05:19,859 --> 01:05:22,521
I've been thinkin'.

931
01:05:22,596 --> 01:05:25,531
- And ?
- And I feel...

932
01:05:26,866 --> 01:05:28,959
- I feel...
- You could have fooled me.

933
01:05:29,035 --> 01:05:33,096
I mean, that you feel.
That you feel anything.

934
01:05:33,173 --> 01:05:36,142
- Okay, now you're being mean.
- You know what, Keenan ?

935
01:05:36,209 --> 01:05:39,303
- Pardon me for being an anger ball.
- "An anger ball" ?

936
01:05:39,379 --> 01:05:41,609
But a lot has happened to me
in the last few days...

937
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:44,309
on the emotional roller coaster
which I laughingly call my life.

938
01:05:44,384 --> 01:05:46,750
Hell, a lot's happened to me
in the last few minutes.

939
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,913
So you know what ?
Let's just call this the new me.

940
01:05:48,989 --> 01:05:51,549
There was nothing wrong
with the old you.

941
01:05:52,726 --> 01:05:55,160
Man...

942
01:05:55,228 --> 01:05:58,664
You can't treat people
like you treat people...

943
01:05:58,732 --> 01:06:02,498
and then say something
adorable like that.

944
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:06,470
There's some things about me
you don't know.

945
01:06:06,539 --> 01:06:09,770
I don't know anything about you !

946
01:06:09,909 --> 01:06:13,003
Stop. Who's going to pay
for all of this ?

947
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:15,104
We don't need the depositions now.

948
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:17,115
I don't do anything for nothing !

949
01:06:17,183 --> 01:06:20,414
- I'll pay him.
- Then I'll be forgiving.

950
01:06:20,487 --> 01:06:22,455
Good. We must go and give
your mother the good news.

951
01:06:22,522 --> 01:06:24,922
And I'll go count my money.

952
01:06:42,709 --> 01:06:45,769
- We're a hit.
- Yeah, well, let's see
what the critics have to say.

953
01:06:45,845 --> 01:06:47,904
Hey, who cares
what the critics have to say ?

954
01:06:47,981 --> 01:06:49,915
- I do.
- I do.

955
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,917
- Okay.
- I'm sure they'll love it.

956
01:06:55,388 --> 01:06:57,481
It was a good play.

957
01:06:57,557 --> 01:07:00,321
You mean before
I deconstructed it ?

958
01:07:00,693 --> 01:07:02,486
Before and after.

959
01:07:02,562 --> 01:07:05,531
I'd say it was the perfect blend
of Moliere and Meredith.

960
01:07:05,598 --> 01:07:08,158
I'm glad you came.

961
01:07:08,234 --> 01:07:12,034
- Last time we saw each other was a bit...
- Yeah, I know.

962
01:07:12,105 --> 01:07:14,266
It didn't quite go as I had hoped.

963
01:07:14,341 --> 01:07:16,434
You don't have to apologize.

964
01:07:16,509 --> 01:07:18,602
I'm not... apologizing.

965
01:07:18,678 --> 01:07:21,078
I didn't do anything wrong.

966
01:07:22,182 --> 01:07:24,946
- Oh, and I did, I suppose.
- Uh-huh.

967
01:07:25,018 --> 01:07:28,545
But I've decided
not to let you get away with it.

968
01:07:28,621 --> 01:07:31,112
So, I'm inviting you to dinner...

969
01:07:31,191 --> 01:07:33,125
at my house.

970
01:07:33,193 --> 01:07:36,287
Tomorrow night, 8:00 sharp.

971
01:07:39,866 --> 01:07:41,800
Don't bring your dog.

972
01:07:46,172 --> 01:07:48,970
You really want
to kiss me, don't you ?

973
01:07:49,042 --> 01:07:51,169
- Boy, do I.
- Tell me how much.

974
01:07:51,244 --> 01:07:54,077
- Tell me.
- What's on ?

975
01:07:54,147 --> 01:07:56,081
Psycho's going on in ten minutes.

976
01:07:56,149 --> 01:07:59,243
If you're about to say, "That's the one where
the guy dresses up in his mother's clothes...

977
01:07:59,319 --> 01:08:01,253
and kills people", don't bother.

978
01:08:01,321 --> 01:08:03,812
I've already seen this one.
Alone.

979
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:07,986
I was just wondering when you were
planning on speaking to me again.

980
01:08:08,061 --> 01:08:10,655
I mean, about something
other than Psycho.

981
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:14,029
It's almost been 24 hours
since we traded barbs.

982
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,900
We don't want to get rusty, do we ?

983
01:08:17,971 --> 01:08:22,601
I mean, just how much longer
do I have to wait...

984
01:08:22,675 --> 01:08:24,700
for my next dose of vitriol ?

985
01:08:24,778 --> 01:08:26,712
How long have you got ?

986
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:31,046
A good question.

987
01:08:35,188 --> 01:08:37,713
Oh, damn.

988
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:41,283
On the first date
my husband asked me :

989
01:08:41,361 --> 01:08:45,457
"Gracie... do you dream ?"

990
01:08:46,699 --> 01:08:49,293
And I said, "Yes."

991
01:08:49,369 --> 01:08:54,534
From the time I get up in the morning
until I go to bed at night.

992
01:08:54,607 --> 01:08:58,065
You know how they say
the first time is never any good ?

993
01:08:59,712 --> 01:09:02,977
Well, with us, it was wonderful.

994
01:09:06,886 --> 01:09:09,821
I never felt so awake.

995
01:09:11,558 --> 01:09:16,154
I had to reassure him that crying
was just my standard reaction...

996
01:09:16,229 --> 01:09:18,663
to tremendous pleasure.

997
01:09:21,401 --> 01:09:25,337
He held me, and he said
that he wanted to make me cry...

998
01:09:25,405 --> 01:09:28,670
for the rest of our lives.

999
01:09:29,909 --> 01:09:32,343
Flash forward 15 years...

1000
01:09:32,412 --> 01:09:37,679
and somehow the two of us
became one... and one.

1001
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,354
And now I find myself living with
a roommate instead of a husband.

1002
01:09:44,424 --> 01:09:46,517
And I have dogs instead
of children...

1003
01:09:46,593 --> 01:09:50,029
because I can have dogs,
but I can't have children.

1004
01:09:50,096 --> 01:09:53,031
And...

1005
01:09:53,099 --> 01:09:57,229
Oh, I've forgotten
who blames who for that.

1006
01:10:01,274 --> 01:10:03,708
And I haven't cried
in a very long time.

1007
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:19,317
My breaking point
happened this afternoon...

1008
01:10:19,392 --> 01:10:22,793
when I picked up my kids
from day care.

1009
01:10:24,898 --> 01:10:26,832
With you...

1010
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,836
I was spontaneous for the first time
in my entire life.

1011
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:35,264
And I discovered
I'm not very good at spontaneity.

1012
01:10:37,577 --> 01:10:41,513
Is there something that you can see
your husband doing...

1013
01:10:41,581 --> 01:10:44,175
or saying that would
make a difference ?

1014
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:47,845
Sometimes I think it could be as simple
as his asking me to go for a walk.

1016
01:10:51,758 --> 01:10:55,023
Anything, so long as it felt
like a start.

1017
01:10:55,094 --> 01:10:57,528
Maybe this was your start.

1018
01:10:57,597 --> 01:11:00,657
You're a fucking optimist.

1019
01:11:00,733 --> 01:11:03,463
That's my job.

1020
01:11:14,881 --> 01:11:18,977
This doesn't change anything
about Saturday, does it ?

1021
01:11:19,052 --> 01:11:22,988
This doesn't change anything
about Saturday.

1022
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:29,193
So, let me take a stab
at Keenan's story.

1023
01:11:30,396 --> 01:11:32,330
You had a great love.

1024
01:11:32,398 --> 01:11:34,332
The romance of your lifetime.

1025
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,631
Totally cosmic, out-of-this-world bond
with little Miss X...

1026
01:11:38,738 --> 01:11:40,672
and she left you.

1027
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:43,334
You're not far off.

1028
01:11:43,409 --> 01:11:45,536
People get over these things,
Keenan.

1029
01:11:45,612 --> 01:11:48,274
Hell, I'm getting over these things...
all the time.

1030
01:11:48,348 --> 01:11:50,509
Well, it can only be once for me.

1031
01:11:50,583 --> 01:11:53,450
You're sweet to believe things
so absolutely...

1032
01:11:53,519 --> 01:11:56,010
but you're also full of shit.

1033
01:11:57,156 --> 01:11:59,090
You can love again.

1034
01:11:59,158 --> 01:12:03,094
I can't.
Any more than you...

1035
01:12:03,162 --> 01:12:05,687
- Any more than I can what ?
- I don't know.

1036
01:12:05,765 --> 01:12:07,824
Any more than you can stop drinking.

1037
01:12:16,209 --> 01:12:18,200
- Can I get you another one ?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

1038
01:12:18,277 --> 01:12:21,508
- It was a gin martini, right ?
- Vodka, but, really, I've had enough.

1039
01:12:21,581 --> 01:12:24,311
- I insist, please.
- Look, pal...

1040
01:12:24,384 --> 01:12:27,512
And I mean this affectionately,
all right ? Scram.

1041
01:12:29,222 --> 01:12:31,986
Where were we ?
Oh, yes, I've just given up alcohol...

1042
01:12:32,058 --> 01:12:34,526
and you're going to tell me
about the great love of your life.

1043
01:12:34,594 --> 01:12:38,325
- Her name was Sarah.
- And she was your first ?

1044
01:12:38,398 --> 01:12:40,332
Yes.

1045
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,166
Look... it's natural
to elevate our first love...

1046
01:12:44,237 --> 01:12:47,331
to some sort of
mythic emotional plateau.

1047
01:12:47,407 --> 01:12:49,841
But you fell in love,
she left you...

1048
01:12:49,909 --> 01:12:52,173
and now you're dealing
with love's most common byproduct :

1049
01:12:52,245 --> 01:12:54,213
suicidal manic depression.

1050
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,077
Right ?

1051
01:12:56,149 --> 01:12:59,346
- Do you feel better ?
- No.

1052
01:13:01,254 --> 01:13:04,519
It... It's hard to talk about.

1053
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:07,423
I have a friend,
a jazz musician, trumpet player.

1054
01:13:07,493 --> 01:13:10,519
Really terrific. I go and hear him
jam every month or so.

1055
01:13:10,596 --> 01:13:13,793
He plays this piece I love :
an old Chet Baker song.

1056
01:13:13,866 --> 01:13:17,597
And he blows the same notes every time,
but every time it sounds different.

1057
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:21,970
And we had drinks one night...
when I used to drink...

1058
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:23,975
and I tried to tell him
how that song made me feel...

1059
01:13:24,043 --> 01:13:27,809
how his playing made me feel,
how the music... made me feel.

1060
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,974
And he just kept shaking
his head and he said...

1061
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,984
"Joan, you can't talk about music.

1062
01:13:33,052 --> 01:13:36,317
Talking about music is like
dancing about architecture."

1063
01:13:37,223 --> 01:13:39,157
I said, "Well, okay, fine.

1064
01:13:39,225 --> 01:13:41,887
Gonna get all philosophical on me.
It's as pointless as talking
about a lot of things.

1065
01:13:41,961 --> 01:13:43,895
Love, for instance."

1066
01:13:43,963 --> 01:13:46,488
And my friend laughed,
and he said...

1067
01:13:46,566 --> 01:13:48,500
"Definitely. Most definitely.

1068
01:13:48,568 --> 01:13:51,765
Talking about love is like
dancing about architecture."

1069
01:13:51,838 --> 01:13:54,170
So, I don't know.
He might be right.

1070
01:13:55,575 --> 01:13:58,738
But it ain't gonna
stop me from trying.

1071
01:14:00,947 --> 01:14:04,883
I wish you'd do that
more often : smile.

1072
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:07,511
So do I.

1073
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:14,117
So let me guess. You and Wonder Woman
were together a year ?

1074
01:14:14,193 --> 01:14:16,787
A year and a half.

1075
01:14:16,863 --> 01:14:18,888
And you were faithful to her ?

1076
01:14:18,965 --> 01:14:21,229
Completely.

1077
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,030
And you shared everything.

1078
01:14:30,176 --> 01:14:34,010
We... We shared everything.

1079
01:14:35,381 --> 01:14:37,474
That must be nice.

1080
01:14:38,885 --> 01:14:41,479
It was...

1081
01:14:41,554 --> 01:14:43,488
but...

1082
01:14:45,391 --> 01:14:50,158
in addition to sharing
all of those things...

1083
01:14:50,229 --> 01:14:54,325
it turns out
I was also sharing her...

1084
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,028
with a variety of other people.

1085
01:14:58,404 --> 01:15:00,338
I hate to say this...

1086
01:15:00,406 --> 01:15:02,966
because I don't want
to diminish your feelings...

1087
01:15:03,042 --> 01:15:06,671
but, sadly,
that happens every day.

1088
01:15:06,746 --> 01:15:09,271
Those other people shared needles.

1089
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:20,785
She died last year.

1090
01:15:23,362 --> 01:15:27,458
But not before sharing...

1091
01:15:27,533 --> 01:15:31,094
one final thing with me.

1092
01:16:19,352 --> 01:16:22,412
Can I buy you a drink, Valery ?

1093
01:16:22,488 --> 01:16:25,218
You seem to be so good at this.

1094
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:28,454
Oh, I'm fine in scene class,
on stage.

1095
01:16:28,527 --> 01:16:32,463
It's just this improvisational...
I can't do it.

1096
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:34,465
- Hmm.
- At least not like this.

1097
01:16:35,868 --> 01:16:38,928
Maybe I'm just better
at pretending I'm someone else.

1098
01:16:40,873 --> 01:16:44,809
Well, I gotta go... I'll see you
in class tomorrow for the reports.

1099
01:16:44,877 --> 01:16:47,471
God knows what I'll say.

1100
01:16:47,546 --> 01:16:51,141
- I won't be there.
- Why ?

1101
01:16:51,217 --> 01:16:55,278
I... I like this too much.

1102
01:16:55,354 --> 01:16:59,484
- I'm too good at it.
- I don't understand.

1103
01:16:59,558 --> 01:17:02,994
I'm better at all these lies
that I've manufactured...

1104
01:17:03,062 --> 01:17:05,656
than I am at the lies I'm living.

1105
01:17:09,068 --> 01:17:11,696
I have a wife.
Did you know that ?

1106
01:17:14,307 --> 01:17:16,605
I don't think that
we like each other very much.

1107
01:17:18,711 --> 01:17:21,236
Is that something to smile about ?

1108
01:17:23,683 --> 01:17:26,677
Well, it's just that my wife...
She...

1109
01:17:26,852 --> 01:17:29,844
doesn't think that I have
much of an imagination.

1110
01:17:29,922 --> 01:17:32,152
If she only knew.

1111
01:17:33,693 --> 01:17:36,457
If she only knew a lot of things.

1112
01:17:36,529 --> 01:17:39,259
If I only knew a lot of things.

1113
01:17:39,332 --> 01:17:41,266
Such as ?

1114
01:17:43,202 --> 01:17:45,136
Where to start :

1115
01:17:45,204 --> 01:17:48,469
with myself...

1116
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:51,704
with my wife.

1117
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:07,482
They got it back.

1118
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,290
They got what back ?

1119
01:18:10,363 --> 01:18:12,297
The police. Your car.

1120
01:18:12,365 --> 01:18:15,766
Oh, right. Yeah.

1121
01:18:15,835 --> 01:18:17,769
Keenan, listen, I'm...

1122
01:18:17,837 --> 01:18:21,102
You don't have to say anything. I told
you because I wanted to tell you.

1123
01:18:23,342 --> 01:18:26,937
I wanted to because for the first time
in a long time I wish things were different.

1124
01:18:27,013 --> 01:18:29,709
- They can be.
- No, they can't.

1125
01:18:37,857 --> 01:18:40,052
Well, none of this means
you can't love.

1126
01:18:40,126 --> 01:18:43,459
Joan, it means exactly that.
It doesn't mean anything else.

1127
01:18:43,529 --> 01:18:45,997
I don't believe that for a second,
that you can't love.

1128
01:18:46,065 --> 01:18:48,124
- I can't.
- Stop saying that.

1129
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:52,136
It's the only thing I can say
to make you understand.

1130
01:18:53,739 --> 01:18:57,800
This may sound corny, but...

1131
01:18:57,877 --> 01:19:01,313
But you don't want me.

1132
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,348
I'm damaged goods.

1133
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:08,479
For Christ's sake,
we're all damaged goods.

1134
01:19:08,554 --> 01:19:12,490
I'm wandering around through life
with hardly any purpose or goal at all.

1135
01:19:12,558 --> 01:19:14,992
I don't know what
I'm doing half the time...

1136
01:19:15,061 --> 01:19:17,325
but I know that I can love.

1137
01:19:17,396 --> 01:19:19,660
I know that I can love you.
I know that I do love you.

1138
01:19:19,732 --> 01:19:22,929
- I won't let you love me.
- Why ?

1139
01:19:25,571 --> 01:19:28,665
I won't let you love me
because...

1140
01:19:33,245 --> 01:19:35,679
because I love you.

1141
01:19:37,483 --> 01:19:39,849
You love me ?

1142
01:19:39,919 --> 01:19:41,910
- Can I go ?
- No !

1143
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:46,355
Do you know how long I have waited
for somebody I care about...

1144
01:19:46,425 --> 01:19:48,825
to say that they love me
and for me to actually believe them ?

1145
01:19:48,894 --> 01:19:51,021
And if you think you're getting out
of this car, you're insane !

1146
01:19:51,097 --> 01:19:53,190
It will never work.

1147
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,534
It's already working.

1148
01:19:56,602 --> 01:19:59,696
It's working.

1149
01:20:05,945 --> 01:20:08,345
I thought...
I thought you didn't cry.

1150
01:20:08,414 --> 01:20:10,541
I thought you didn't date.

1151
01:20:10,616 --> 01:20:14,484
Surprise, I'm crying...

1152
01:20:14,553 --> 01:20:16,646
and this is very much a date.

1153
01:20:16,722 --> 01:20:21,159
It's unconventional, perhaps,
but it's the best date I've ever had.

1154
01:20:30,069 --> 01:20:33,004
I can't !

1155
01:20:33,072 --> 01:20:37,168
No... Keenan, please !
Please don't go !

1156
01:20:56,262 --> 01:20:58,196
Hey !

1157
01:20:58,264 --> 01:21:01,859
Hi, buddies. How are you ?

1158
01:21:01,934 --> 01:21:04,027
Who's a good boy ?
Who's a good boy ?

1159
01:21:10,943 --> 01:21:13,309
You're home early tonight.

1160
01:21:14,547 --> 01:21:16,811
You as well.

1161
01:21:16,882 --> 01:21:19,544
Well, inventory's almost over.

1162
01:21:19,618 --> 01:21:22,644
How is your improv class ?

1163
01:21:22,721 --> 01:21:25,383
It finished tonight.

1164
01:21:25,457 --> 01:21:28,324
I thought you had
another couple days.

1165
01:21:28,394 --> 01:21:34,196
Well, I should say that
I finished tonight.

1166
01:21:34,266 --> 01:21:36,427
It wasn't what you had in mind ?

1167
01:21:36,502 --> 01:21:38,436
Ultimately, no.

1168
01:21:38,504 --> 01:21:43,999
Well... I'm sure you'll find
something you enjoy.

1169
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,514
I mean, to keep you occupied.

1170
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:53,510
I'm going to try.

1171
01:22:03,429 --> 01:22:06,023
Well, as the British say,
I'm knackered.

1172
01:22:08,267 --> 01:22:11,134
You know what Saturday is,
don't you ?

1173
01:22:11,203 --> 01:22:13,137
I do.

1174
01:22:13,205 --> 01:22:15,639
Okay.

1175
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:18,142
It might be easier
if we meet there.

1176
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,804
Whatever's easier.

1177
01:22:20,879 --> 01:22:24,645
All right. Did you feed the dogs ?
You gave them their pills ?

1178
01:22:24,717 --> 01:22:28,483
Okay. Well, don't forget to turn out
the light before you come to bed.

1179
01:22:28,554 --> 01:22:31,318
- I won't.
- Tomorrow's trash day.

1180
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:42,564
There isn't much more we can do,
except ease the pain.

1181
01:22:43,669 --> 01:22:46,160
All right.

1182
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:48,502
Ease the pain.

1183
01:23:02,254 --> 01:23:04,518
- Mom ?
- Yes, honey.

1184
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,581
- Mom ?
- I'm here.

1185
01:23:06,759 --> 01:23:09,355
Where's Jack ?

1186
01:23:09,428 --> 01:23:13,023
- He's not here.
- He was just here a minute ago.

1187
01:23:13,098 --> 01:23:15,999
- No ?
- No.

1188
01:23:16,068 --> 01:23:20,300
- It was... you who were here.
- Yes, I'm here.

1189
01:23:20,372 --> 01:23:24,866
- You are here, aren't you ?
- Yes, I'm here.

1190
01:23:27,379 --> 01:23:29,643
Tell me about death.

1191
01:23:46,565 --> 01:23:49,500
Remember a long time ago...

1192
01:23:49,568 --> 01:23:52,059
when you were still
inside my belly...

1193
01:23:52,137 --> 01:23:55,834
and the contractions began ?

1194
01:23:57,910 --> 01:24:01,243
Well, they're beginning again.

1195
01:24:01,313 --> 01:24:05,181
- Read me that story.
- What story ?

1196
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:08,185
The one with the rabbit
and the rocking chair.

1197
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:13,751
- Good Night, Moon ?
- Yeah.

1198
01:24:13,826 --> 01:24:17,284
I like the ending.
Read me the ending.

1199
01:24:34,546 --> 01:24:38,141
Good night, comb.

1200
01:24:38,217 --> 01:24:41,448
Good night, brush.

1201
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,988
Good night, nobody.

1202
01:24:46,558 --> 01:24:49,493
Good night, mush.

1203
01:24:52,398 --> 01:24:57,335
Good night to the old lady
whispering hush.

1204
01:24:59,405 --> 01:25:01,339
Good night, stars.

1205
01:25:03,075 --> 01:25:07,671
Good night... air.

1206
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:14,283
Good night, noises...

1207
01:25:17,523 --> 01:25:19,457
everywhere.

1208
01:26:12,411 --> 01:26:17,280
Do you ever wonder if while we spend
all this time anthropomorphizing our animals...

1209
01:26:17,349 --> 01:26:19,783
maybe they're just
anthropomorphizing us ?

1210
01:26:21,954 --> 01:26:25,446
I didn't think so.
Who ? Keenan ?

1211
01:26:25,524 --> 01:26:29,290
No. Trust me,
I'll never hear from him again.

1212
01:26:29,361 --> 01:26:33,957
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm fresh out of jokes.

1213
01:26:34,032 --> 01:26:37,468
What, is that a rhetorical question ?
Why is my life so complicated ?

1214
01:26:37,536 --> 01:26:41,302
Gee, I don't know.
Why is your life so fucking simple ?

1215
01:26:41,373 --> 01:26:43,967
Hold on.
There's someone at the door.

1216
01:26:44,042 --> 01:26:46,704
Well, I don't know until I answer it,
do I ? Yeah, I'll ask who it is.

1217
01:26:46,778 --> 01:26:48,712
Hold on. Yeah.

1218
01:26:52,985 --> 01:26:54,646
Hi.

1219
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,813
Hi.

1220
01:26:57,089 --> 01:27:00,222
I'm just on the phone.
I'm gonna wrap it up, okay ?

1221
01:27:10,469 --> 01:27:12,403
M.C.I.

1222
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:14,735
They're geniuses at tricking you
into conversation.

1223
01:27:14,806 --> 01:27:17,536
I can't stop thinking about you.

1224
01:27:17,609 --> 01:27:19,440
I love conversations that
start with the guy saying...

1225
01:27:19,511 --> 01:27:21,376
"I can't stop thinking about you."

1226
01:27:21,446 --> 01:27:24,074
Mind you, I've never actually been on the
receiving end of any of those conversations.

1227
01:27:24,149 --> 01:27:26,083
Just looking at you
makes me happy.

1228
01:27:26,151 --> 01:27:28,278
I have...
I have to sit down.

1229
01:27:31,256 --> 01:27:35,625
When we're together,
whether or not I show it...

1230
01:27:35,994 --> 01:27:40,188
I just can't wait to hear
the next words out of your mouth.

1231
01:27:40,265 --> 01:27:44,395
But right now I need to ask you
to do something for me.

1232
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:46,403
Anything.

1233
01:27:46,471 --> 01:27:50,134
Shut up.
Just for a moment.

1234
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:52,938
I've been... I've been thinking
about what you said last night.

1235
01:27:54,546 --> 01:27:58,312
I have no idea
why you're so relentless...

1236
01:27:58,383 --> 01:28:00,977
particularly, given the arsenal
of defenses I've thrown at you.

1237
01:28:01,053 --> 01:28:02,987
But...

1238
01:28:04,723 --> 01:28:10,628
no matter how hard I've tried to block
out everything that you've said...

1239
01:28:10,696 --> 01:28:12,721
the message has been received.

1240
01:28:16,168 --> 01:28:19,433
In a place inside me
that I thought had died.

1241
01:28:20,505 --> 01:28:23,235
But it hasn't.

1242
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:28,776
And that place inside me
is alive and well.

1243
01:28:32,351 --> 01:28:34,444
I can't make any promises...

1244
01:28:34,519 --> 01:28:36,953
but...

1245
01:28:37,022 --> 01:28:39,786
I'd like to try and be with you.

1246
01:28:42,427 --> 01:28:46,454
It won't be easy,
but I'd like to try.

1247
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:48,761
Can I say something ?

1248
01:28:56,942 --> 01:29:00,639
You're right.
It won't be easy, but...

1249
01:29:03,715 --> 01:29:05,910
that's okay.

1250
01:29:07,386 --> 01:29:11,450
I want to be with you, but,
you have to understand, I...

1251
01:29:11,623 --> 01:29:13,648
- We can't...
- Have sex.

1252
01:29:13,725 --> 01:29:17,161
It may not be the conventional wisdom,
but it's the only way I can do this.

1253
01:29:17,229 --> 01:29:19,356
At least for the time being.

1254
01:29:20,732 --> 01:29:22,700
That's not a problem ?

1255
01:29:22,768 --> 01:29:28,331
When was having sex
or not having sex not a problem ?

1256
01:29:28,407 --> 01:29:33,174
To be honest, it's gonna be difficult not
to express physically what I feel for you...

1257
01:29:33,245 --> 01:29:37,648
but...
we can look for other ways.

1258
01:29:37,716 --> 01:29:42,813
There's nothing wrong
with holding each other. Hmm ?

1259
01:29:42,888 --> 01:29:45,379
Nothing at all.

1260
01:29:45,457 --> 01:29:47,391
And sleeping with each other.

1261
01:29:47,459 --> 01:29:49,393
We can do that.

1262
01:29:49,461 --> 01:29:52,225
And... loving each other forever.

1263
01:29:53,765 --> 01:29:56,859
What did I ever do
to deserve you ?

1264
01:29:56,935 --> 01:30:01,201
Usually that line is screamed at me
by somebody running out the door...

1265
01:30:01,273 --> 01:30:05,039
not standing in front
of me and staying.

1266
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:07,874
It makes for a nice change.

1267
01:30:07,946 --> 01:30:11,712
<i>Lay it down, child</i>

1268
01:30:14,419 --> 01:30:16,819
<i>Lay it down, child</i>

1269
01:30:16,888 --> 01:30:22,485
<i>And walk into this room</i>

1270
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,934
Ah, flowers.

1271
01:30:31,002 --> 01:30:33,835
How thoughtful.

1272
01:30:33,905 --> 01:30:36,999
Whoo.
We like the same merlot.

1273
01:30:37,075 --> 01:30:40,010
It's actually the very same bottle
that you brought to my house.

1274
01:30:40,078 --> 01:30:42,569
Excellent.

1275
01:30:42,647 --> 01:30:44,672
Come on in.

1276
01:30:51,923 --> 01:30:55,518
- You're wondering where dinner is.
- Uh, I must say.

1277
01:30:55,594 --> 01:30:57,858
I have a little confession to make.

1278
01:30:57,929 --> 01:31:01,194
I invited you to dinner at my house,
but I can't cook.

1279
01:31:03,435 --> 01:31:05,369
I can order delivery.

1280
01:31:05,437 --> 01:31:07,530
All right.

1281
01:31:07,606 --> 01:31:09,870
Chinese food is my specialty.

1282
01:31:19,551 --> 01:31:21,985
What are we making ?

1283
01:31:22,053 --> 01:31:24,146
Some hemlock.

1284
01:31:24,222 --> 01:31:26,747
Oh, please, don't deprive
the kids of their mother.

1285
01:31:26,825 --> 01:31:31,159
- Oh, I'm not making it for me.
- Ah, that's the Hannah that I know.

1286
01:31:31,229 --> 01:31:35,097
Well, you seem to know me
a lot better than I know you.

1287
01:31:35,167 --> 01:31:37,499
You know that's not true.

1288
01:31:37,569 --> 01:31:42,871
Do you remember what you told
the kids about falling in love ?

1289
01:31:44,242 --> 01:31:46,676
- No.
- Well, I do.

1290
01:31:46,745 --> 01:31:50,181
You said that the wonderful thing
about falling in love...

1291
01:31:50,248 --> 01:31:56,016
is that you learn everything
about that person, and so quickly.

1292
01:31:56,087 --> 01:31:58,021
And if it's true love...

1293
01:31:58,089 --> 01:32:01,525
then you start to see yourself
through their eyes...

1294
01:32:01,593 --> 01:32:03,527
and it brings out the best in you...

1295
01:32:03,595 --> 01:32:08,032
and it's almost as if you're
falling in love with yourself.

1296
01:32:08,099 --> 01:32:11,364
- I said that ?
- Mm-hmm.

1297
01:32:11,436 --> 01:32:15,736
Well, 25 years ago,
I needed to feel that again.

1298
01:32:15,807 --> 01:32:19,140
Feel that I was worth loving.

1299
01:32:19,211 --> 01:32:21,645
Because somehow I knew...

1300
01:32:21,713 --> 01:32:26,047
that would be my last time
to have that particular feeling.

1301
01:32:27,886 --> 01:32:31,481
- You couldn't have it with me ?
- Oh, I did have it with you...

1302
01:32:31,556 --> 01:32:33,649
but I'd forgotten it.

1303
01:32:33,725 --> 01:32:36,489
I hadn't forgotten
why I loved you...

1304
01:32:36,561 --> 01:32:39,394
but I'd forgotten
why you loved me.

1305
01:32:43,401 --> 01:32:46,165
And Wendy made me remember...

1306
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:49,833
that I was a pretty
terrific fellow.

1307
01:32:49,908 --> 01:32:52,342
Bully for Wendy.

1308
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:56,346
But I knew that
I couldn't sleep with her.

1309
01:32:56,414 --> 01:32:58,041
Why ?

1310
01:32:58,116 --> 01:33:02,280
Because I would have left you...
and the kids.

1311
01:33:12,931 --> 01:33:15,798
What are we thinking ?

1312
01:33:15,867 --> 01:33:18,461
Hot liquid and facial burns.

1313
01:33:18,536 --> 01:33:20,800
Oh.

1314
01:33:20,872 --> 01:33:25,969
Remember the day
Wendy left the company...

1315
01:33:26,044 --> 01:33:28,979
- and went to Seattle ?
- Yes.

1316
01:33:29,047 --> 01:33:31,140
I thought for a while
you might go with her.

1317
01:33:31,216 --> 01:33:34,151
Me too, but I didn't.

1318
01:33:37,889 --> 01:33:40,483
When I came home that day...

1319
01:33:40,558 --> 01:33:44,654
I realized that I was
more in love with you...

1320
01:33:44,729 --> 01:33:46,993
than ever before.

1321
01:33:48,733 --> 01:33:52,169
How did that thunderbolt
strike you ?

1322
01:33:52,237 --> 01:33:55,331
Because I'd made a choice.

1323
01:33:56,574 --> 01:34:00,010
I took one look at you...

1324
01:34:00,078 --> 01:34:04,674
and I knew I'd made the right choice.

1325
01:34:04,749 --> 01:34:07,013
I know that sounds daft...

1326
01:34:07,085 --> 01:34:10,851
but my love for somebody else...

1327
01:34:10,922 --> 01:34:13,789
made me love you more...

1328
01:34:13,858 --> 01:34:18,124
because I sought...

1329
01:34:18,196 --> 01:34:20,130
to reclaim myself.

1330
01:34:21,866 --> 01:34:24,130
And, Hannah...

1331
01:34:24,202 --> 01:34:27,137
you're still the right choice.

1332
01:34:30,208 --> 01:34:33,143
We made a child that day.

1333
01:34:33,211 --> 01:34:35,145
We did, indeed.

1334
01:34:35,213 --> 01:34:37,807
Our Jo-Jo.

1335
01:34:37,882 --> 01:34:41,477
Yeah. We did, indeed.

1336
01:34:56,901 --> 01:34:59,495
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

1337
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:05,175
Trent...

1338
01:35:05,243 --> 01:35:07,302
I have to tell you something.

1339
01:35:07,379 --> 01:35:10,837
Oh, this doesn't begin with
"Trent, you are a nice guy," does it ?

1340
01:35:10,915 --> 01:35:13,213
- No.
- Whew.

1341
01:35:13,284 --> 01:35:16,947
The problem I have with you...

1342
01:35:18,356 --> 01:35:20,620
We have problems ?

1343
01:35:24,529 --> 01:35:28,295
The problem I have with you...

1344
01:35:28,366 --> 01:35:31,130
is that I'm attracted to you.

1345
01:35:33,204 --> 01:35:35,172
And that's a problem ?

1346
01:35:37,242 --> 01:35:40,370
It is for me.

1347
01:35:40,445 --> 01:35:43,342
It's...

1348
01:35:44,883 --> 01:35:46,976
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

1349
01:35:47,052 --> 01:35:48,986
What ?

1350
01:35:49,054 --> 01:35:51,648
Don't be embarrassed.

1351
01:35:55,393 --> 01:35:58,487
I don't deal with passion well.

1352
01:35:58,563 --> 01:36:01,657
Maybe you don't like that
loss of control.

1353
01:36:01,733 --> 01:36:05,829
You prefer to be the director,
telling everyone what to do.

1354
01:36:07,405 --> 01:36:09,999
It's pretty painfully obvious,
isn't it ?

1355
01:36:10,075 --> 01:36:13,272
Somewhat painful, yes.

1356
01:36:15,847 --> 01:36:19,112
You know, there's something
you'll find out about me.

1357
01:36:19,184 --> 01:36:21,618
What's that ?

1358
01:36:25,356 --> 01:36:28,120
That I take direction pretty well.

1359
01:36:35,533 --> 01:36:38,127
<i>If love is a healer</i>

1360
01:36:38,203 --> 01:36:42,469
<i>We'll be the first ones healed</i>

1361
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:46,135
<i>Lovers will</i>

1362
01:36:46,211 --> 01:36:50,238
<i>You know, lovers will</i>

1363
01:36:53,551 --> 01:36:55,485
- Trent.
- Yeah ?

1364
01:36:55,553 --> 01:36:58,147
You're gonna think what I'm about
to say is really ridiculous.

1365
01:36:58,223 --> 01:37:00,987
You're worried about Barley,
and you want to go back to your place.

1366
01:37:01,059 --> 01:37:04,995
Oh, my God.
This is way fucking spooky.

1367
01:37:06,564 --> 01:37:09,829
<i>Lay it down, child</i>

1368
01:37:11,903 --> 01:37:15,100
<i>Lay it down, child</i>

1369
01:37:15,173 --> 01:37:17,937
<i>And walk into this room</i>

1370
01:37:18,009 --> 01:37:20,944
I forgot what it felt like
to be this close to someone.

1371
01:37:21,012 --> 01:37:25,449
I have never been
this close to anyone.

1372
01:37:32,857 --> 01:37:36,122
We're always gonna be honest
with each other, right ?

1373
01:37:36,194 --> 01:37:38,628
It's essential.

1374
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:43,633
I have to confess something.

1375
01:37:44,836 --> 01:37:46,770
Shoot.

1376
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:53,572
The night we went to the movies,
and you walked me to my car...

1377
01:37:53,645 --> 01:37:55,977
You mean the car that
you pretended was stolen ?

1378
01:37:56,047 --> 01:37:59,380
You knew ?

1379
01:37:59,450 --> 01:38:01,748
Joan...

1380
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:07,824
I may have been
a basket case that evening...

1381
01:38:07,892 --> 01:38:10,486
but I wasn't born yesterday.

1382
01:38:10,562 --> 01:38:12,655
I am so embarrassed.

1383
01:38:14,165 --> 01:38:17,430
No. No.

1384
01:38:20,004 --> 01:38:23,701
Oh... Oh, well.

1385
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:29,738
I so very much love you.

1386
01:38:29,814 --> 01:38:32,442
And I love you.

1387
01:38:34,352 --> 01:38:36,286
And, Joan ?

1388
01:38:36,354 --> 01:38:38,288
Yes, Keenan.

1389
01:38:38,356 --> 01:38:42,986
In time... I may even get
to like this mangy cat of ours.

1390
01:38:45,363 --> 01:38:48,594
She's got her eye on you.

1391
01:38:50,501 --> 01:38:52,469
And that's her good one ?

1392
01:38:56,207 --> 01:38:59,404
<i>Lay it down, child</i>

1393
01:38:59,544 --> 01:39:04,140
<i> You can
You can lay it down, child</i>

1394
01:39:04,215 --> 01:39:09,983
<i>And walk into this room</i>

1395
01:39:16,394 --> 01:39:18,487
I think this is gonna work.

1396
01:39:18,563 --> 01:39:20,497
Yeah ?
Why is that ?

1397
01:39:20,565 --> 01:39:22,999
- Because on an intimacy scale...
- Mm-hmm.

1398
01:39:23,067 --> 01:39:25,160
having somebody watch me
brush my teeth...

1399
01:39:25,236 --> 01:39:27,830
is right up there with seeing me
on a Sazerac swing...

1400
01:39:27,905 --> 01:39:29,998
and I'm not minding it.

1401
01:39:49,427 --> 01:39:52,362
This had better be good.

1402
01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:54,364
Oh...

1403
01:40:01,572 --> 01:40:05,208
I'll catch the first flight out.

1404
01:40:30,234 --> 01:40:32,168
Mildred.

1405
01:40:51,255 --> 01:40:55,521
You don't know what it means to me,
for you to be here.

1406
01:41:00,264 --> 01:41:02,698
He was my first love.

1407
01:41:04,969 --> 01:41:06,903
And my last.

1408
01:41:06,971 --> 01:41:10,668
Next to Jack.

1409
01:41:10,742 --> 01:41:12,710
Did you know him ?
Jack ?

1410
01:41:15,713 --> 01:41:17,738
He was good for Mark.

1411
01:41:17,815 --> 01:41:22,149
Well, I would have liked
to have known him.

1412
01:41:24,722 --> 01:41:28,158
I guess you all thought
I couldn't handle it.

1413
01:41:31,863 --> 01:41:34,832
Until just a week ago...

1414
01:41:34,899 --> 01:41:38,926
I still harbored the fantasy that
you and he would get together again.

1415
01:41:42,473 --> 01:41:45,670
We had some nice talks
before he died.

1416
01:41:46,911 --> 01:41:49,471
I'm glad we had those talks.

1417
01:41:49,547 --> 01:41:54,177
I felt like his mother again.

1418
01:42:04,429 --> 01:42:07,694
I'll never know
everything about Mark...

1419
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:13,058
but I know some things about him now
that I never knew before.

1420
01:42:13,137 --> 01:42:17,972
I don't think we need to know everything
about the people we love.

1421
01:42:30,755 --> 01:42:34,088
Yeah. Hello ?

1422
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:36,319
- Trent ?
<i>- Hey.</i>

1423
01:42:36,394 --> 01:42:38,328
How are you ?

1424
01:42:38,396 --> 01:42:40,330
I'm good.

1425
01:42:40,398 --> 01:42:42,832
I was... I was just calling in
for my messages.

1426
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,834
What are you doing there ?

1427
01:42:44,902 --> 01:42:47,066
Oh, I...

1428
01:42:47,238 --> 01:42:49,331
I took Barley over to my house...

1429
01:42:49,407 --> 01:42:52,171
and I don't think he liked it.

1430
01:42:52,243 --> 01:42:54,939
Actually, I'm sure he didn't like it.
He peed all over my stuff.

1431
01:42:55,012 --> 01:42:59,346
<i>So... I came back here.

1432
01:42:59,417 --> 01:43:01,681
I'm glad.

1433
01:43:02,753 --> 01:43:05,017
How was everything
where you are ?

1434
01:43:05,089 --> 01:43:08,684
<i>In its own way,
it was quite beautiful.

1435
01:43:10,261 --> 01:43:13,287
- Trent ?
<i>- Yeah ?</i>

1436
01:43:15,533 --> 01:43:18,001
Is it too late to say,
"I love you" ?

1437
01:43:18,069 --> 01:43:20,060
It's early.

1438
01:43:28,546 --> 01:43:30,480
She's coming back tomorrow.

1439
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:39,452
And then sleeping arrangements
will definitely be revised.

1440
01:43:53,070 --> 01:43:55,061
Come over later.

1441
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:59,004
I don't...
I don't know if I'm up to it.

1442
01:43:59,076 --> 01:44:01,067
Well, think about it, Mildred.

1443
01:44:01,145 --> 01:44:03,409
I'd love to have you there.

1444
01:44:03,481 --> 01:44:05,415
I'll think about it.

1445
01:44:43,788 --> 01:44:45,722
Mom ?

1446
01:44:49,226 --> 01:44:52,559
- Mom ?
- Yes, out here, Meredith.

1447
01:44:53,731 --> 01:44:55,824
Make three...

1448
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:58,494
Three times as many seems reasonable.

1449
01:44:58,569 --> 01:45:01,333
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi. Hi.

1450
01:45:01,405 --> 01:45:05,432
That sister of yours was supposed to be
here an hour ago to help me with all this.

1451
01:45:05,509 --> 01:45:09,502
And here she is,
looking fabulous I might add.

1452
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:12,344
I'm so sorry I'm late.
What can I do ?

1453
01:45:12,416 --> 01:45:16,614
You can put on a bra,
and then you can do everything else.

1454
01:45:16,687 --> 01:45:18,621
Oh, it's not like you were any help.

1455
01:45:18,689 --> 01:45:20,623
- Why, you know my play was opening.
- I know.

1456
01:45:20,691 --> 01:45:24,127
That's right. Your father has the review
on the refrigerator already.

1457
01:45:24,195 --> 01:45:26,789
Mr. Crabby from the Times
gave it a rave. Congrats.

1458
01:45:26,864 --> 01:45:29,799
- You mean you read it ?
- I'm proud of my younger sister.

1459
01:45:29,867 --> 01:45:33,633
Now to work. Believe it or not,
I have worn these fingers to a frazzle.

1460
01:45:33,704 --> 01:45:36,969
Speed dialing is so strenuous.
I've taken care of the caterers...

1461
01:45:37,041 --> 01:45:40,477
the flowers are being arranged
as we speak, and I've hired a minister.

1462
01:45:40,544 --> 01:45:43,945
You did tell him to go easy
on the God stuff, hmm ?

1463
01:45:44,015 --> 01:45:45,983
Yes, Daddy.

1464
01:45:46,050 --> 01:45:48,644
Gracie, Gracie, Gracie.

1465
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:51,313
The other bearded one
will barely get a mention.

1466
01:45:51,389 --> 01:45:53,323
All right.

1467
01:45:53,391 --> 01:45:55,655
Ah, my Meredith.

1468
01:45:58,596 --> 01:46:00,461
You know, we do have to change.

1469
01:46:00,531 --> 01:46:03,830
Well, if I have to wear a tux,
she has to wear a bra.

1470
01:46:03,901 --> 01:46:05,869
Inside.

1471
01:46:05,936 --> 01:46:08,461
- I never knew what happiness was
until I married your mother...
- Just march.

1472
01:46:08,539 --> 01:46:10,666
and by then it was too late.

1473
01:46:10,741 --> 01:46:12,675
You are so...

1474
01:46:12,743 --> 01:46:16,008
Now, listen. I put you in a seat
next to Hugh and me because I figured...

1475
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,014
you might be coming alone and...

1476
01:46:18,082 --> 01:46:21,609
Yeah, well, you might have to do
some rearranging because, um...

1477
01:46:21,686 --> 01:46:24,416
because I have a date.

1478
01:46:24,488 --> 01:46:26,319
We'll change fast.

1479
01:46:26,390 --> 01:46:29,689
You know you're gonna
tell me every single thing.

1480
01:46:34,965 --> 01:46:36,899
Mom, Dad...

1481
01:46:36,967 --> 01:46:38,730
this is Trent.

1482
01:46:38,803 --> 01:46:40,737
- Hi.
- It's a pleasure, Trent.

1483
01:46:40,805 --> 01:46:42,739
- It's a pleasure to meet you. Congratulations.
- Hello.

1484
01:46:42,807 --> 01:46:45,970
- Thank you.
- Hi. I'm the older married sister.

1485
01:46:46,043 --> 01:46:49,035
- Hi.
- Sorry. Gracie.

1486
01:46:49,113 --> 01:46:50,944
I see what you mean.
Okay, we better get started.

1487
01:46:51,015 --> 01:46:54,451
- We're 20 minutes behind
and the minister has another service.
- We can't go without Jo-Jo.

1488
01:46:54,518 --> 01:46:57,544
- Moi.
- Oh ! Now we can.

1489
01:46:57,621 --> 01:46:59,555
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Mom, you look beautiful.

1490
01:46:59,623 --> 01:47:02,148
- Thank you.
You're forgiven for being late.
- Thank you.

1491
01:47:02,226 --> 01:47:04,990
Dad, wow.

1492
01:47:05,062 --> 01:47:07,826
Forty years ago,
he wore jeans to our wedding.

1493
01:47:07,898 --> 01:47:09,832
You should have heard the fuss
he made this time...

1494
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:11,834
when he found out
he had to wear a tux.

1495
01:47:11,902 --> 01:47:14,268
What an anger ball.

1496
01:47:14,338 --> 01:47:16,363
Oh, Mom, Dad, everybody...

1497
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:19,136
- this is Keenan.
- How do you do, Keenan ?

1498
01:47:19,210 --> 01:47:22,145
- Very good, sir.
- Good to meet you, Keenan.

1499
01:47:22,213 --> 01:47:25,273
- Nice to meet you.
- Champagne. Jo-Jo ?

1500
01:47:25,349 --> 01:47:28,443
- Um... I'm okay.
- Oh.

1501
01:47:28,519 --> 01:47:31,454
Keenan and I are just gonna
have a couple Cokes or something.

1502
01:47:31,522 --> 01:47:35,788
Keenan, did I tell you
how very good it is to meet you ?

1503
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:38,624
Funny.

1504
01:47:44,031 --> 01:47:46,522
Hannah and Paul have asked
their family and friends...

1505
01:47:46,601 --> 01:47:50,037
to join them here today
in their home...

1506
01:47:50,104 --> 01:47:52,299
to reaffirm their wedding vows...

1507
01:47:52,373 --> 01:47:55,103
40 years since the first time.

1508
01:47:58,512 --> 01:48:00,537
What's this ? No applause ?

1509
01:48:00,615 --> 01:48:05,314
Don't they realize what a miracle
40 years of marriage is ?

1510
01:48:05,386 --> 01:48:08,583
Probably not, but I do.

1511
01:48:11,726 --> 01:48:13,956
Hannah and Paul,
you come here today...

1512
01:48:14,028 --> 01:48:17,464
to repledge your love,
your undying love.

1513
01:48:17,531 --> 01:48:19,965
A love that has lasted
many years...

1514
01:48:20,034 --> 01:48:24,630
and will go on lasting,
I'm certain, many years more.

1515
01:48:24,705 --> 01:48:27,469
You stand here today
before God...

1516
01:48:27,541 --> 01:48:30,669
your family and friends
to celebrate...

1517
01:48:30,745 --> 01:48:33,771
to reaffirm your lasting love
for each other.

1518
01:48:33,848 --> 01:48:37,614
Hannah and Paul have asked
to keep the ceremony simple...

1519
01:48:37,685 --> 01:48:40,916
and to that end they each set
a challenge for the other :

1520
01:48:40,988 --> 01:48:45,448
to find a sentence that best describes
their feelings for the other.

1521
01:48:45,526 --> 01:48:48,188
Hannah ? Paul ?

1522
01:48:52,033 --> 01:48:55,400
You are the tenant of my heart...

1523
01:48:55,469 --> 01:48:58,870
often behind in the rent...

1524
01:48:58,939 --> 01:49:02,204
but impossible to evict.

1525
01:49:02,276 --> 01:49:05,302
If I had to do it all over again...

1526
01:49:05,379 --> 01:49:10,180
I wouldn't do it...
any different.

1527
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,924
Mildred, I'm so sorry.

1528
01:50:07,675 --> 01:50:10,803
- So, that's who I stole your V.W. for, huh ?
- Yeah.

1529
01:50:10,878 --> 01:50:14,075
Thank you.

1530
01:50:16,751 --> 01:50:20,209
- And you thought it wasn't gonna work out.
- Yeah.

1531
01:50:24,625 --> 01:50:27,025
That was really... beautiful.

1532
01:50:28,429 --> 01:50:30,363
It was.

1533
01:50:31,899 --> 01:50:33,833
Yes, it was.

1534
01:50:38,539 --> 01:50:42,669
Think we'll be having
a fortieth wedding ceremony ?

1535
01:50:46,614 --> 01:50:49,242
I don't know, Hugh.

1536
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:08,534
Would you like to think so ?

1537
01:51:11,138 --> 01:51:13,197
I don't know, Hugh.

1538
01:51:15,943 --> 01:51:18,104
- Hey.
- Hello.

1539
01:51:18,179 --> 01:51:20,613
Hi.

1540
01:51:20,681 --> 01:51:24,549
- How did you like that improv class ?
- That was... interesting.

1541
01:51:24,618 --> 01:51:27,382
I think it's so cool to pretend to be
somebody else every night for a week.

1542
01:51:27,455 --> 01:51:29,389
I took it twice.

1543
01:51:30,825 --> 01:51:32,759
This is Keenan, by the way.

1544
01:51:32,827 --> 01:51:35,455
Hi. Hugh.
I'm... married to Gracie here.

1545
01:51:35,529 --> 01:51:37,224
Hugh designs video games.

1546
01:51:37,298 --> 01:51:41,792
- Any I'd know ?
- Um, "Killer Golf." That was the last.

1547
01:51:41,869 --> 01:51:43,734
Oh, man, that game was awesome.

1548
01:51:43,804 --> 01:51:46,500
You have a hell of an imagination.

1549
01:51:46,574 --> 01:51:49,202
Hey, you owe me a dance.

1550
01:51:49,276 --> 01:51:51,767
- Just one ?
- No.

1551
01:52:01,188 --> 01:52:03,122
Gracie...

1552
01:52:05,092 --> 01:52:07,026
would you like to dance ?

1553
01:52:07,094 --> 01:52:10,996
Yes. Yes, I would.

1554
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:22,369
You know, I can't think
of a better way to meet your family.

1555
01:52:22,443 --> 01:52:25,003
Other than maybe dropping a bookshelf
on their heads.

1556
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:32,111
They look so perfect together.

1557
01:52:34,188 --> 01:52:36,713
They look so perfect together.

1558
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:38,758
Just like we do.

1560
01:52:41,962 --> 01:52:46,990
Sorry. Now you know the real reason
why I like to dance alone.

1561
01:52:47,067 --> 01:52:51,504
It's okay.
You can step on my feet anytime.

1562
01:52:51,572 --> 01:52:55,133
Just, you know, next time I'll wear
some steel-toed shoes or something.

1563
01:53:19,733 --> 01:53:22,167
What are we thinking ?

1564
01:53:22,236 --> 01:53:25,034
If only they knew what we know.

1565
01:53:25,105 --> 01:53:28,632
Then it would be all too easy.

1566
01:53:28,709 --> 01:53:31,405
- The trumpet player...
- Hmm ?

1567
01:53:31,478 --> 01:53:33,776
- Your friend ?
- Yeah.

1568
01:53:33,847 --> 01:53:37,305
The one who said talking about love
is like dancing about architecture.

1569
01:53:37,384 --> 01:53:39,318
Mm-hmm.

1570
01:53:40,554 --> 01:53:43,921
Well, what do you say
we prove him wrong ?

1571
01:53:49,730 --> 01:53:52,324
I think we already have.

1572
01:55:56,824 --> 01:55:58,815
<i>Don't let 'em get to your heart</i>

1573
01:56:02,062 --> 01:56:07,659
<i>They'll leave you damned and swimming
in a lake when it's only a garden</i>

1574
01:56:07,735 --> 01:56:12,263
<i>The whole wide world feels like
a shrine built to the worker bees</i>

1575
01:56:14,241 --> 01:56:17,839
<i>Who stole it from God anyhow</i>

1576
01:56:18,979 --> 01:56:22,813
<i>Lay it down, child</i>

1577
01:56:24,351 --> 01:56:27,286
<i>Lay it down, child</i>

1578
01:56:27,354 --> 01:56:33,259
<i>And walk into this room</i>

1579
01:56:36,663 --> 01:56:39,223
<i>Don't let 'em get to your spark</i>

1580
01:56:41,735 --> 01:56:45,227
<i>That little light in the back
of everything that sizzles</i>

1581
01:56:45,305 --> 01:56:47,637
<i>It's a full night of love</i>

1582
01:56:47,708 --> 01:56:50,973
<i>The whole wide world feels
like a clan of mad scientists</i>

1583
01:56:51,044 --> 01:56:54,036
<i>Removing the genes</i>

1584
01:56:54,114 --> 01:56:59,017
<i>So they can freeze-dry you
and put you in a box</i>

1585
01:56:59,086 --> 01:57:02,613
<i>Lay it down, child</i>

1586
01:57:04,358 --> 01:57:07,384
<i>Lay it down, child</i>

1587
01:57:07,461 --> 01:57:10,453
<i>And walk into this room</i>

1588
01:57:10,531 --> 01:57:15,127
<i>All made with love for you</i>

1589
01:57:15,202 --> 01:57:17,762
<i>Lay it down, child</i>

1590
01:57:17,838 --> 01:57:20,033
<i>You can
You can</i>

1591
01:57:20,107 --> 01:57:23,406
<i>Lay it down, child</i>

1592
01:57:23,477 --> 01:57:29,143
<i>And walk into this room</i>

1593
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:32,344
<i>Oh</i>

1594
01:57:32,419 --> 01:57:36,014
<i>A hundred candles to make the walls</i>

1595
01:57:36,089 --> 01:57:38,023
<i>Come alive</i>

1596
01:57:38,091 --> 01:57:43,654
<i>A little frankincense
to soothe the air just right</i>

1597
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:48,565
<i>Now take my hand</i>

1598
01:57:50,537 --> 01:57:56,442
<i>And open the door
And open the door</i>

1599
01:57:57,845 --> 01:58:00,177
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1600
01:58:00,247 --> 01:58:03,080
<i>Oh</i>

1601
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:06,313
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1602
01:58:06,386 --> 01:58:09,321
<i>Oh</i>

1603
01:58:16,363 --> 01:58:19,161
<i>Lay it down, child</i>

1604
01:58:19,233 --> 01:58:21,258
<i>You can
You can</i>

1605
01:58:21,335 --> 01:58:24,065
<i>Lay it down, child</i>

1606
01:58:24,137 --> 01:58:26,071
<i>And walk</i>

1607
01:58:26,139 --> 01:58:31,600
<i>Into this room</i>

1608
01:58:34,915 --> 01:58:37,383
<i>Walk into this room</i>

1609
01:58:37,451 --> 01:58:42,388
<i>Lay it down, child
Just lay it down, lay it down</i>

1610
01:58:42,456 --> 01:58:45,016
<i>Lay it down</i>

1611
01:58:48,262 --> 01:58:50,787
<i>Lay it down
Lay it down</i>

1612
01:58:50,864 --> 01:58:53,856
<i>Into this room</i>
