1
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:41,173
<i>Some of the best writing
in New York won't be found</i>

2
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:43,809
<i>in books, or movies,
or plays..</i>

3
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,419
<i>...but on the benches
of Central Park.</i>

4
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,183
<i>Read the benches
and you understand.</i>

5
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,756
<i>Enormous things
happen in every life.</i>

6
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,498
<i>On the other hand, some of
the worst writing in New York</i>

7
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,269
<i>could be found at 222
East 30th Street, Apartment 3C.</i>

8
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,871
<i>The walls of which
were decorated</i>

9
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:48,107
<i>with rejection letters
from magazines</i>

10
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,877
<i>located in 12 countries,
47 states</i>

11
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,645
<i>and the District of Columbia.</i>

12
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,182
<i>When I think
about those stories</i>

13
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,719
<i>and how I didn't realize
what was missing from them</i>

14
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,789
<i>not even tears,
rivers of shame</i>

15
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,191
<i>come out of my eyes.</i>

16
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,794
<i>I wasn't interested
in friends or girlfriends.</i>

17
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,598
<i>All I did was write
and read and mumble to myself.</i>

18
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,434
<i>It's a form
of mental illness really.</i>

19
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:18,437
<i>Now, in New York, you're never
more than 20 feet away</i>

20
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,374
<i>from someone you know, or
someone you're meant to know.</i>

21
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:26,578
<i>But in my whole life,
I only crossed the street once.</i>

22
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,332
<i>I might never have thought
of anything to say</i>

23
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,935
<i>but then I smelled
the smoke from her cigarette.</i>

24
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,171
<i>It was heavy,
I recognized it from outside</i>

25
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:56,675
<i>a restaurant one time, it was
either French or Spanish.</i>

26
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,910
<i>And I didn't speak Spanish.</i>

27
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,445
Shall we continue in English?
Please.

28
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,431
My name is Brian.
May I ask your name?

29
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,600
Arielle.
Arielle.

30
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,602
Like "The Little Mermaid."

31
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,270
What?

32
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,439
"The Little Mermaid,"
it's a Disney film.

33
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,808
The little mermaid's
name was Arielle.

34
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,912
Yes, I'm familiar. Tha...
That's where your mind goes?

35
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,548
She was actually
a very interesting character.

36
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,717
Really?
Yes.

37
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,255
A beautiful woman
who lived in the sea and..

38
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:47,392
...had the tail of a fish,
and yet she..

39
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,628
Somehow for her,
it all worked.

40
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,697
Did you see it
yesterday or something?

41
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,799
No. When I was 8.

42
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:56,635
The day before yesterday.

43
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,303
What's the French word for..

44
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,707
<i>Sirene.</i>
<i>Sirene,</i> nice.

45
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,575
Well,<i> enchante,</i> Brian.

46
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,577
<i>Enchante.</i>
Will we meet again?

47
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,882
I would like it very much
if that would happen.

48
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,451
Well, I'm here every Friday

49
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:15,487
at the close
of lunch in my exile.

50
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,656
You would simply
have to be here as well.

51
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,293
I will be then.

52
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,928
Good. Until next Friday then.

53
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,331
Until next Friday.

54
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,572
Hi, Jim.
How are you today?

55
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:34,773
Good.

56
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,744
<i>Work is going
very well, dad.</i>

57
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:42,914
Well, it's gonna sound
stupid, but the fiction editor

58
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,284
from the "Atlantic"
added the word "Sorry"

59
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:46,918
to the bottom
of my latest rejection.

60
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,453
<i>What the hell
does that mean?</i>

61
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,656
It means I got close.
It's code.

62
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,357
<i>Can we talk
about law school?</i>

63
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,239
No, thank you.
No law school.

64
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,867
<i>Any job worth having
requires a second interview.</i>

65
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,810
I thought perhaps
you wouldn't come.

66
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,945
It never occurred to me.

67
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,515
I mean, because of the rain.

68
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,517
Is it raining?

69
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,486
It was a good test.

70
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,089
A woman has to know what
sort of man she's dealing with.

71
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,959
What sort of man
am I dealing with?

72
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,494
Damp.

73
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,730
A damp sort of man..

74
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,099
...but happy in his dampness.

75
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,837
What sort of woman
am I dealing with?

76
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,339
<i>Une sirene.</i>

77
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,880
Thank you.

78
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,419
So, Brian, what is it
you do in your life

79
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,822
that leaves you free
to wander about the streets

80
00:05:56,824 --> 00:06:00,359
in the afternoons, and smoke
in nooks, and talk to strangers?

81
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,530
I write.

82
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,631
I'm a writer.

83
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,667
Have you published?

84
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,001
No, not yet.

85
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,138
How old are you?

86
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,574
24.

87
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,409
What are your stories about?

88
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,044
<i>Various things.</i>

89
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,946
One is about..

90
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:21,948
...baseball.

91
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,650
One is about..

92
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,486
...dogs.

93
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:28,720
Dogs?

94
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,622
Yes.

95
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:34,826
<i>Uh-huh. So, do you
have any questions for me?</i>

96
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,962
<i>May I ask your profession?</i>

97
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:39,931
Are you asking me
if I'm a prostitute?

98
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,434
No. No. No.
No. No. No.

99
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,906
Are you... a prostitute?

100
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,475
Certainly not.
How dare you?

101
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,844
You brought it up.
I would have never...

102
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,013
I was a model.
I stopped 8 years ago.

103
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,684
<i>Are you wondering how old I am?</i>

104
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:00,819
Yes.

105
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,588
I'm 33.

106
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,629
Back to coffee
with your friends?

107
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,631
Yes.

108
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,033
Until next Friday?

109
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:20,105
Hmm, if you wish, well, I'm
free any weeknight from 5 to 7.

110
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:24,075
Ah, those are
very specific hours.

111
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,210
Yes, they are.

112
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:31,183
Alright. Well... shall
we say Monday at 5?

113
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:33,485
Do you like museums?

114
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:37,055
Would you meet me
at the Guggenheim?

115
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,757
I'd be delighted.

116
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,925
Good.

117
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,627
Till then, then.

118
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,797
Till then.

119
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,676
No, he... he didn't write,
"We will publish
your next story."

120
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,211
Is that what dad told you?

121
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:02,581
<i>So then, what did he write?</i>
He just wrote, "Sorry."

122
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,015
<i>And were they sorry today?</i>

123
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,785
No, they didn't write sorry
on today's rejections.

124
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,086
<i>Well, that's
a step backward.</i>

125
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,955
It's not a step
backwards, mom.

126
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,923
Progress is not linear.

127
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,502
It's about death.

128
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:26,938
I beg your pardon?

129
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,107
And menace.

130
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,243
It's about death and menace.

131
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,846
It's a... boat.
A nice boat.

132
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,983
<i>It's near a beautiful beach
and it's... sunny.</i>

133
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,652
Is there any life
on that boat?

134
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:43,822
No.
And what is the opposite
of life?

135
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:46,224
Death, but...
It's like a neutron bomb
went off.

136
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,226
<i>Maybe they're
just below decks.</i>

137
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,928
And it's not just
this painting.

138
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,163
<i>Look at this one. Ha!</i>

139
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,132
This one has people in it.
Dead people.

140
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,667
<i>They're alive.</i>

141
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,035
<i>Not really.
Look at that man.</i>

142
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,870
<i>Is he alive?</i>

143
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,273
<i>And the soda jerk?
Is that any kind of life?</i>

144
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,807
And the prostitute?

145
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,010
Okay, she's not a prostitute.

146
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,912
What is it with you
and prostitutes?

147
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,613
What is she then?

148
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,048
She's..

149
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,150
I don't know,
she's a beautician.

150
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,952
They're all dead.

151
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,588
<i>And the store across the street
is out of business.</i>

152
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,823
<i>And no one lives
in the apartment upstairs.</i>

153
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:22,060
<i>The tenants have been evicted
and the building condemned.</i>

154
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,062
This Hopper is supposed
to be the quintessential

155
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,064
American painter.

156
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,301
Well, if that's true,
then America is not alive.

157
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:32,037
America is alive, okay?

158
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,206
And you have a somewhat
downbeat world view.

159
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,575
No, I don't.

160
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,009
And prove it.

161
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,210
Prove what?

162
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,112
That America is still alive.

163
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,347
Look around.

164
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,053
They don't seem particularly
alive to me. Prove it.

165
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,357
Alright.

166
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,687
You may be right,
I don't know.

167
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,840
Your accent is beautiful.

168
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,343
Thank you,
but you're a man infatuated

169
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:14,212
and so nothing you say
can be believed.

170
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,781
What made you settle
in New York?

171
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,284
I married a diplomat
who was assigned here.

172
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,052
I mean, I wondered
if you'd been married.

173
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:24,155
What happened to him?
What do you mean?

174
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,924
The person
you were married to.

175
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,893
Were married to?
Well, I'm married to.

176
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,362
Well, nothing happened to him.

177
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,030
He works at
the French Consulate.

178
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,165
It's a few blocks from here.

179
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,335
So... so, you're married?

180
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,339
Of course,
what did you think?

181
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:45,076
I thought you
were... not married.

182
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,311
Why would you think that?

183
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,179
Why would I not think that?

184
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,082
For one thing, you don't
wear a wedding ring.

185
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,685
So American, you need
a signpost for everything

186
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,286
or you'll completely
lose your way.

187
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,656
It's not just Americans.

188
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,792
Many cultures have
indicators of marriage.

189
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:04,162
Rings, piercings, dots..

190
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,232
...designed to keep people
out of exactly this sort of..

191
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,237
...awkward situation.

192
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,239
Do you wish you were not
in that situation?

193
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:17,308
Oh, so we seem to be
mutually pursuing one another.

194
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,044
Yes, so?

195
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,746
Well, I, uh..

196
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,314
I would have thought
you'd mention...

197
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,784
Well, must everything
be mentioned?

198
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,786
Can nothing be culled
from the subtext?
Well...

199
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:30,355
Do you not understand
the meaning of 5 to 7?

200
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,058
Was my confusion about 5 to 7
somehow unclear

201
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,860
because I thought I was
very clear about my confusion.

202
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,296
I thought you were kidding.

203
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:42,267
No. No.
I was actually confused.

204
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,202
And what did you think
I meant when I said

205
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,871
I was only free at those hours?

206
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,807
I thought you had
a very busy schedule

207
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:52,243
or you were unprepared
to spend the later

208
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:56,281
and definitionally sexier hour
with someone you hardly knew.

209
00:11:56,283 --> 00:12:00,285
Oh... it was a code.

210
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,187
A code.

211
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,824
<i>Un cinq a sept,</i>
uh, a 5 to 7 relationship

212
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:10,495
is a relationship
outside of marriage.

213
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:14,132
Seriously the French actually
block out time for that?

214
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,800
No.

215
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,236
1 to 3 lunch,
3 to 5 conference call.

216
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,739
5 to 7 commit adultery.
Look...

217
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,807
Do you set aside time
to break other commandments?

218
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,944
Do you covet at 9:30? Worship
false idols from 10 to noon?

219
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:30,915
It's not literal.
It's an expression.

220
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,351
It re... refers to a time
in the evening

221
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:36,054
where a person's whereabouts

222
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,976
might naturally be
a little hazy.

223
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,526
Okay, I have a very good
French dictionary

224
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,895
and that is definitely
not in there.

225
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,463
No, it wouldn't be.

226
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,265
Now, back in the day

227
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:51,035
such things did tend to happen
from 5 to 7, I think.

228
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,071
But these days,
they happen all the time

229
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:56,441
but my husband and I,
we have found that..

230
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,010
...the original hours
work very well.

231
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:03,448
They provide a set window
and... clear boundaries.

232
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,085
I guess, that makes us
old-fashioned.

233
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,453
Yes, entirely.

234
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,957
So, your husband does this too?

235
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,327
He has a mistress.
Her name is Jane.

236
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,263
And you know her?

237
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,965
From time to time,
I see her at social functions.

238
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,040
Well, nothing
is ever flaunted

239
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,576
and so, no one
is ever embarrassed.

240
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:36,848
And everyone is okay
with everyone.

241
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,810
This is how
we've chosen to live.

242
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,960
One day, I will stand
next to her at his funeral.

243
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,016
Is that gonna
be anytime soon?

244
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,203
I am sure what I'm saying
sounds terribly tawdry

245
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,205
and hedonistic.

246
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,340
A little.

247
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,375
Well, it isn't.

248
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,245
We have our reasons
for the choices we've made.

249
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,283
<i>Do you have children?</i>

250
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,986
Two. Would you
like to see pictures?

251
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:15,988
Yes.

252
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,892
Marc is 7
and Elodie is 6.

253
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,496
They're beautiful.
Thank you.

254
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:26,738
They are the lights of my life.

255
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,274
You're really thrown
by all this, aren't you?

256
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:40,245
I, uh, yes. Uh-huh.

257
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:44,215
I must say that in my culture
it's not judged so harshly.

258
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,317
Okay, but we're not
in your culture.

259
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,920
We're in my culture
and in my culture

260
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,955
if we didn't have things
to judge harshly

261
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,324
we wouldn't know
what to do all day.

262
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,527
Well, maybe your culture
needs to grow.

263
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,649
Maybe there are other ways
to look at life.

264
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:05,536
Maybe there are some people
you marry

265
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,005
and people you love.

266
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,912
Arielle, you're older
than I am, you're wiser I'm sure

267
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,281
and you've seen much more
of the world.

268
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,352
And you're beautiful,
and elegant

269
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,322
and smart, and funny

270
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,057
and interesting

271
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:30,228
and you feel like family,
which is wonderful.

272
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,397
Are you seriously telling me
that a but is coming

273
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,399
at the end of the sentence?

274
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:38,136
Yes, but... being with you

275
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,438
would be... an affair

276
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,639
and to me..

277
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,609
...not ethical.

278
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,178
Unethical.

279
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,415
Not good... ethically.

280
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:59,357
I must respect your ethics
if I ask you to respect mine.

281
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,431
Should you change your mind,
I will continue to be out there

282
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,966
smoking nook on Fridays.

283
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,303
But if I never see you again

284
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,504
do know that..

285
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,788
...I will always remember you
very fondly.

286
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,182
Are you okay?

287
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,966
I'm sad.
It was the beginning.

288
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,656
Of what?

289
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,693
Belief.

290
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:58,049
<i>The following Friday
right about after lunchtime</i>

291
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,051
<i>the pace of work began to slow.</i>

292
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,159
<i>I knew where she was and it was
all I could think about.</i>

293
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,596
<i>By the Friday after that..</i>

294
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,566
<i>Well, look,
French girls just aren't good</i>

295
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:16,648
<i>for your work habits.</i>

296
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,104
<i>And it killed me..</i>

297
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,226
<i>...that she was lighting
her own cigarette.</i>

298
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,577
<i>By the Friday after that..</i>

299
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,645
I can't believe
it took you 3 weeks.

300
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,182
Sorry.

301
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,719
So... what happens now?

302
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,791
Room 2117, 5 o'clock.

303
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,304
<i>Use your key.</i>

304
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,556
How are you?

305
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,626
Very well. Thank you.

306
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,361
And you?

307
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,430
Very well.

308
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,766
Will you have some champagne?

309
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:02,934
Please.

310
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,873
Always look the person in
the eye when you touch glasses.

311
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,243
I know.
7 years of bad luck.

312
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,679
Bad luck?
That's the American version?

313
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:17,615
Yes. What's the French?

314
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,351
7 years of bad sex.

315
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,353
Good Lord.

316
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,989
I think that
tells you everything

317
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,758
you need to know
about our two cultures.

318
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,896
Yes. Yours is
very optimistic.

319
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,633
I mean, a lot of people after,
like, year 5 of bad sex

320
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,536
they'd give up, but you guys
really hang in there.

321
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,338
It's admirable.
Thank you.

322
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:46,811
At any rate, best to look
the other person in the eye.

323
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,012
Yes.

324
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,522
Are you nervous?

325
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,958
Oh, no.
I do this all the time.

326
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,495
I am.

327
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,963
What?

328
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,332
Nervous.
I am nervous around you.

329
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,036
That's ridiculous.

330
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,672
Good nervous,
I mean, uh, like a girl.

331
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,276
Well, you don't show it.

332
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:20,785
I should hope not.

333
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:28,019
Sometimes life
is... really something.

334
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,436
Maybe you should write
fortune cookies.

335
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,447
Are you alright?

336
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:05,383
I was just thinking

337
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,919
I never did a semester
abroad in college and I..

338
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:12,056
...really regret that now.

339
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,258
<i>It was completely different.</i>

340
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,728
From your expectations?

341
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,996
From the past.

342
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,698
<i>Good.</i>

343
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,700
Because I was about to say
the same.

344
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,736
Really?

345
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,475
Wow. Good for me.

346
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:34,044
<i>Just so you know,
you're a natural lover.</i>

347
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,366
<i>Your body expresses beautifully
what's in your heart.</i>

348
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,719
I'm just gonna write
that down.

349
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,421
<i>Have none of the other women
you've been with</i>

350
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,722
<i>told you these things?</i>

351
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:47,925
Uh, no.

352
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,961
Wow. Good for me.

353
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,697
<i>How do you do that?</i>

354
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:54,765
What?

355
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,735
Look like that,
in 30 seconds.

356
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,081
Do you have to go?

357
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,220
There's a fundraiser
at my children's school.

358
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,961
Please don't take this
the wrong way

359
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:28,065
but it suddenly seems..

360
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,187
...impossible to me
that you have that life.

361
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:34,939
I don't take it
the wrong way.

362
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,981
Actually, it seems impossible
to me too.

363
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,844
It will until the moment
I next see my children.

364
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:48,185
I did wanna ask you
something, if you don't mind.

365
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,522
What you said about belief..

366
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,660
...what did you mean?
Can you say more?

367
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,234
It's almost 7.

368
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,884
Will I see you tomorrow?

369
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,986
No. Monday.

370
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:24,588
5. The same room.

371
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,056
Hold on to the key.

372
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,191
Trust me.

373
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:40,004
Say, "Till then, then"
like you did that time.

374
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,040
Till then, then.

375
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:47,912
I like that.

376
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,822
<i>I was way, way
too happy to write.</i>

377
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,828
<i>It was not a good weekend
for the Venetian wines.</i>

378
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,776
Can no American watch
a film without popcorn?

379
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:20,578
That's right.

380
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,647
Do you chomp popcorn
when you read literature?

381
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:26,083
I eat sunflower seeds
and I spit the shells

382
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,318
into a little cup.

383
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,725
I cannot kiss you
goodbye outdoors.

384
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,894
I understand.

385
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:40,731
People can see us together.
That is permitted.

386
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:44,935
I can take your arm,
but we cannot kiss.

387
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:49,206
If those are the rules...
those are the rules.

388
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,319
<i>Between the hours
of 7 and 5</i>

389
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:05,155
<i>I made a study
of French culture.</i>

390
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,663
<i>They seemed to be,
uh, strange people.</i>

391
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:20,270
<i>But then, I'm sure she thought
my people were strange too.</i>

392
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:23,807
So I lost my virginity
on Passover.

393
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,777
Passover?
<i>Yeah. Do you know</i>
<i>what that is?</i>

394
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,912
<i>I don't know what you..
No, what does that mean?</i>

395
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,814
<i>It's a Jewish holiday.
Yeah?</i>

396
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,917
Where you eat<i> matzah,</i>
which is unleavened bread.

397
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,319
Strange.
Yeah.

398
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,288
How was it?
Yeah. You mean the<i> matzah?</i>

399
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,157
Or my... the loss
of my virginity?
The<i> matzah,</i> of course.

400
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,992
The<i> matzah.</i>
Yeah. Now the<i> matzah</i>
was great.

401
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,663
It,<i> matzah</i> doesn't really
change over the years.

402
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:47,331
<i>Sometimes
our two-hour interludes</i>

403
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,134
<i>were calm and prosaic.</i>

404
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,436
Oh, no.
What?

405
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:54,772
I have some troubling news.
What?

406
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:01,045
I don't think the boat
we're controlling is our boat.

407
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:02,312
Are you..
What?

408
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:06,150
Are you kidding me?
No.

409
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:08,318
Where is our boat?
I have no idea.

410
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,191
<i>Sometimes they were not
so calm.</i>

411
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,266
Mmm, mmm.

412
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,915
Brian.

413
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,383
Yes?

414
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,486
<i>Please join me.</i>

415
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:17,154
By all means, bring your food.

416
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,599
Sh..
Mm-hmm.

417
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,038
Hello, I'm Arielle's
husband, Valery.

418
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,276
<i>Enchante.
Enchante.</i>

419
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:45,149
Please forgive any
hot dog related moisture.

420
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:47,284
Only if you will forgive
my intrusion.

421
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,222
I...I thought we should meet.

422
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,093
Arielle speaks
very highly of you.

423
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:59,062
She does?

424
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:00,097
To you?

425
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,532
Mm-hmm.

426
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,454
She says you're
a very fine person.

427
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,138
Funny, naturally charming

428
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,909
sincere,
extremely bright, kind.

429
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:14,278
<i>She suspects
you're very talented.</i>

430
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,082
Thank you.

431
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:22,052
I'm very happy that
she has met you, Brian.

432
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:25,289
<i>For the little time
since she has known you</i>

433
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:30,894
I have seen a light in her eyes
that I had never seen before.

434
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,897
<i>And I'm so very glad of it.
I wish to thank you.</i>

435
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,969
You're welcome.

436
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:41,605
I would be pleased if you
cared to join us at our home

437
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:44,441
this coming Saturday for supper.

438
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:45,976
Really?

439
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:48,612
Yes.

440
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:52,249
Is there any chance that
this is a gentlemanly ploy

441
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:54,585
designed to relax me

442
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:56,887
<i>before your driver turns around</i>

443
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:59,489
and impales me
with a<i> fleur-de-lis?</i>

444
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,557
None.

445
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,493
<i>Well, then..</i>

446
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,530
...I thank you
for the invitation

447
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,132
and I look forward to attending.

448
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,134
<i>Good.</i>

449
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:13,437
173 East 77th.

450
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,605
7:30?

451
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,344
How did he find out? Was it
a credit card bill or something?

452
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:22,579
I told him.
I beg your pardon?

453
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:25,282
With great joy.
You just volunteered it?

454
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:27,184
<i>Of course.</i>

455
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:30,320
Why?
<i>Because he's my husband.</i>

456
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:34,958
Uh-huh. And did you know
about this invitation?

457
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,627
<i>No. I'm not
surprised though.</i>

458
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:38,595
<i>Valery does lovely things
like this.</i>

459
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:41,298
How is this a lovely thing?

460
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,435
To me, this is a wildly,
wildly<i> awkward</i> thing.

461
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,471
<i>I don't know
what he has in mind.</i>

462
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,973
You must understand,
this is between you and him.

463
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:51,575
You have your own
relationship now.

464
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,343
We do?
If you want it.

465
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:56,046
I highly recommend it
to you, by the way.

466
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:57,447
You will come to treasure
his friendship.

467
00:31:57,449 --> 00:32:00,384
He's that sort of person.

468
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:05,188
And somehow Saturday night will
be thoughtful and wonderful.

469
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,590
You'll see.

470
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,396
You don't understand
things yet, do you?

471
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:13,398
Uh, no.

472
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:18,101
I feel guilty.

473
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,070
Why would you feel guilty
if he's happy for us?

474
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:22,940
Because I don't
understand things yet.

475
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:26,376
Put aside your notions
about how people are, Brian.

476
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:29,279
The world will surprise you
with its grace if you let it.

477
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:32,716
Unclasp me?

478
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,512
Brian Bloom.
I believe I'm expected.

479
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,348
What? Don't say that.

480
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,083
Brian Bloom. Invited guest.

481
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:08,051
No, no, that's silly.

482
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:12,456
Hi. Uh, Brian Bloom
reporting for dinner.

483
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,258
<i>Please come in.</i>
Thanks.

484
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,367
Oh. Hello.

485
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,769
Good evening.
May I take your coat?

486
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,606
Uh, sure.

487
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,789
Thank you.

488
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,095
Right this way
for the elevator.

489
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:53,097
Elevator?

490
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,249
Good evening,
and welcome to our home.

491
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,407
<i>Thank you.</i>

492
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,386
Brian. Come in. Come in.

493
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,821
Glad you're here.

494
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:20,824
<i>Your children are amazing.</i>
Ha ha, thank you.

495
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:23,093
<i>Are they real or are
they from a catalogue?</i>

496
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:24,694
Uh, they are
from a catalogue.

497
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,296
Come and meet some people.

498
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:28,698
Everyone, this is our
dear friend, Brian Bloom

499
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:33,437
who also happens to be one of
the most talented young writers.

500
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:36,473
Brian, do you know
Maestro Alan Gilbert?

501
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:38,275
Pleasure.
<i>It's a great pleasure,</i>
<i>maestro.</i>

502
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,743
<i>Mr. Julian Bond.</i>

503
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,545
<i>True honor, sir.</i>
Delighted.

504
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:44,448
<i>And Mr. Daniel Boulud.</i>
A pleasure.

505
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,117
<i>I look forward to one day
being able to afford</i>

506
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,718
<i>to eat in one
of your restaurants, sir.</i>

507
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,388
Nonsense. Nonsense.
I'll give you my card later.

508
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:54,157
And I'll tell Kareem to take
very good care of you.

509
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,294
And this is our friend,
Jane Hastings.

510
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:59,096
<i>How do you do?</i>
Nice to meet you.

511
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:03,500
<i>Now, Jane is an editor
at Farrar, Strauss and Giroux</i>

512
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:06,103
<i>and perhaps this is the first
of many handshakes</i>

513
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:07,270
<i>between you two.</i>

514
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,505
<i>Ah, you're here.</i>

515
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,580
Ladies and gentlemen,
three of my favorite words.

516
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:19,483
Dinner is served.

517
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:20,525
<i>This way, please.</i>

518
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:33,864
<i>You, maestro, though immortal
are not a God but a man.</i>

519
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,905
We know God can be kind.
He can be joyful.

520
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,607
But we also know
He can be annoying.

521
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:46,376
What kind of a God
is that now,<i> maestro?</i>

522
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:48,845
I've listened to my
own recordings at times

523
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:52,482
and wanted to kill everything in
the room, myself, the composer.

524
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,152
<i>Even if the composer is dead.</i>

525
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,790
Ah, and at those times,
He can be vengeful?

526
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,359
Oh, yes.

527
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:05,662
Not if we're made
strictly in His image.

528
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,564
Exactly.

529
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,511
Goodnight, maestro.

530
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,433
Enough already
with the maestro.

531
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,850
He seemed to like it.

532
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,886
I'm kidding.

533
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:33,290
So tonight actually
happened you're saying.

534
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,424
You'll get used to it.

535
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,300
Julian Bond
sure didn't eat much.

536
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:46,503
He's just very polite.

537
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:49,372
Oh, God, should I not have
had seconds on the little hens?

538
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,841
It was fine.
Alan Gilbert had seconds.

539
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,211
It was fine. Don't worry.

540
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,786
Split it?
Sure.

541
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:23,340
You seem to know
the ropes very well.

542
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:25,342
Have you been with
Valery for a while?

543
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,512
A year.

544
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,781
Could I ask you something?

545
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:34,417
Do you ever think to yourself

546
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:37,587
"What the heck am I doing?
This is crazy."

547
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,888
No.

548
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,824
Well, then would you tell me

549
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:44,427
what the heck am I doing?
Because this is crazy.

550
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,530
You're being happy.
Just like I am.

551
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,933
But don't you want
a relationship with a future?

552
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:52,035
I'm 25 years old.

553
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,671
There's plenty of time
for a future.

554
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:55,673
I guess.

555
00:37:56,907 --> 00:38:00,810
Life is a collection
of moments.

556
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:05,515
The idea is to have as
many good ones as you can.

557
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,518
See, I was taught that
there are no free lunches.

558
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,022
That one day the rent comes due,
the other shoe drops

559
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:15,592
and you suffer a thousand-fold.

560
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:17,794
Who raised you?
Jews.

561
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,932
Look, if you wanna be
a good writer

562
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,934
then you can't have
a mediocre life.

563
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,406
I'll give you
a baseball metaphor

564
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,328
because Jewish writers
love them.

565
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:34,778
Swing from the heels.

566
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,080
Okay, Brian Bloom?

567
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:39,849
Okay.

568
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,888
I look forward to
the next time we see each other.

569
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,930
And to the evolution
of your attitudes.

570
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,627
You are a natural editor.

571
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,935
Where did this idea
come from?

572
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:03,707
Oh, you know, I'm just trying
to... swing from the heels.

573
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:07,377
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.
Ah, no worries... mom.

574
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:09,779
Ariel.
Arielle, mom.

575
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:13,049
Arlene Bloom. How do you do?
<i>Enchante.</i>

576
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,818
Where's dad?
<i>Parking.</i>

577
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,986
This neighborhood
is a nightmare.

578
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,855
There are plenty of garages.

579
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,990
Have you forgotten
who we're dealing with?

580
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,592
Dad refuses
to pay for parking.

581
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,627
He says it's highway robbery.

582
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:26,129
And he's absolutely right.

583
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,664
Brian, would you ask
the waiter

584
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,132
if they have a different chair?

585
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:32,102
Sorry?
My back is killing me.

586
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:34,003
Uh, I think all the chairs
are pretty much the same.

587
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:37,507
Oh, excuse me.
Could I trouble you
for a different chair?

588
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,909
Excuse me?
Something with better
back support.

589
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,811
I'm afraid we don't
have any other chair.

590
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,847
No folding chairs
in the back?

591
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:45,849
<i>Mm, I don't think
we have any.</i>

592
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:48,385
It's fine. I'll stand.

593
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:50,387
You'll stand?
It's fine.

594
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,624
It's highway robbery
parking in this burg.

595
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,493
Hi, dad.
Hiya, pal.

596
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:59,095
I finally had to say<i> "Oncle"</i>
and put it in a garage.

597
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,932
Your mother is standing.
I know.

598
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,968
They have no
folding chairs here.

599
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,738
It's The Carlyle, Arlene.

600
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,940
You know when we first met,
she only sent back entrees.

601
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,409
Now it's chairs.

602
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:17,013
Dad, may I introduce
Arielle Pierpont?

603
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:19,082
<i>Enchante.</i>
Oh, no.

604
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,618
I am the one who is enchanted.

605
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,753
That's right.
I studied your language.

606
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:46,543
Dad, the meaning
of the verb,<i> "baiser"</i>

607
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:50,847
which used to mean to kiss has
changed a bit over the years.

608
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,549
It has?
Yes.

609
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,918
What does it mean now?

610
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,521
It means to fuck.

611
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,190
Oh, God.

612
00:41:00,192 --> 00:41:02,525
Pardon my French.
Not at all.

613
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:06,496
Seriously though, $42
for 2 hours plus tip

614
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:08,932
and then on top of that,
after this, we have to drive

615
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:11,000
all the way across town
to another parking lot

616
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:14,003
We're seeing
"The Book Of Mormon."

617
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:17,774
Not the original
cast... but still.

618
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,909
Yeah.
It's the replacement Mormons.

619
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,545
You know it actually might be
less expensive if we leave

620
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:24,080
the car in the East Side,
then we take a taxi

621
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:25,782
to the theater and back.

622
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:28,651
Maybe could we strategize
later on the parking?

623
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,020
What can I get for you?
Table water for me, please.

624
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,989
Flat or sparkling?
No, just table water.

625
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,057
Tap water?
Yes.

626
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,625
With ice?
Yes.

627
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:37,961
I think I'm gonna have
a vodka martini.

628
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:39,829
You'll be passed out
by intermission

629
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:43,099
and I'll have to sing the second
act in the car on the way home.

630
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:45,602
I would drink, but I may
have to drive across town.

631
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:47,570
Yes. You've mentioned that.

632
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,539
Vodka martini
sounds wonderful.

633
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:52,008
One for me too, please.
You think we'll even
find a cab?

634
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,877
With a syringe, if you would.

635
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:55,712
<i>Tout de suite.
Merci.</i>

636
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:59,616
So, first of all,
did you ever hear anybody

637
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:01,751
speak better school-taught
French than this kid?

638
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:04,053
99 on the Regents Exam.

639
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,189
<i>And he knows
the current usage.</i>

640
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,991
And this is within
his whole life

641
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:10,260
not one day out of the country.

642
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:12,161
Something of which
I'm very proud.

643
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:14,731
So, it's nice
the schedule worked out.

644
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:17,300
Brian says you're only free
till 7.

645
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:18,935
That's right.

646
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:20,737
<i>So, Arielle</i>

647
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:23,907
of whom my son
speaks in golden tones

648
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:26,643
tell us about yourself.

649
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:30,179
Well, I am 33, married,
and the mother of two.

650
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,688
Waiter.

651
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,324
Canadian Club.

652
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,561
<i>A married French woman</i>

653
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:47,931
33 years of age,
with two children.

654
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:50,867
You could stop that sentence
anywhere along the way

655
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:53,002
and have reason enough
not to be in the relationship.

656
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:54,637
Dad...

657
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:56,339
These are the same French
who didn't let us

658
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:58,341
fly over their country
on the way to Khadafi.

659
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:00,043
Okay, but it's not
her Frenchness

660
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:01,077
that's really bothering you...

661
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,211
No, but I can't discuss

662
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:04,614
her marital or parental status

663
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:08,051
because if I do,
my pancreas will explode.

664
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:11,321
So instead, I'm dwelling
on the relatively benign

665
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:15,692
but still objectionable issue
of her Frenchness.

666
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:16,694
Okay.

667
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,294
In the war, the French

668
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:19,963
couldn't wait
to give up their Jews.

669
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:21,331
Nobody could
wait to give up...

670
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:24,367
Also, they surrendered
3 times in the same war.

671
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,669
Have you any idea
how hard that is to do?

672
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:28,037
What does that have
to do with anything?

673
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:30,206
Because this is who
you're dealing with.

674
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:35,712
Mimi and Joe Fabercamp
went to Paris for their 25th

675
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:38,314
and they said, "It was
a festival of rudeness."

676
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:40,216
And Joe even had a phrase book.

677
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:42,318
And his cousin, once removed

678
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,822
was at Omaha Beach,
unbelievable in gratitude.

679
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:48,324
$42, please.
Jesus Christ.

680
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,339
I really hope you know
what you're doing, my boy.

681
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,778
I really hope this does not turn
out to be one of those decisions

682
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,215
that takes a perfectly good life
and turns it for the worse.

683
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,418
It won't.

684
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,823
Now what the hell
is going on over there?

685
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,394
Look at that, dad.

686
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:26,963
She fucked her twice.

687
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:39,308
Arlene... you wanna
weigh in, please

688
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:42,979
on the subject of<i> la femme</i>
Robinson over there?

689
00:44:42,981 --> 00:44:44,447
Or are you just gonna
leave your husband

690
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:46,349
to fight this battle himself?

691
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,751
Just like that time
at karaoke night

692
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:52,021
when you dropped the microphone,
walked off and left me

693
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,724
because you couldn't read the
lyrics to "It Had To Be You."

694
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,960
It's good you've let that go.

695
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:05,935
I think that there
are two forces on Earth

696
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:08,171
you never want to be fighting.

697
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:10,306
One is Mother Nature.

698
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,241
The other is love.

699
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:14,410
What?
She's lovely.

700
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,281
It's not an ideal situation

701
00:45:18,283 --> 00:45:20,483
but she adores my son.

702
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:24,187
Now how can you be
a sensible parent

703
00:45:24,189 --> 00:45:27,356
and not feel warmly towards
someone who adores your child?

704
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:32,261
That is
practically... anti-social.

705
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:36,232
Okay. So I'm anti-social.

706
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,967
Not news.

707
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,403
Besides, I'm not telling
you that I don't like her.

708
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,245
I hardly know her.
Exactly.

709
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:48,444
I hope you don't mind, Bri,
but Arielle gave me her number.

710
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:50,413
We're gonna go shopping

711
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,815
and she's gonna teach me
how to walk like her.

712
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,960
I cannot tell you how little

713
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:06,129
I wanna see a Broadway
show right now.

714
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:19,208
It's one of two things...
or possibly both.

715
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:21,277
What is?

716
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:27,550
Either no one is immune
to your charms..

717
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:33,556
...or the world really can
surprise you with its grace.

718
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:42,465
What?

719
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:46,903
<i>Je t'aime.</i>

720
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,807
Just for the record.

721
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:04,120
Okay, we'll start
very simply.

722
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,158
Taste, please, this glass.

723
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,568
Is it white or red?

724
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,339
Red.

725
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:27,243
My, God.
Ah! Really?

726
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:28,444
You gotta be shitting me.

727
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,248
You have the palate
of a water buffalo.

728
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,184
That is about to change.

729
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:40,223
Replace the blindfold, please.

730
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:42,925
Take a small piece of baguette
to cleanse the palate.

731
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:49,298
Okay. Please
drink from this glass.

732
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,276
Is it the Miller High Life
or the Guinness stout?

733
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,665
The Miller High Life.

734
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,983
Oh, boy.
What?<i> Merde!</i>

735
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:09,051
We have a lot of work to do.

736
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,087
I was sure it was
Miller High Life.

737
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:12,521
Now please take
a buffalo chicken wing

738
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:14,390
to obliterate the palate.

739
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,559
No, I was not very

740
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:21,030
like, I had, like,
big glasses for my sight.

741
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:23,933
And I was not very...
attractive actually.

742
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:25,434
I find that very hard
to believe.

743
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:28,237
Yeah?
Yes.

744
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,507
I like it that you
find that very... ha ha ha..

745
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:33,509
I find that
incredibly difficult..

746
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:36,946
...to believe.

747
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:39,115
That was very adventurous.
It was?

748
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:45,488
Yes, in my culture we wait
a long time, maybe even years

749
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:49,525
before we do...
something like that.

750
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:51,661
Well, consider it
a cultural exchange.

751
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,464
Can we do that again?

752
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,239
One day when
you're a famous writer

753
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:05,241
all these people
will know your name.

754
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:10,513
I don't think I want
that guy to know my name.

755
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:11,675
You will have no choice.

756
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:18,654
Why is it that you're so much
sure of me than I am of myself?

757
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:19,989
Maybe I've seen the future.

758
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,234
Thanks.

759
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:34,338
Excuse me.

760
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,175
It's you.

761
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:41,310
Our nanny has
a respiratory infection.

762
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,611
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

763
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:45,081
<i>Valery and I
have a state luncheon.</i>

764
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:49,118
Is that better or worse
than a respiratory infection?

765
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,388
I can't miss it and the
children cannot be left alone.

766
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,724
<i>Pas de probleme.</i>
I have an idea.

767
00:49:54,726 --> 00:49:57,259
I don't care if you're French.

768
00:49:57,261 --> 00:50:00,029
If you're going to live here,
there are certain things

769
00:50:00,031 --> 00:50:02,431
that you're going to
have to know how to do.

770
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:04,333
And none of them..

771
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,202
...none..

772
00:50:06,204 --> 00:50:07,436
...is more important..

773
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,640
...than hitting a baseball.

774
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:15,745
<i>Okay? Elodie, keep
your back elbow up.</i>

775
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:18,514
Keep your eyes on the ball
and above all..

776
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,416
Don't lunge.
Exactly.

777
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:23,152
<i>Ne lunge pas.</i>
Here we go.

778
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:26,389
Oh! Oh, no, are you okay?
No, I ain't hurt.

779
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:28,224
It didn't hurt.
What do we call that?

780
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:30,059
Chin music.
Exactly.

781
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:32,328
When it comes for you, you gotta
get out of the way, you know.

782
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:36,665
Alright. Next pitch.
Do not be afraid of the ball.

783
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,701
If it's coming for your head,
get out of the way.

784
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:42,138
But otherwise, be afraid
of being afraid of the ball.

785
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,140
That's the American way.
Now, hit me in the nose with it.

786
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:45,474
Okay? Right in the nose.

787
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:49,345
Oh! That was great.
Yay! Yay!

788
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:51,480
That was great!
Come here.

789
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:53,382
Throw me in the air again.
Yes!

790
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,284
Three more.

791
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:56,619
Two more.

792
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:58,054
One.

793
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,392
Brian.
Yes.

794
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:06,395
I'm so glad that
you're my mother's boyfriend.

795
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:09,432
Me too. We are very, very
happy to have you in the family.

796
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:13,736
Thank you.

797
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:16,105
My turn to bat!
My turn to bat!

798
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:18,541
Yes. Okay.

799
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:21,777
Uh, give your sister the... what
do we call the catching gear?

800
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:23,746
The tools of ignorance.
<i>Exactly.</i>

801
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:27,349
The tools... of ignorance.

802
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:30,219
Alright, guys,
are you ready?

803
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:32,388
What have I missed?

804
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,458
Well, let's see.
Your daughter is Derek Jeter.

805
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,394
And your son is David Ortiz.

806
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:40,429
I don't know
what you're saying to me.

807
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,465
Never mind.
Just watch this.

808
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:43,866
<i>Okay.</i>

809
00:51:43,868 --> 00:51:46,302
<i>Don't close that stance.
Very good.</i>

810
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:48,204
<i>I wanna see
your front hip, okay?</i>

811
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:50,406
Elodie, how about
some infield chatter?

812
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,178
Oh!

813
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,546
Big Papi!

814
00:52:57,208 --> 00:53:00,910
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.

815
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:03,579
$6000 and they publish
your story.

816
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:05,381
The story about the dogs.

817
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:07,216
<i>The story about the dogs.</i>

818
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:09,685
Which you now regret mocking,
don't you?

819
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,887
No, that just proves that
if you have enough talent

820
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:14,690
you can write about complete
bullshit and still fool people.

821
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,725
But I'm so proud of you.

822
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:23,666
You know there's a ceremony.
There's a ceremony?

823
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:24,668
Will you come?

824
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,704
<i>It won't be between
5 and 7?</i>

825
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,639
No.

826
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:31,974
Can we break the rules?

827
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:33,989
<i>We can't break them.</i>

828
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,545
I understand.

829
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,749
So we will just have
to work within them.

830
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:45,788
What does that mean?

831
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,389
It means that
no force on earth

832
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,924
would keep me away that night.

833
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:58,921
Your future is starting.

834
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,263
One of the best parts
of my job is reading new writers

835
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:29,598
and occasionally,
even publishing them.

836
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:34,003
The fact is, talent happens
when it happens

837
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:36,605
and you have to be there
when it does.

838
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,374
Tonight, I'm delighted
to introduce

839
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:40,442
6 extraordinary voices.

840
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:43,846
New writers
for only a moment longer.

841
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:46,548
<i>Proceeding then
in that ever-egalitarian thing</i>

842
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,784
<i>called alphabetical order.</i>

843
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,619
<i>In her story,
"Kupchino Station"</i>

844
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,821
<i>Diane Altschuler
brings to life</i>

845
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:55,557
<i>the Leningrad
of the early 1980s.</i>

846
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:57,559
<i>A city still bearing
the physical scars</i>

847
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:58,894
<i>of the Second World War</i>

848
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:01,597
<i>and now feeling the full
stifling effect</i>

849
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,300
<i>of President Jimmy Carter's
grain embargo.</i>

850
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:05,834
<i>Elainee, a refusenik</i>

00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:08,537
<i>the character is based

00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:11,473
<i>earns a small hourly fee
standing in line</i>

853
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,676
<i>on behalf of
a wealthy neighbor to buy...</i>

854
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:15,678
I'm not comfortable.

855
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,446
Shh.

856
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:19,081
It's the husband.
She brings the husband?

857
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:21,483
Dad, please.
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

858
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,585
But I feel I should
get mad at somebody.

859
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:26,388
Only I'm not sure who.
We'll discuss it after.

860
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:28,691
All I'm saying
is that civilization

861
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:31,894
is organized by couples...
for better or worse.

862
00:55:31,896 --> 00:55:34,630
Frequently worse, I grant you.

863
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:36,031
<i>But there's a reason for it</i>

864
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:37,700
which is that
it's not confusing.

865
00:55:37,702 --> 00:55:39,468
I'm begging you.

866
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,370
Are you saying
you disagree with me?

867
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:44,907
Would you for Christ's sake
watch your son's finest hour?

868
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:47,743
<i>Brian Bloom's story,
"Run From Becky"</i>

869
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:49,678
is about a forbidden liaison

870
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,482
between two Westminster
best-in-breeds.

871
00:55:53,484 --> 00:55:55,584
<i>One, a German Shepherd
and the other</i>

872
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:58,454
<i>a Nova Scotia
Duck Tolling Retriever.</i>

873
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,991
I have been reading
your magazine since my parents

874
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:05,561
got me a subscription
when I went away to college.

875
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:07,696
That makes me very proud.
Thank you.

876
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:10,766
And a copy of the "New
Yorker's View Of The World"

877
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:13,068
cover hangs in
our guest bathroom.

878
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:16,672
A lovely tribute
and soon your son's story
will hang right beside it.

879
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:18,841
Oh, no. It's gonna hang
in the living room.

880
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:20,576
<i>Of course. Of course.</i>

881
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:22,444
But if he keeps writing
the way he is now

882
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:23,846
he's gonna fill every wall
in the house.

883
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:26,448
That's very kind.

884
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,951
You are a very nice man.
<i>Thank you.</i>

885
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:31,019
I thought
you were gonna be gruffer.

886
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:32,755
Didn't you think
he'd be gruffer?

887
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:35,824
I was expecting a real SOB.
Okay, then.

888
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:38,994
Can I borrow the two of you
for just one moment?

889
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:41,163
Yes.
Excuse us?

890
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:42,865
The all-important
schmoozefest.

891
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:43,999
Go. Do.

892
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,904
Nice save.

893
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,507
So I assume you'll be rescinding
the award now.

894
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:53,542
What? You think
I don't have parents?

895
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:56,512
Besides, everything I said
to you was true.

896
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:58,547
All the winning stories
were terrific

897
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:00,649
but yours carried with it,
I don't know..

898
00:57:00,651 --> 00:57:02,718
...the tease of greatness.

899
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,087
Make of it what you will.

900
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,955
Thank you.

901
00:57:06,957 --> 00:57:08,197
We'll see each other again.

902
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,628
Golly.
Golly?

903
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:15,564
You are a person
who says, "Golly?"

904
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:18,133
It just came out.
First time in my life.

905
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,437
Okay.
Listen, fast and close.

906
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:24,072
Come here.

907
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:28,944
Okay. My boss is upstairs
at the reception.

908
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,646
He wants to meet you.

909
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:33,482
He read your story
or at least, half of it.

910
00:57:33,484 --> 00:57:34,683
He loved it.

911
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:37,219
He... he said
it was a little episodic

912
00:57:37,221 --> 00:57:39,855
which only means he read it
in several sittings.

913
00:57:39,857 --> 00:57:42,991
He loves your voice. Loves!

914
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:45,127
He wants you to start a novel.

915
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:48,597
He wants to publish you.
He... he never says that.

916
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,232
He hates everything.

917
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:53,168
He just wants to meet you
for one minute first

918
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:56,104
and make sure that
you're not a lunatic...

919
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:58,040
What the hell is wrong with you?

920
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,245
She brought Valery.

921
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:05,581
Of course, she did.
Rules are rules.

922
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:09,551
So this shouldn't bother me?
It doesn't bother you at all?

923
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:12,488
To see them here, on a night
like this, in your world...

924
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,691
Okay. Get your head right.

925
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:18,994
Get your head right right now
because you're about to have

926
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:21,630
the most important conversation
of your life.

927
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:23,665
And it's not just
your future here.

928
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,868
It's mine too.
So can you do it?

929
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:30,005
Can you put the French lady out
of your mind for 9 seconds?

930
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,574
Please.
Just stick out your hand.

931
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:35,944
Say, "How do you do, sir?"
like a normal human being

932
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:38,580
so you can have the career
that you have always dreamed of

933
00:58:38,582 --> 00:58:40,883
or are you just gonna blow it
and incinerate

934
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:44,286
and dissolve like a Kleenex
in a fat man's sneeze?

935
00:58:44,288 --> 00:58:46,088
Is... is your head right?

936
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:49,691
Is your head right?

937
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,960
Is... your head... right?

938
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,031
You are much crazier
than I am.

939
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,800
Is your head right?
Yes. Yes.

940
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:00,269
My head is right.
Okay.

941
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:02,104
Okay.

942
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:05,107
"How do you do, sir?"
That's all you have to say.

943
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:07,709
"How do you do, sir?
How do you do, sir?"

944
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,712
"How do you do, sir?
How do you do, sir?"

945
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,849
Brian Bloom, I would like you
to meet Jonathan Galassi.

946
00:59:13,851 --> 00:59:16,251
Our publisher.
How do you do, sir?

947
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:18,587
Did Jane tell you
to say that?

948
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:20,255
Yes. She did, sir.

949
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:23,559
Well... over the coming years

950
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:26,094
I want you to do
almost everything she says.

951
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:30,666
I'm pretty sure I already do.

952
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:33,969
I can't wait to read
what you write when..

953
00:59:33,971 --> 00:59:35,971
...you've got something
to write about.

954
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,574
On that day

955
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:40,909
I'll be honored
to publish you.

956
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,844
The honor will be all mine.

957
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:46,348
Uh, that is my happy noise.

958
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:00,028
I don't mean to meddle,
but you don't stop

959
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:03,031
being a parent just because
your son's name is in the paper.

960
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:06,168
I appreciate that, dad.
Sam, he will figure it out.

961
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,103
Can I finish
this conversation?

962
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:09,638
You have finished it 8 times.

963
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,840
In 30 years,
I don't remember once

964
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:13,742
ever being able
to finish a sentence.

965
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:15,877
Well, with your subjects,
you don't deserve predicate.

966
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:17,312
Oh. What is that?

967
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:20,916
A grammar insult.
A syntax barb.

968
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:25,253
Not everyone is as lucky
as we were, alright?

969
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:28,924
Not everyone has it simple.
I know that.

970
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:31,727
Do you remember
how sure we were?

971
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:34,630
And how quickly
and how little was in our way?

972
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,834
Do you remember
what you said to me

973
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:42,037
after the very fist time
we had intercourse?

974
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:43,739
Are you hungry?

975
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:46,675
Before that.

976
01:00:46,677 --> 01:00:48,410
Yes. I remember.

977
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:57,352
I should go.
Why are we leaving you here?

978
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:59,354
I'd like to walk.
Why?

979
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:01,990
There's a lot to think about.
You could get mugged.

980
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,226
By who?
An exhausted office worker?

981
01:01:04,228 --> 01:01:05,994
Arlene,
your son is a madman.

982
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,164
Because he walks?
You should try it.

983
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,033
I'm really glad
you guys came tonight.

984
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:12,701
Thank you.

985
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:15,137
Listen to me,
I couldn't be prouder.

986
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:17,939
Me too, son.
Honestly.

987
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:20,042
We are now officially
spending that law school money.

988
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:21,910
Half of it.

989
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:25,247
I love you both.
Please drive home safely, okay?

990
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:27,449
We'll give you two and half
rings when we reach.

991
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:29,451
Alright.

992
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:32,988
The GW or the Tappan Zee?

993
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,923
At this hour?

994
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,967
Hello.

995
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:20,135
<i>I need your help
with jewelry.</i>

996
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:21,970
I beg your pardon.

997
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:25,373
What jewelry stores
does Arielle respect?

998
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:28,176
It's midnight.
<i>Yes.</i>

999
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:29,978
Why are you asking me this?

1000
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:33,081
Because I'm spotty
on women's accessories.

1001
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,784
Why are you
buying her jewelry?

1002
01:02:35,786 --> 01:02:38,053
Do I have to say?

1003
01:02:38,055 --> 01:02:40,489
You're gonna be my writer.
I'm going to be your editor.

1004
01:02:40,491 --> 01:02:42,524
We're going to have
this kind of relationship.

1005
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:44,326
What kind of relationship?

1006
01:02:44,328 --> 01:02:47,062
The kind where you call me
in the middle of the night

1007
01:02:47,064 --> 01:02:50,298
asking me crazy questions
and I talk you off the ledge.

1008
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:54,402
Could you please just tell me
where to shop for her?

1009
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:56,238
What genre of jewelry?

1010
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,039
There are genres?

1011
01:02:58,041 --> 01:02:59,775
<i>Fun or important?</i>

1012
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:05,247
Important.
<i>You can't afford important.</i>

1013
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:08,150
As important as I can afford.

1014
01:03:08,152 --> 01:03:10,018
<i>Give me a dollar figure.</i>

1015
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,454
$6000, including tax.

1016
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:20,962
Dior.

1017
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:28,336
Okie-dokie, then.

1018
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:31,907
<i>I'm gonna get
some sleep now, okay?</i>

1019
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:33,175
I knew you'd know.

1020
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:41,449
I wish it were
tomorrow at 5.

1021
01:03:41,451 --> 01:03:43,218
Can you stay
for another moment?

1022
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,821
There's something I wanna say.

1023
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:47,155
Of course.

1024
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,996
I would like
to be a good writer.

1025
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:57,198
And tell stories that mean
something to people.

1026
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:03,939
But the only thing..

1027
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:07,375
...I really want in this world..

1028
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:09,611
...is to be the man
who walks beside you.

1029
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:15,917
You do walk beside me.
Not just from 5 to 7.

1030
01:04:15,919 --> 01:04:18,587
It's not enough.
Not nearly.

1031
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,101
Marry me, Arielle.

1032
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,536
I wanna be your husband.

1033
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:38,240
And stepfather to your children
and if you wish it

1034
01:04:38,242 --> 01:04:41,142
I want us to have
children together.

1035
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:46,214
I am already married.
I know.

1036
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:50,485
And that's why this is not
a conventional engagement ring.

1037
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,054
That and the fact that
a conventional engagement ring

1038
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,656
will require
a somewhat more

1039
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:57,025
robust conquest
of the marketplace.

1040
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,130
You know the situation.
I do.

1041
01:05:02,132 --> 01:05:03,531
You know the rules.

1042
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:06,534
I do and I can
no longer play by them.

1043
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:15,243
We had a trust
that you have now broken.

1044
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,344
I know.

1045
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:20,115
And I can't help it.

1046
01:05:20,117 --> 01:05:23,285
I've found the person
I wanna spend my life with.

1047
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:26,421
That is a drive much stronger
than any set of rules

1048
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:29,958
or any doubts about the meaning
and purpose of marriage.

1049
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:36,164
Of course, if your... feelings
aren't as strong as mine

1050
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:39,701
then... I completely understand.

1051
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,704
They are.

1052
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,674
You know that they are.

1053
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,044
They are.

1054
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,380
From the first moment.

1055
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:06,428
You really think you're ready
to be a stepfather?

1056
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:08,096
I know I am.

1057
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,634
You will be growing up
in a very big hurry

1058
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,369
skipping your young adulthood.

1059
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:17,305
Frankly, it's overrated.

1060
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,607
Regular adulthood
seems much better.

1061
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:23,278
I'm 9 years
older than you.

1062
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,679
I don't care.

1063
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:27,182
When you're 34,
I will be 43.

1064
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:30,452
Women are at their
most beautiful in their 40s.

1065
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:31,653
Okay. That's true.

1066
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:34,322
But 10 years after
that I'll be 53.

1067
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:37,425
At which point I will believe
that women are at their most
beautiful in their 50s.

1068
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:40,362
Oh, and 10 years after that?
What are we doing, sums now?

1069
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,697
No.

1070
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:52,273
Do you believe that keeping
a marriage together

1071
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:54,342
is always best
for the children?

1072
01:06:57,246 --> 01:07:00,048
If I believed that..

1073
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:02,784
...I wouldn't be asking
you to do this.

1074
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:08,056
But if you believe it,
then... you have to say no.

1075
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,628
This is complicated.

1076
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:17,132
This is very... very complicated.

1077
01:07:17,134 --> 01:07:19,601
It's not.
I mean, yes, it is.

1078
01:07:19,603 --> 01:07:22,370
Of course, it is,
but at the same time

1079
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:25,140
it's very simple.

1080
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:27,509
What are we willing
to do for love?

1081
01:07:56,605 --> 01:08:00,175
How did you know the size?

1082
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:02,477
I described your hands
to the salesman.

1083
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,089
Are you saying yes?

1084
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:38,546
Meet me here tomorrow.

1085
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:40,381
I'll bring a suitcase.

1086
01:08:40,383 --> 01:08:42,517
We will live here
for the first little while.

1087
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:48,823
I will tell Valery tonight.
I will not be able to call you.

1088
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:51,860
Just..

1089
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:56,598
...be here... tomorrow.

1090
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:00,668
At 5.

1091
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,804
At 4.
At 4?

1092
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:07,342
There are no rules anymore.

1093
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,224
Yes?

1094
01:09:56,226 --> 01:09:58,826
It's Valery.
Let me in, please.

1095
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,432
Apartment 3C.

1096
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,562
Please come in.

1097
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,231
Thank you.

1098
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:44,572
Would you like something?
I have, um...

1099
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:56,884
We had an understanding.

1100
01:10:56,886 --> 01:10:59,754
A clear, honorable
and tacitly acknowledged

1101
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:01,756
set of boundaries.

1102
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:04,325
I know.

1103
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:07,362
I have welcomed you
into my family

1104
01:11:07,364 --> 01:11:08,997
under a certain aegis

1105
01:11:08,999 --> 01:11:11,266
and now you have betrayed
everyone involved.

1106
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,035
I had no choice.

1107
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:20,575
Are you certain
you know what you're doing?

1108
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:23,311
Yes.

1109
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:24,646
I'm sorry.

1110
01:11:24,648 --> 01:11:26,547
I meant no injury.

1111
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,586
I know.

1112
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:33,821
I'm sure that if the roles
had been reversed

1113
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:36,357
I would've done the same.

1114
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:44,365
See to her.

1115
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,458
Mr. Bloom.

1116
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,996
Yes?

1117
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:16,898
Madam Pierpont
was here earlier.

1118
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,866
She asked me
to give this to you.

1119
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:23,765
<i>I started working
when I was 11.</i>

1120
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:26,768
<i>By 25, I could feel the end
of my career coming.</i>

1121
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:29,904
<i>I thought, "What happens now?"</i>

1122
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:32,407
<i>"What will be my life?"</i>

1123
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:34,575
<i>I was terrified.</i>

1124
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:38,679
<i>And so I made
an error of youth.</i>

1125
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:40,882
<i>Some of the girls were lucky.</i>

1126
01:13:40,884 --> 01:13:45,586
<i>They had fallen in love,
but not me. Not once.</i>

1127
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:47,655
<i>Even though I had been
all over the world</i>

1128
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:50,758
<i>and I had met everyone.</i>

1129
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,494
<i>That spring, I was introduced
to Valery.</i>

1130
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:56,531
<i>He was then just as he is now.</i>

1131
01:13:56,533 --> 01:14:00,735
<i>Solid. Substantial.
And good.</i>

1132
01:14:00,737 --> 01:14:05,506
<i>"The salt of the Earth,"
as American like to say.</i>

1133
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:08,643
<i>I felt a great affection
for him.</i>

1134
01:14:08,645 --> 01:14:10,578
<i>A great respect.</i>

1135
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,880
<i>That is a kind of love.</i>

1136
01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:16,984
<i>I thought it was the only kind
I would ever know.</i>

1137
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:18,686
<i>I didn't believe enough.</i>

1138
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,956
<i>I didn't believe in love.</i>

1139
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,528
<i>8 years later</i>

1140
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:29,730
<i>I discovered that
I should have.</i>

1141
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:34,969
<i>It has stunned me,
this new happiness</i>

1142
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,571
<i>which came out of nowhere.</i>

1143
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:42,143
<i>This secret door
that has opened in me.</i>

1144
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:46,647
<i>I have never felt so alive..</i>

1145
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:52,019
<i>...as when I am in your arms.</i>

1146
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:55,556
<i>It is tempting, so tempting
to forget about everything</i>

1147
01:14:55,558 --> 01:14:58,826
<i>and just accept this gift.</i>

1148
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:02,063
<i>But I cannot.</i>

1149
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:03,998
<i>And not because I don't believe</i>

1150
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,502
<i>that you would be a marvelous
stepfather to Marc and Elodie.</i>

1151
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:09,570
<i>And a wonderful father
to the children</i>

1152
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:12,773
<i>we might have had together.</i>

1153
01:15:12,775 --> 01:15:16,811
<i>Not because of lifestyle
or the difference in our ages</i>

1154
01:15:16,813 --> 01:15:20,681
<i>or the opinions of others.</i>

1155
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,885
<i>When Valery and I married,
we wrote our own vows.</i>

1156
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,635
<i>He has always kept his promise</i>

1157
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:44,772
<i>and I feel I must keep mine.</i>

1158
01:15:44,774 --> 01:15:47,842
<i>But it's more
than a matter of honor.</i>

1159
01:15:47,844 --> 01:15:50,978
<i>One day, Brian,
when you have children</i>

1160
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:55,149
<i>you'll understand that to leave
them is to leave yourself.</i>

1161
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:58,920
<i>And to injure them,
unthinkable.</i>

1162
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:03,591
<i>I told you,
I'm an old-fashioned girl.</i>

1163
01:16:03,593 --> 01:16:05,893
<i>Please do not try
to contact me.</i>

1164
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:08,863
<i>It will not change anything.</i>

1165
01:16:08,865 --> 01:16:12,600
<i>I am so sad to say goodbye.</i>

1166
01:16:12,602 --> 01:16:14,969
<i>To be parted.</i>

1167
01:16:14,971 --> 01:16:18,205
<i>I can't believe it, really.</i>

1168
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:21,943
<i>We had so many adventures
still ahead of us.</i>

1169
01:16:21,945 --> 01:16:24,946
<i>Maybe... if we had had more time</i>

1170
01:16:24,948 --> 01:16:26,814
<i>I would have found
something about you</i>

1171
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:30,184
<i>I didn't like,
really couldn't stand</i>

1172
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:33,087
<i>which would be very useful
right now.</i>

1173
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,756
<i>But I doubt it.</i>

1174
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:39,660
<i>They say that
no love is perfect.</i>

1175
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:42,830
<i>But then, they never met you.</i>

1176
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:45,366
<i>Arielle.</i>

1177
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:53,134
Let me help.
No, it's okay.

1178
01:17:53,136 --> 01:17:55,736
But if I may impose
for a favor?

1179
01:17:55,738 --> 01:17:57,738
Sir.

1180
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,074
Please give this
to Madam Pierpont

1181
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:03,077
when she comes
for lunch on Friday.

1182
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:05,112
Certainly, sir.

1183
01:18:05,114 --> 01:18:06,347
Thank you.

1184
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,448
<i>I did as she asked.</i>

1185
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:16,817
<i>I didn't try to contact her.</i>

1186
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:19,820
<i>I stayed out of
her neighborhood.</i>

1187
01:19:19,822 --> 01:19:23,357
<i>I never returned
to the St. Regis.</i>

1188
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,093
<i>If my route was
to take me near it</i>

1189
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,929
<i>I would go a couple of blocks
out of my way.</i>

1190
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,195
Yes?

1191
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,965
<i>It's just me. Jane.</i>

1192
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,546
How is she?

1193
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:27,648
I have no idea.

1194
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:31,585
What do you mean?

1195
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,457
I ended it with Valery.

1196
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:37,958
Why?

1197
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:42,496
Because there is a certain
sadness to it now.

1198
01:21:42,498 --> 01:21:45,099
Because being around him
and around her

1199
01:21:45,101 --> 01:21:48,335
feels like I'm betraying
my friendship with you.

1200
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:51,639
You're not.
Not anymore.

1201
01:21:51,641 --> 01:21:54,108
And because..

1202
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,680
...the future has a way
of arriving

1203
01:21:59,682 --> 01:22:02,116
whether you want it to or not.

1204
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:08,289
Eat something.

1205
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:10,090
Smoke less.

1206
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:19,233
Call me.
We'll go to the movies.

1207
01:22:19,235 --> 01:22:21,936
Something from
a big American studio.

1208
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:27,735
<i>As little as you want
to write when you're happy</i>

1209
01:23:27,737 --> 01:23:31,238
<i>that's how much you have to
write when you're miserable.</i>

1210
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,474
<i>Your passions
have to go somewhere</i>

1211
01:23:33,476 --> 01:23:36,610
<i>and this is
the only place left.</i>

1212
01:23:36,612 --> 01:23:38,772
<i>Your suffering has to be
good for something.</i>

1213
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:47,755
<i>It's not for me to say if
the words were worth the price.</i>

1214
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,101
What are you doing?
Where are we going?

1215
01:24:01,103 --> 01:24:03,170
Just wait a minute.

1216
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,138
Smile, you asshole. Smile.

1217
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:53,654
Come on. Come on,
we're celebrating.

1218
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:56,617
<i>Thousands of years ago</i>

1219
01:25:56,619 --> 01:26:00,888
<i>somebody came up with
the notion of impermanence.</i>

1220
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:04,858
<i>Of the beauty
and inevitability of change.</i>

1221
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:08,914
<i>I'm pretty sure
they had just been dumped.</i>

1222
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:15,335
<i>I had a long time to consider
the value of memory.</i>

1223
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:18,372
<i>And the idea that just because
something doesn't last forever</i>

1224
01:26:18,374 --> 01:26:21,508
<i>doesn't mean
its worth is diminished.</i>

1225
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:24,711
<i>Maybe it was just
a rationalization.</i>

1226
01:26:24,713 --> 01:26:27,681
<i>Easier on the soul than
mourning what might have been.</i>

1227
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:29,883
<i>A life unlived.</i>

1228
01:26:29,885 --> 01:26:31,418
<i>I honestly don't know.</i>

1229
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:34,955
<i>But I chose
to believe in memory.</i>

1230
01:26:34,957 --> 01:26:38,825
<i>I chose to believe in her.</i>

1231
01:26:38,827 --> 01:26:41,728
<i>I chose to believe
that the bond was never broken</i>

1232
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:43,864
<i>and that we carried each other
in our hearts.</i>

1233
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,367
<i>As a secret singularity.</i>

1234
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:50,938
<i>She made me a writer.</i>

1235
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:54,341
<i>She made me a man.</i>

1236
01:26:54,343 --> 01:26:57,511
<i>There would be other loves,
even great loves.</i>

1237
01:26:58,546 --> 01:26:59,680
<i>But she was right.</i>

1238
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:04,518
<i>Only one remained perfect.</i>

1239
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:17,898
I'm gonna get a kick
out of that.

1240
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,834
Carol tells me that she's

1241
01:27:20,836 --> 01:27:24,271
she's deciding to take
her work vacation.

1242
01:27:24,273 --> 01:27:25,973
<i>Which she has.</i>
Of course she has.

1243
01:27:25,975 --> 01:27:28,942
<i>And as a result,
it never quite left me alone.</i>

1244
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:47,561
...like, you have to try...

1245
01:27:47,563 --> 01:27:51,265
<i>I wondered if it remained
perfect for her as well.</i>

1246
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:54,268
<i>Or if I was just
holding onto an idea.</i>

1247
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:59,773
<i>Some questions
have to go unanswered.</i>

1248
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:02,776
<i>But in New York, you're never
more than 20 feet away</i>

1249
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:05,445
<i>from someone you know</i>

1250
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:07,407
<i>or someone you were
meant to know.</i>

1251
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:42,268
Hi.
Hi.

1252
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:46,920
Brian, lovely to see you.
Valery, how are you?

1253
01:28:46,922 --> 01:28:49,356
Nice to see<i> you.</i>
This is Kiva.

1254
01:28:49,358 --> 01:28:50,924
How are you?
Hello, I'm Valery.

1255
01:28:50,926 --> 01:28:52,559
Nice to meet you.
And you.

1256
01:28:52,561 --> 01:28:54,661
Very nice to meet you.
Marc.

1257
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:57,597
And our children,
Marc and Elodie.

1258
01:28:57,599 --> 01:28:58,999
<i>And?</i>

1259
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:03,103
This is Charlie Bloom.
Hi, Charlie.

1260
01:29:03,105 --> 01:29:05,605
Wanna say hi, Charlie?
Hello, Charlie.

1261
01:29:05,607 --> 01:29:09,042
He's two, right?
Yeah, he's... he is two.

1262
01:29:09,044 --> 01:29:11,378
<i>Not talking much yet.</i>

1263
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:15,015
I loved "The Mermaid."

1264
01:29:15,017 --> 01:29:19,119
<i>Oh, yes, so did I. And I must
say, all of your books.</i>

1265
01:29:19,121 --> 01:29:22,489
Yes, we read you religiously
in our home.

1266
01:29:22,491 --> 01:29:24,791
Thank you.
I'm very glad about that.

1267
01:29:26,594 --> 01:29:28,662
Tell me, how... how is Jane?

1268
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:30,964
Jane is brilliant.

1269
01:29:30,966 --> 01:29:33,834
Jane is Jane.

1270
01:29:33,836 --> 01:29:35,035
She is married.

1271
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:38,071
She met a very good guy,
a cellist.

1272
01:29:38,073 --> 01:29:40,640
And they have a son.

1273
01:29:40,642 --> 01:29:42,876
<i>Oh, that's wonderful.</i>

1274
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:45,879
<i>And tell me, Mrs. Bloom,
apart from being the mother</i>

1275
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:48,749
<i>of this beautiful..</i>

1276
01:30:21,717 --> 01:30:23,483
Brian.

1277
01:30:23,485 --> 01:30:24,718
Take care...
Take care. Bye-bye.

1278
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,520
So nice to meet you.

1279
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:28,855
Bye.

1280
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:50,911
<i>I don't know
if I'll ever see her again.</i>

1281
01:30:50,913 --> 01:30:52,946
<i>I don't know
if that's a good thing</i>

1282
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:54,114
<i>or a bad one.</i>

1283
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:59,586
<i>But I will promise you this.</i>

1284
01:30:59,588 --> 01:31:03,890
<i>Your favorite story,
whatever it might be</i>

1285
01:31:03,892 --> 01:31:06,760
<i>was written for one reader.</i>
