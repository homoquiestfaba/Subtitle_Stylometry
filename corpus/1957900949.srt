Bye now.

26
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,562
Speaking of holiday cheer,
you sure look full of it.

27
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,565
Yeah, I'm just thankful that we
planned these articles a year out.

28
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,485
But you've still got to have your
pitch for the meeting tomorrow.

29
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,946
Remember, the feature and the
cover are on the line here.

30
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,324
Thank you for
the added layer of pressure.

31
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,076
Not that I needed it.

32
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,578
I'm just sayin',
after Daniel's cover story

33
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,914
about the history
of <i>The Nutcracker</i> last year,

34
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,499
it got a lot of eyes, hon.

35
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,919
And Daniel got a book deal.
I know. Be like Daniel.

36
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,796
Be like Daniel.

37
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,130
Ha!

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,760
All right, guys, tomorrow
morning, uh, 8:30 a.m. sharp,

39
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,971
but I gotta say I need
a little more nuance.

40
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,598
You know, a little more flair.

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,810
I need our readers to have
an experience on the page,

42
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,187
'cause if they can't travel
the world for Christmas,

43
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,439
we're going to bring
Christmas to them, okay?

44
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,942
Youse got it?
All right, I know you do.

45
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,236
Don't let me down.

46
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,864
It just seems like every
Christmas tradition on the planet

47
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,301
has already been covered already...
I mean, Christmas wedding, done.

48
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,618
Christmas on the ranch?
Done.

49
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,995
Do you want
a Christmas cruise? Done.

50
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,956
There isn't
a gingerbread competition,

51
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,292
a quaint village or a tree
lighting we haven't explored.

52
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,253
- What else is left?
- Christmas in space?

53
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,463
Do you think I could do it?

54
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,632
Look, maybe you're thinking
too globally here.

55
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,010
Girl, the holidays are
all about family.

56
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,470
Maybe you should try
looking closer to home?

57
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,930
Oh, yeah, yeah.

58
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,391
I'm sure the readers would love
to hear about my parents

59
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:25,478
struggling to take the Christmas
decorations down from the attic.

60
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,148
Speaking of which,
I promised I would go help them

61
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,900
later tonight, so...

62
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,987
I'm going to go grab
some leftovers from the party

63
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,238
and head out.

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,240
Oh, lots of missed calls.

65
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,702
See? Family time.

66
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,496
Who knows? Maybe
you'll get some inspiration.

67
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,751
I don't need inspiration,
I need a Christmas miracle.

68
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,837
Go on and get
that Christmas miracle, girl.

69
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,339
Thank you.

70
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,011

- I got coffee.
- Ah, bless you.

87
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,945
I thought the coffee
would never get here.

88
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,154
And you, of course.

89
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,073
But mostly the coffee.

90
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,825

- Mm-hmm.
- Don't get too cozy.

95
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,213
We can't take a break
until everything's down.

96
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,215
She's so bossy.

97
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,551
Hey, it was your idea
to get a jump start

98
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,094
on clearing out the attic.

99
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,929
Remind me to keep my mouth shut.

100
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,726
Mm!

101
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,527
Oh, no, no, no,
we did beach Santa last year.

102
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,688
Let's do, uh,
Vegas Santa this year.

103
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,732
- Right.
- I don't want to keep you too late,

104
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,693

have a pitch to write.

106
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,659
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah?

107
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:49,330
Do you mind if I take
this Campbell box home with me?

108
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,091
Hi, Everett.

109
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,855
Can you get that, hon?

110
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,650
It's probably the Pere Noel
Festival planning committee!

111
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,488
Bergeron residence.
Everett speaking.

112
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,200

- Here you go.
- Oh.

Hello.

00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:25,051

This is, uh, Campbell Wallace.

121
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,720
<i>You left me a voicemail?</i>

122
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,013
Yes, of course!

123
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,932
Uh... can you give me a minute?

124
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,559
Christmas emergency.

125
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,602
Um, you can start without me,
I'll be right there.

126
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,687
Sure.

127
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,112
Well, um...

128
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,363
hi there, Campbell.

129
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,574
<i>Uh, this is, um...</i>

130
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,285
Well, I'm just so glad
that you called.

131
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,705
Yeah, well,
you left me a voicemail.

132
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,499
Oh, and my letter
a few months ago?

133
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,084
What... How did you find me?

134
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,711
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

135
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,379
I kept looking
for an Alice Bergeron

136
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,089
because that's what
he calls you, but...

137
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,383
Yeah, there were five Alices
in my preschool

138
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,053
and my dad gave me
the nickname, so...

139
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,679
<i>"Campbell" just kind of stuck.</i>

140
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,932
Well, um, took me
a while, but...

141
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,642
eventually I got there.

142
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:19,064
It's amazing what you can find
online these days, right?

143
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,150
I know that I may be
overstepping here, and...

144
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,278
<i>when you didn't answer my letter,
I figured I should just leave it be.</i>

145
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,197
Then why didn't you?

146
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,323
<i>Well, um...</i>

147
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,283
here in Ascension Parish

148
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,286
fires on the levee light... they
light the way for Pere Noel,

149
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,871
<i>Santa Claus, you know,</i>

150
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,957
and our old Pere Noel
has retired

151
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,627
and Everett has been chosen
to replace him.

152
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,921
- Okay.
<i>- And...</i>

153
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,881
it's a big deal.

154
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,468
<i>It's an honor that you want
to share with your family,</i>

155
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,762
and I guess what
I'm trying to say is

156
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,099
that ever since
he's been chosen...

157
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,727
he... he just doesn't think
he deserves it because...

158
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,147
he can't stop
thinking about you.

159
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,067
<i>I don't know.</i>

160
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:08,154
I thought, well, this
is sort of my Hail Mary pass,

161
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,865
<i>- to see if...</i>
- It's a really nice offer,

162
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,909
uh, but I've been fine
without him

163
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,869
<i>most of my life,
so, um, thank you, but...</i>

164
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,746
Mom, dinner's getting cold.

165
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,998
Yeah, come on.
We wanna make Christmas cookies!

166
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,667
Just a minute, girls.

167
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,669
Who... Who was that?

168
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,755
Oh, Mary-Margaret and Amelia.
They would be...

169
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,258
Well, um...

170
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,678
<i>they're your sisters.</i>

171
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,413
Oh, focus, um...

172
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,789
Okay.

173
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,834
Feature...

174
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,002
All right, guys, I am loving the
international angle right now.

175
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,755
Let's run with that. Oh, and the
Christmas Barbecue Cook-Off...

176
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,841
- Oh. Hello, Campbell.
- Sorry.

177
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,052
Nice of you to join us.
Um, anyway, uh...

178
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,262
Oh, the Dallas piece
for the Christmas Cook-Off.

179
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,806
Fantastic.

180
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,975
But for this feature
I'm looking for something,

181
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,269
something with
a bit more culture,

182
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,604
you know, a bit more heart,

183
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,564
something that we haven't
seen before...

184
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,608
What's that?

185
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,443
- Oh, uh, no.
- What's this?

186
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,613
- Nope, that's...
- Oh, this is fantastic.

187
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,615
Are you ready to pitch this?

188
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,702
- Yeah.
- Let's see this pitch.

189
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,829
Give Campbell the floor, guys.
All right.

190
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,081
Yep.

191
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,958
Uh... okay.

192
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,960
So...

193
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,170
there's this town in Louisiana

194
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,089
called Sorrento,

195
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,883
uh, where the people try
to make Christmas special,

196
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,094
even though there's no snow.

197
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:40,765
And so, on Christmas Eve,
they light the bayou

198
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,977
to guide Pere Noel,
their version of Santa Claus,

199
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,770
to their homes.

200
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,357
And this year,
the new Pere Noel is a man

201
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,860
named Everett Bergeron.

202
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,987
He's a successful businessman.

203
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,239
Runs a popular meat pie shop...

204
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,325
Right, right, but who is he?

205
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,037
Um...

206
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,206
I mean, I guess that
would be the story, really,

207
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,292
figuring that out.

208
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,626
I like it.

209
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,086
Good job.

210
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,054
So, I'm thinking
we finish decorating the tree,

211
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,348
make some hot chocolate, and...

212
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,184
ride around the neighborhood
and look at the lights.

213
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,686
Way ahead of you
on the hot chocolate part.

214
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,855
Gary!
That was for later.

215
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,567
I'm a simple man, Sarah.
I see hot chocolate, I drink it.

216
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,320
So... somebody had
a big meeting today.

217
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,239
And somebody is being
very quiet about it.

218
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,575
Uh, yeah. It was good.

219
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,869
I'm in contention
for the feature.

220
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,954
Well, what are we doing
drinking hot chocolate?

221
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,664
We should pop open
the champagne!

222
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,375
It's nothing yet.

223
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,793
And, um...

224
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,920
it does mean that
I'm leaving tomorrow

225
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,548
and that I won't see you two
on Christmas morning.

226
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,925
Landing the feature!

227
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,927
Almost landing the feature.

228
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,721
Well, almost landing
the feature is a big deal.

229
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,349
When we open presents isn't.

230
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,017
Now, tell us everything.

231
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,021
Okay, uh...

232
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,817
There's this small town
in Louisiana

233
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,362
where they ask a man
in the town to be, like,

234
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,572
their version of Santa Claus.

235
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,991
Louisiana?

236
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,371
Ascension Parish, actually.

237
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,039
Sorrento.

238
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,419
So... you want
to meet your father.

239
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,713
Well, no.

240
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,798
Yes?

241
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,925
I just...

242
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,803
I feel like going
is the right thing to do.

243
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,014
When you were 13,
we sat you down

244
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,182
and we asked you
if you wanted to meet him,

245
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,519
if you wanted to have a relationship
with him, and you said that you...

246
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,479
I said it was his loss
when he left

247
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,398
and I have all the family
I need.

248
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,234
That hasn't changed.

249
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,612
Well, I'm not trying to hold you
to what you wanted as a child.

250
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,282
But I do wonder, why now?

251
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,952
Mama, I have sisters.

252
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,792
And I do wonder about him.

253
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,085
You know?

254
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,629
I think that
if I don't do this now,

255
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,214
I always will.

256
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:23,136
I just don't want you
to get hurt, that's all.

257
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,013
I know.

258
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,017
I...

259
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,519
Will you excuse me?

260
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,825
You aren't mad at me, are you?

261
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:49,371
Or upset that
I would want to meet him?

262
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:52,165
Why would I be mad?

263
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,959
You are my dad.
And you're a great dad.

264
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,420
Campbell, it's okay.

265
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,340
I know you love me.

266
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:04,511
And honestly, I had a feeling
this day would come.

267
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,556
And what about Mom?

268
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,517
Is this what you want, kiddo?

269
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,604
Yeah. It is.

270
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,690
Then she'll come around.

271
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,942
I promise.

272
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,861
Yeah.

273
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,030
Let's finish
decorating the tree.

274
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,282
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- Yes.

275
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,909
Coming.

276
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:04,195
Campbell. It's so nice
to finally meet you.

277
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,659
- Do we hug?
- Yeah, sure.

278
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,203
Okay.

279
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,414
I'm sorry, I'm just so excited.

280
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:17,876
I've been hearing about you,
well, since I met your father,

281
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,128
so... 20 years?

282
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,007
- And here you are!
- Here I am.

283
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,718
Um, he's running errands
and the girls are at school.

284
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,637
I thought it would be nice
if it was just us for a minute.

285
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,556
- Great. Thank you.
- Yeah.

286
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,267
So, you'll be staying down the
road at a cute little cottage

287
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,478
owned by friends of ours,
the Shepherds.

288
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,896
Oh, the Shepherds,

289
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,148
they don't know that
I'm Everett's daughter?

290
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,777
No, no, no, no. No.
That's yours to tell, not mine.

291
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,612
But they do know
about the article,

292
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,614
and we're going to give you
a lot to write about.

293
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,825
Mr. Shepherd is the Pere Noel
who's stepping down

294
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,787
and his grandson Jackson
is the town liaison,

295
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,622
so he can help you out too.

296
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,540
- Great.
- But, uh, look.

297
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,335
If it gets too much and you feel
like you need to leave...

298
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,296
Jennifer? I...
I'll be all right.

299
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,798
Don't worry.

300
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,800
That's what moms do, I guess.
We worry.

301
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,469
But you're right, um...

302
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,179
So, uh...

303
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,223
Come on inside.
I got that.

304
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,808
- And I'll show you...
- Thank you.

305
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,309
Show you the house.

306
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,811
So this is it.

307
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,312
So, as you can see,

308
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,190
we do like to decorate
for the holidays.

309
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,278
Yeah, those. Uh...

310
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,948
We started making pecan hand
pies one year for Christmas,

311
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:34,411
and ever since then, we keep
thinking we need help shelling them.

312
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:38,998
Don't worry about it. We collect,
um, novelty Santas back home.

313
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,583
Um, can I get you anything?

314
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,295
It is Christmas,
so eggnog or hot cocoa or...

315
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,090
- Any water?
- I can manage that, yes.

316
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,426
Be back in a minute.
You just make yourself at home.

317
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,352
I did have an idea.

318
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:03,106
You know, if you're not sure
that you want to come out

319
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,524
and tell Everett who you are?

320
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,192
Yeah?

321
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,778
Well, since you're
already doing the article,

322
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,199
maybe you could
use that as a cover?

323
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,785
You know,
observe him, get to know him,

324
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,705
and tell him when you're ready.

325
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,457
Isn't that a little dishonest?

326
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:24,085
Well, I'm not saying that I feel
great about the idea, but...

327
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,296
I mean, I came
all the way here, right?

328
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,798
I should be able to look him in
the eye and tell him who I am.

329
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,216
Well, of course.

330
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:31,760
You know, I understand,
though, if...

331
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,888
- Jennifer, are you here?
- Oh, um...

332
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,265
Sure am, darling!

333
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,017
And, uh, we have some company.

334
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,602
Company?

335
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,189
Hello there.

336
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,195
This is Campbell Wallace.

337
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,822
Ah, Everett Bergeron.

338
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:55,658
Nice to meet you. Welcome.

339
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,079
Um, it's a little complicated
to explain, but she's...

340
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,123
A reporter.

341
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,251
Uh, yeah, I'm here to write
a story about you

342
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,379
for <i>Airvent</i> magazine.

343
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,547
Nothing complicated about it.

344
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,466
Okay.

345
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,143
So, you're a reporter?

346
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,561
Huh?

347
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,064
- Surprise!
- Yeah, it sure is.

348
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,899
Uh, what'd you say
your name was again?

349
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,652
- Campbell Wallace.
- Uh-huh.

350
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:34,447
Um, your wife tipped me off
about you becoming

351
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,032
Sorrento's new Pere Noel,

352
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,118
and we think our readers
will love it.

353
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,497
Well, look, I'm not much of a story, but...
you're the expert.

354
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,499
No, you really should
read her articles.

355
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,085
- Okay.
- Um, she's been everywhere.

356
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,921
- A real world traveler.
- Sure, yeah, yes.

357
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,256
Um...

358
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,133
And when I cover these things,

359
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,885
I get... I get to know the town

360
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,013
and, uh, the traditions,

361
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,681
and, uh, well, and this time,

362
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,349
the man behind
the big white beard.

363
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,644
And actually, because the honor

364
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,105
is about you and your family,

365
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,816
I would like to get
to know both.

366
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,443
If you'll let me.

367
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,363
Well...

368
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,240
all right, Campbell.

369
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,117
Uh, it sounds fine.

370
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,827
I just hope I don't
disappoint you.

371
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,039
Yeah, I hope so, too.

372
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,208
Uh, I gotta git... a whole new
batch of orders came in.

373
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,960
- Oh, for the meat pie business?
- Yep.

374
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,754
This is the busiest time
of year.

375
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,423
Seems like every town in a
25-mile radius orders from us,

376
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,633
and we ship
all over the country.

377
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,886
Stick around,
I'll show you how we make them.

378
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,804
- I would like that.
- Yeah.

379
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,265
Honey bun. Hey, the mayor's
party, you got that covered?

380
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,101
Yes. I'll get the delivery going
when the girls get home from school.

381
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,687
All right.

382
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,523
"When out on the roof,

383
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,360
there arose such a clatter..."

384
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,781
- We're home! Hello?
- Hello.

385
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,366
Hey, there they are!

386
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:03,036
How are my best girls?
How you doin'?

387
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,663
- Wow. Father of the year.
- How was your last day of school?

388
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,665
He's made lots of mistakes,

389
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,919
but I know that he would really
like to make it right with you.

390
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,671
Listen,
I gotta fill some orders,

391
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,714
so please
take care of your mom, okay?

392
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,883
Be nice, we have a visitor!

393
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,473
Hi! Dad says not to be nightmares
because we have a guest.

394
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:24,933
I'm guessing that's you?

395
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,768
Hi, I'm Campbell.
It's nice to meet you.

396
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,979
I'm Amelia.
This is Mary-Margaret.

397
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:34,317
Um, Campbell is doing an article
on Pere Noel for A <i>irvent </i>magazine.

398
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,819
- Yeah.
- Oh, great.

399
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,696
Love to spend Christmas break
with strangers.

400
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,490
- Mary-Margaret!
- It's okay, I get it.

401
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,909
Um... I probably wouldn't
want to spend Christmas

402
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,346
with someone who writes for an
airplane magazine, either, so...

403
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,932
Wait, you mean the ones that they
give out with the little peanut bags?

404
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,458
Yeah, the... the one
with the peanut bags.

405
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,794
- That's cool.
- Yeah. You know what else is cool?

406
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,588
Uh, Mom, we know what's cool
way more than you do.

407
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,465
- Yeah, we're tastemakers.
- Oh.

408
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:00,427
Well, how do the tastemakers
feel about chores?

409
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:05,724
Um, chores are not trending
right now, so...

410
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,809
It's good PR for the business.

411
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,311
Mary-Margaret
runs all of our socials.

412
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:13,189
She's, uh,
quite the content creator.

413
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,774
Kind of like you.

414
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,901
Fine. But only for the 'gram.

415
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,529
Well, then it's settled.
Catering delivery.

416
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,448
So, off. Put on your shirts.

417
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,908
- All right, okay.
- All right, you too. Go, go!

418
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,370
So, would you like to join us?

419
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,622
- Sure. I would love to.
- Great. Come on.

420
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:36,421
Let's go, girls!
We're leaving in ten minutes!

421
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,965
Hey.
They put you to work already?

422
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,176
Oh, don't worry.
I'm a very immersive writer.

423
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,719
I like to get in the trenches,

424
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,055
or the Christmas parties,
as the case may be.

425
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:48,308
Okay. So, is this the part
where, I don't know,

426
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,894
you ask what Pere Noel
means to me

427
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,146
or my top five
Christmas cookies?

428
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:56,524
Oh, you know, well, I have got
so many questions for you,

429
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,193
you wouldn't even believe.

430
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,278
Well, where do we start, then?

431
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,948
Uh, what about your girls?
Your daughters?

432
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,492
My daughters?

433
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,161
It's quite a brood
you've got there.

434
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,957
Oh, yeah. Well...

435
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,334
they're my everything.

436
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,086
I couldn't imagine life
without them.

437
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,173
Campbell! Come on!

438
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:22,425
- Oh.
- Good luck. You'll need it.

439
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,094
Thank you.

440
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,934
So, you're a writer, huh?

441
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,229
Uh, yeah.
I take pictures, too. See?

442
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,647
Cool.

443
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,816
- Wow, nice.
- You wanna try?

444
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,192
Um, sure.

445
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,779
Uh-uh.

446
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,073
Whoo-whoo.

447
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,366
So, what do you write about?

448
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:47,659
Um...

449
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,203
<i>Je suis une auteure de voyage.</i>

450
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,290
That's French for
"I'm a travel writer."

451
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:55,959
- Oh.
- Oh!

452
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,336
And what's French for
"Pere Noel's going to bring me

453
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,005
a big lump of coal
for Christmas"?

454
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,899
Pere Noel doesn't
even bring coal, that's Santa.

455
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,134
- Mm-hmm. There's a difference?
- Oh, yeah.

456
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:07,095
See, Pere Noel is Cajun,
so he speaks French too.

457
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:10,348
Oh, and he drinks blackberry
wine and eats meat pies.

458
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,827
And my dad is going to be him now
that Mr. Shepherd is retiring.

459
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,562
Yes. I've heard about that.
I've been told.

460
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,397
- Okay, buckle up.
- Smile, Mom.

461
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,524
- Oh...
- Oh, and by the way,

462
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,401
we're going
to Robert's Coffee House

463
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,694
and my dad used to work there,

464
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:25,447
and they have
the best beignets, ever.

465
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,742
- Okay. Beignets, meat pies.
- Mm-hmm.

466
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,327
- Okay, so you're ready to do the whole tour?
- Yeah.

467
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,163
- Let's do it, Mom.
- Let's do this.

468
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,046
- I can come back out for those.
- Oh, no, don't worry.

469
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:44,049
I can get them. I mean,
it's a family business, right?

470
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,091
Right.

471
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,561
Oh! <i>Attention!</i>

472
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,438
Whoops.

473
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,190
- Well, that's broken.
- I'm so sorry.

474
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,150
You know, a warning
might have been nice.

475
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,420
- You don't speak French?
- That's the problem with tourists.

476
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,339
They come through and mess up
the flow of traffic.

477
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,448
Yeah, well, no wonder
you're mowing people over.

478
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,991
- Do you mind if I...? Yep.
- Oh.

479
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:10,950
Thank you.

480
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,744
So, she knocks over my presents,

481
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,287
she makes fun
of my nerdy glasses...

482
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,206
Well, from one nerd to another,

483
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,415
I think they look cute.

484
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,376
Um... distinguished.

485
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,002
Smart...

486
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,087
I mean.

487
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:24,923
- But not well-traveled.
- No.

488
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,424
Campbell!
We're setting up.

489
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,760
Yeah, I'm on my way!

490
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,432
<i>♪ You bring out
The holly jolly me... ♪</i>

491
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,436
Okay, good,
if you could tilt it up

492
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,105
towards the Christmas tree.

493
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,648
Yeah.

494
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,943
Okay. Good. Perfect.

495
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,695
Caption time.

496
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,739
I need to find a pen.
Gotta brainstorm.

497
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,283
Oh, Amelia, not on any
of the mayor's important stuff.

498
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,535
Wait, wait, wait!

499
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,870
- Mayor Thomas.
- Yes.

500
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,956
Mayor Thomas,
this is Campbell Wallace.

501
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,166
She's doing the article
about Pere Noel.

502
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,626
Oh, okay.

503
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,753
The mayor
and Everett go way back.

504
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,272
Campbell,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

505
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:08,466
- And welcome to Sorrento!
- Thank you. Nice to be here.

506
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:12,721
Absolutely. You know, I think
she should meet Jackson Shepherd.

507
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,806
I think he'd be
a great resource for you.

508
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,392
Actually, she's staying
at his family's cottage.

509
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:19,853
Ah, there you go.
Meant to be.

510
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:22,480
He's around here somewhere.

511
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,274
Hey, Jackson!

512
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,861
Come over here!

513
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:33,241
Jackson Shepherd,
this is Campbell Wallace.

514
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:35,660
She's the reporter
from the travel magazine.

515
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,370
Ah. Well, <i>bonjour,</i>miss.

516
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,664
<i>Bonjour</i> indeed.

517
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:42,375
Oh, Mayor Thomas, if you're
wondering why the present I got you

518
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:46,838
is broken into a million pieces,
that's because of her.

519
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,591
Well, Campbell,
you can ask this rude young man

520
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,843
anything about anything,
he knows it all.

521
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:53,845
He's the keeper
of all the town records

522
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,555
and he helps us out
when we have visitors.

523
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:56,848
- Great.
- Okay.

524
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,242
I just hope I don't
ruin your flow,

525
00:25:58,266 --> 00:25:59,768
what with me
being a tourist, and all.

526
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,853
Well, it was her who started.

527
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,356
I mean, I feel like you
started that before.

528
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,483
- And you'll be staying at the cottage?
- Yeah.

529
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:09,402
- Excellent.
- I can't tell if they're flirting or fighting.

530
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:11,988
- Maybe both.
- That's why I put her in the cottage.

531
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,698
You're good with people,
you know that?

532
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,492
Well, it's a gift.
What can I say?

533
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:20,538
So, Jennifer, I wanted to ask,

534
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,208
what's Everett like, to you?

535
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,959
Um, well...

536
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,170
he's smart and hard-working.

537
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,005
And loving.

538
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,382
Um...

539
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,050
You know, when I met him,

540
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:35,261
he had just pulled himself
out of a really dark place.

541
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:41,059
And he's spent the rest of his life
trying to do better, be better.

542
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:45,313
There's not a lot of people
you can say that about.

543
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:48,733
And, you know,
he makes me laugh... a lot.

544
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:52,195
Tsk... I think
I just love him to bits.

545
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:56,366
Yeah, see, I wish I could
see him the way all of you do.

546
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:59,452
And I wish he could have been
those things for me.

547
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,247
- Hey!
- Hey.

548
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,581
Perfect timing.

549
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,417
I just set out
the last batch to cool.

550
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:06,876
- Good day?
- Excellent.

551
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,420
I'm thinking of hiring Campbell.

552
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,880
She's a perfect fit
for our little operation here.

553
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:12,590
- Okay.
- How was your day?

554
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,759
Well, much better
now that you're here.

555
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,177
- Oh.
- Come on, let's eat.

556
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,947
- Well, well, well, okay.
- You too, Campbell.

557
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,765
- Campbell. Come on now.
- Yep.

558
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,767
All right.
Ooh, something smells good.

559
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,770
- Mmm.
- Girls, come on, dinner!

560
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:29,065
I'm just gonna grab my things
and head out.

561
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,401
You can't leave yet.
Stay for dinner.

562
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:33,194
Look, there's plenty of food.

563
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:35,947
I just... I should really get
started on writing my article,

564
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,366
and I don't want to intrude
on family time.

565
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,827
Guess what? After dinner,
we're making wreaths.

566
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,288
It's a family tradition
on the first night off school.

567
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,224
- You can sit by me.
- Uh-uh, she's sitting by me.

568
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:46,958
We're going
to talk about photography.

569
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,878
Sounds like the girls
already saved a spot for you.

570
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,297
Now, look, this article
is about me, right?

571
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,549
Well, to know my family
<i>is</i> to know me.

572
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,053
Why don't you stay awhile?

573
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:00,889
How can I say no?

574
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,449
You can just put your stuff
on the chair.

575
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:05,685
Thank you.

576
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:08,063
- Mm-mm. Who's first?
- Smells good.

577
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:09,606
For you.

578
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:21,201
"This will be
your best Christmas ever."

579
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:24,245
Hi, Mom.

580
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:26,122
<i>Hey, baby.
How are you holding up?</i>

581
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:28,375
Uh... getting settled in.

582
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,293
You know, meeting my father
for the first time,

583
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,295
not telling him
I'm his daughter.

584
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:35,006
- You haven't told him yet?
<i>- I panicked.</i>

585
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,425
Well, that's totally normal,
sweetheart.

586
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,718
<i>It still feels weird.</i>

587
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,303
It's kind of like lying,
you know?

588
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:43,139
I mean, it's...
a lot like lying.

589
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,642
<i>Well, it's also a way
of keeping yourself safe</i>

590
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,727
and get to know him better.

591
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,020
How are the girls?

592
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,647
Oh, Mom, they're amazing.

593
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,566
I mean, Amelia is so spunky,

594
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:56,986
and Mary-Margaret
is just such a moody teenager.

595
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:59,614
You know, she's trying
to be real cool.

596
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:02,450
She just, like, reminds me a lot
of myself when I was that age.

597
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,953
And last night we were making
wreaths, and, um...

598
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:08,665
Oh, hang on, Mom.
Someone's at my door.

599
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:10,792
It's okay. Go.
Just call me later.

600
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:11,918
I love you!

601
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,211
Love you.

602
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:21,469
Well, look who
the reindeer dragged in.

603
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:23,680
Pere Noel doesn't
actually have reindeer.

604
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:25,432
Oh, yeah?
What does he use, then?

605
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:26,891
Alligators.

606
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:29,811
Oh. The Ayutthaya province
has elephants,

607
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:33,648
the North Pole has reindeers, and Cajun
country has alligators, naturally.

608
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,320
Oh, right. Sorry.

609
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:41,823
Uh, so, your coffee machine
here is broken,

610
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:43,533
so I brought you this.

611
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:45,285
My grandma's recipe.

612
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,328
I hope you like
Cajun eggnog flavor.

613
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,955
Cajun eggnog. Never had it.

614
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,416
Ah. That's a point for me then.

615
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,352
I mean, essentially
it's eggnog instead of creamer,

616
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:56,129
with nutmeg, cinnamon, cayenne,

617
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,964
and a little
imitation rum extract.

618
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,966
Sounds different.

619
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,010
It's a southern
Louisiana tradition, so...

620
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:03,511
Mmm, don't worry,
I love different.

621
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:06,848
Believe me, in my line of work,
I get plenty of it.

622
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,267
- Ever had mopane?
- I have not.

623
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:11,853
- What is that?
- Worms.

624
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,855
It's a Zimbabwean
Christmas tradition.

625
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:16,149
That sounds... delicious.

626
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,443
It's actually pretty good.
Almost as good as this coffee.

627
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:20,028
Glad to hear it.

628
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,447
Hey, I was thinking,
maybe I'd take you on a tour?

629
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:25,200
You can see the sights.
I mean, it's no Zimbabwe...

630
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,369
Actually, I'm tailing
Everett today,

631
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:30,038
Pere Noel duties,
but maybe you could help me

632
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,456
do some research after lunch?

633
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:33,792
Sorrento's resident geek
is at your service.

634
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,710
Great, it's a date then.

635
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:37,045
Um...

636
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:38,338
Yeah, cheers.

637
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,589
Cheers.

638
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,429
You know, it's a great honor
to take on the mantle

639
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:48,139
of Pere Noel from Shepherd here,

640
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:51,017
who's had that distinction
for nearly 30 years.

641
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:56,648
Now, as my first official act
as Sorrento's new Pere Noel,

642
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,402
I'm going to hang the first
ornament on the town tree,

643
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:03,446
as a sign that Christmas
is just around the corner.

644
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:09,285
Hey, you know,
this is the time of year

645
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:12,247
where we're supposed to be the
most hospitable and welcoming,

646
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,749
so I'd like to ask
somebody else to help me.

647
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:18,920
Kind of an honorary Pere Noel
assistant for the season.

648
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:21,423
Campbell Wallace.
What do you say?

649
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:22,799
- Uh...
- Go on!

650
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:24,175
Okay, sure.

651
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:25,343
- Thank you.
- Anywhere.

652
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,928
- Right here? Yeah?
- Yep.

653
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,139
- Okay.
- There we go. Ta-da!

654
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,851
You didn't have to do that.

655
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,394
Of course I did.
You're our guest.

656
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:36,312
All right, folks join in!

657
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:57,042
"Mo' fassa and fassa,
da gator dey came!"

658
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:01,338
"He whistle and holla
and called dem by name!"

659
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:04,799
Hey, now, kids,
we have a special visitor,

660
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:07,844
coming all the way from the
magical land of Dallas, Texas.

661
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:09,304
- Oooh!
- Now, I reckon she's never

662
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:11,556
even heard this story before,
have you?

663
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:14,059
I can't say that I have.
Not this version, anyway.

664
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,563
Well then, she doesn't even know
the names of Pere Noel's gators.

665
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:20,982
Should we teach her? Y'all
want to practice your reading?

666
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:22,359
Yeah!

667
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,735
All right, come on up here.

668
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:25,445
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

669
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:29,491
- Right here. You ready?
- Okay.

670
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:30,325
Here we go.

671
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:33,661
"Ha, Gaston! Ha, Tiboy!"

672
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:36,122
"Ha, Pierre an' Alcee!"

673
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,750
"Gee, Ninette! Gee, Suzette!"

674
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,544
"Celeste an' Renee!"

675
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:46,192
- Not my best performance.
- Oh, that's all right.

676
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:48,218
Look, that's for you.
Now you can practice.

677
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:50,845
That's how you get ahold
of Pere Noel on Christmas Eve.

678
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:53,598
- Thank you.
- And remember your time down here.

679
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,934
All right, now, kids,
how does the story end?

680
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:58,144
"Merry Christmas to all,

681
00:32:58,186 --> 00:33:00,855
'til I saw you some mo'!"

682
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:03,108
All right.

683
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:05,735
Hey, hot chocolate
right over here.

684
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:07,862
Oooh!

685
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,364
Hi there.

686
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:14,994
Come in.

687
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:19,833
Oh, hey.
Glad you could make it.

688
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:22,293
Wow... festive.

689
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:25,005
Yeah, I get pretty focused
on my work.

690
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:27,549
Yeah, I mean, I get it.
Practical.

691
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,092
Ah, what the Japanese
call <i>shibui.</i>

692
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,343
Boring?

693
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:32,887
Understated.

694
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:36,224
Oh, hey. So, the town paper
is doing a series on Everett.

695
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:38,393
Asked me to pull
all the public files on him,

696
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:41,521
old articles, government files,
photographs.

697
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:44,024
So I thought maybe you could
use it for your article as well?

698
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,401
That's incredible.
Yeah, thank you.

699
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:49,320
Ugh! So... I haven't
looked at it yet, but...

700
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:50,947
that should keep you busy
for a while.

701
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:53,658
- Yep.
- Feel free to work here as long as you want.

702
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:59,664
- You want coffee?
- The answer to that question will always be yes.

703
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:00,749
Okay.

704
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,260
Hey, you want cream or sugar?

705
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:15,055
Uh, just coffee is fine,
thank you.

706
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,684
This is from the year he left.

707
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:33,406
All right, here we go.

708
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:36,117
So, where should we get started?

709
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,869
Uh, actually, I have to go.

710
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:40,789
Sorry, my, uh, my editor
needs a progress report,

711
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,249
so I have to go
and upload some pictures.

712
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:46,336
But thank you, and, um...
I'll call you?

713
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:48,713
Yep.

714
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:51,508
Fine.

715
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:17,951
She told me about you.
Maybe we'll sit down and visit.

716
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:20,203
She let me know kind of
what's going on...

717
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,957
I figured, look,
this is something

718
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:26,334
that I know what I'm talking
about 'cause I've been there.

719
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,096
- You've been there?
- Yeah, and back again.

720
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:39,180
- Hey.
- Hi.

721
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:41,224
How'd it go with your boss?

722
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:42,851
Uh, yeah, good, good.
Yeah, uh...

723
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:44,728
Just, uh...
just, uh, working away.

724
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:46,229
Great. Do you care
if I sit down?

725
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,398
Sure. Go ahead.

726
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,524
Thank you.

727
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:51,693
- Hey, um...
- Yeah.

728
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:54,029
Who is that guy that Everett
is talking to outside?

729
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,990
- Do you know him?
- Oh, yeah, it's the guy he's been counseling.

730
00:35:57,032 --> 00:35:58,832
- Counseling?
- Yeah, I'm surprised you didn't

731
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:00,535
figure that out
in all your research.

732
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:03,872
- Hmm.
- You have a little...

733
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:07,167
Okay, you have a lot of powdered
sugar on your face right there.

734
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,836
Yeah. Yeah, Everett's been
working with the community center.

735
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:12,797
You know, helping these guys
through hard times

736
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:16,092
like he went through, says
it's his way of giving back.

737
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:19,179
- "Like he'd went through"?
- I don't have the full story.

738
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,515
But, you know, his family's
from here and he was born here.

739
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:24,684
But then he went away
for a few years and so...

740
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:26,728
Hey!

741
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,731
Oh, careful now. That powdered
sugar will take you out.

742
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:31,858
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, I hope you didn't fill up too much,

743
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,361
'cause I saved you
the last meat pies of the day.

744
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:36,654
- You have one yet?
- Um...

745
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:38,823
Pirogues, yes, sambooseh, sure.

746
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:40,533
But a genuine
Louisiana meat pie,

747
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:42,118
I can't say
that I've had the pleasure.

748
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,662
Good. Jackson, you all right
if I steal her away?

749
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:46,414
- Yeah, no, not at all.
- All right.

750
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:48,249
Meat pie's gonna be
a good walking snack.

751
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,668
Walking snack?
Where are we going?

752
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,087
Down to the bayou.
Girls are already there.

753
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,172
I'm gonna give you
a peek behind the curtain.

754
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:00,178
What's the verdict?

755
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,930
Wow. These really are amazing.

756
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:04,224
Ha ha! Made from scratch
every day.

757
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:06,810
- How?
- Get out of bed, make a cup of coffee.

758
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:08,603
Start on the dough.

759
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:11,523
I mean, how?
What goes into them?

760
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:13,900
Oh, a lot of love.

761
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:16,236
I'm gonna show you something
that's great for the article.

762
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:17,779
The article, right.

763
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:23,910
This little skiff
is soon gonna be a sleigh.

764
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:27,539
The Pere Noel family decorates
this bad boy every year.

765
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,582
You gonna give us a hand?

766
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:31,042
Do you want me to help?

767
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,712
In case you haven't noticed yet,
I'm giving you

768
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:36,089
an all-access pass
like you're part of the family.

769
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:39,592
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

770
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:42,303
- Dad, can you help me with this a little bit?
- Yep.

771
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,558
Hey.

772
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,601
Decorating not your thing?

773
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:50,812
I don't like the water so much.

774
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:53,064
Do you know how many gators
are in there?

775
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:55,358
- Alligators?
- Aw, don't worry.

776
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,068
Those mean old gators never eat

777
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,195
one of Pere Noel's girlsl,
they know better.

778
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:01,781
- But <i>I</i> will!
- Dad, put me down, Dad!

779
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:03,408
I'll put you down in the water!

780
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,368
She's gator bait!
She's gator bait!

781
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,370
Oh, she escaped.

782
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:09,706
- Saved your life.
- Whoa!

783
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:12,625
- I gotcha.
- Thank you.

784
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:14,711
I know you're looking
for an immersive experience,

785
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:18,340
but trust me,
going in the bayou ain't it.

786
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:20,425
Yes. Noted.

787
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,973
Well, don't I just miss
all the fun.

788
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:29,893
Mom, Campbell almost fell in
the water, but Dad saved her.

789
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:33,063
- I sure did.
- So that's why you're late.

790
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:36,358
Well, remember, we have that dinner
we have to cater across town.

791
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,943
- Yeah.
- You girls too, so you're going to have to go change.

792
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:43,365
Mom, do we have to? I have so many stories to
write down before I forget all the details.

793
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:46,635
Look, it's gonna be a late night, and I
really don't want you girls here by yourself.

794
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,787
I can watch them.

795
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:51,039
But, Mom, we do not need
a babysitter.

796
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:54,084
Oh, I don't babysit.
Don't worry.

797
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:57,337
No, but we could have,
like, a Christmas sleepover?

798
00:38:57,379 --> 00:39:00,882
And I can give you those
pictures I took today, so...

799
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:04,344
Yeah... Mom, Dad, please!

800
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:06,179
Yes, okay, fine. Yes.

801
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:08,264
All right, but they gotta be
in bed by 10:00.

802
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:10,809
Not a minute later!

803
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,227
- You got it.
- All right.

804
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:13,728
And you need to go change.

805
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,272
I do, yeah.
Wow, you look great.

806
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:18,233
- Is that what you're going to wear?
- Yes.

807
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:24,114
I mean, ice-cream snowman.
It's brilliant.

808
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:27,450
It's the closest we can get
to real snow around here, so...

809
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:30,662
Oh! Think he's melting.

810
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,414
Oh, here, let me help.

811
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:36,042
Oh, yeah.

812
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,294
Um...

813
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:41,089
I think this is jammed.

814
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:45,885
Here, let me see it.

815
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:49,848
- Oh, my God.
- Look!

816
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,850
Oh, my God!

817
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:53,935
- I still don't appreciate it.
- Hair!

818
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:57,522
No!

819
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:02,444
Get off!

820
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:04,904
<i>Okay, smile.</i>

821
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:07,574
Nice!

822
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:08,742
Oh, those are good.

823
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:12,871
So, since I'm
the writer in the family,

824
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:14,122
I do the Christmas cards

825
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:15,957
and Mary-Margaret
makes the gifts.

826
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,292
Wait, you made these?

827
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:20,086
Yeah, it's not a big deal.

828
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:22,630
That's why
you're so good with the camera.

829
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:24,966
Like I said,
you've got a great eye.

830
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:27,761
Oh... it's whatever.

831
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:30,638
You know it's okay
to like things, right?

832
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,767
Like photography, for example.

833
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:35,727
Yeah, but it's not cool.

834
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,604
I think it's cool!

835
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:40,774
And I have made a career
doing it, so...

836
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:42,984
maybe give me that one?

837
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,319
Fine.

838
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:47,489
I do like it.

839
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,742
But most people
will see it as...

840
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:53,870
like a teenage girl,
always on her phone, so...

841
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:56,706
Well, maybe you just need
a real camera.

842
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:58,500
You're just saying
this stuff to be nice.

843
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,126
You do this stuff for real.

844
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:03,630
Yeah, but, you know,
even when you do it for real,

845
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:05,298
you wonder if you're any good.

846
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,052
Like, for instance,
I wasn't sure

847
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:11,763
I wanted to take this assignment
and come here to Sorrento.

848
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:14,599
- I was nervous.
- Really?

849
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:18,228
Sure. I mean,
being scared and anxious

850
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:21,272
doesn't just go away
because you get older.

851
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:24,818
You just learn to not let
those feelings stop you

852
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:26,611
and go after it anyway.

853
00:41:30,615 --> 00:41:34,119
And sometimes the stuff that
really scares you the most

854
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,205
ends up being the best thing
that's ever happened.

855
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,712
- Deep.
- Thanks.

856
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:45,338
Yeah, it was pretty deep.

857
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,341
Like, hit this road
and it was like...

858
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:51,845
I'm doin' my thing.

859
00:41:51,886 --> 00:41:53,430
<i>It was so much fun.</i>

860
00:41:53,471 --> 00:41:54,681
<i>Do they know yet?</i>

861
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,099
No, still Jennifer.

862
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:57,559
The moment hasn't felt right

863
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,186
and I still have
so many questions.

864
00:42:00,228 --> 00:42:03,398
I feel kind of guilty, and I
know I have to tell him, but...

865
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,026
<i>Remember, you're in control
of how this goes.</i>

866
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:07,861
I know, Dad,
but it's nice to hear.

867
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:09,696
Campbell, popcorn's ready!

868
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:12,032
Oh, I gotta go,
a movie's starting.

869
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:13,908
I told them about
our movie night tradition,

870
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,202
and they wanted
to do it too, so, um...

871
00:42:16,244 --> 00:42:19,039
I miss you both so much.
I'll call you later.

872
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,416
<i>- Love you.
- Miss you, kiddo.</i>

873
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:24,127
I love you, bye. Bye.

874
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:27,047
<i>A merry Christmas to you! I
hope you succeeded yesterday.</i>

875
00:42:27,088 --> 00:42:29,466
<i>I'm afraid it's not
a very pleasant one for you.</i>

876
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:31,885
<i>But will you allow me
to ask your pardon?</i>

877
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:36,222
<i>And would you be good enough
to put me down?</i>

878
00:42:36,264 --> 00:42:38,725
<i>Lord bless my soul.
My dear Mr. Scrooge...</i>

879
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,769
We're home. Anyone still...?

880
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:43,605
<i>- Not a farthing less, sir.
- My dear sir!</i>

881
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:47,150
<i>- I'm afraid there are many backpayments included in it.
- My dear Mr. Scrooge!</i>

882
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:49,569
<i>You come round and see me.
You will come round?</i>

883
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:51,071
<i>Oh, we will, we will!</i>

884
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:56,201
You're thinking about her,
aren't you?

885
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,703
More than ever.

886
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:03,625
You think we should
wake them up?

887
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,210
No, no, no, let them sleep.

888
00:43:25,105 --> 00:43:28,108
Hi. Merry Christmas Eve.

889
00:43:28,149 --> 00:43:30,485
Brought the coffee this time.

890
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:32,654
And this.

891
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:34,989
Thought it might bring you
a little Christmas cheer.

892
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:36,491
Thank you very much.

893
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,036
Are you okay?

894
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:44,082
What are you doing here?

895
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,085
I brought you
the Christmas tree.

896
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:49,295
And the coffee.

897
00:43:49,337 --> 00:43:53,341
I mean, what are you doing
here in Sorrento?

898
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:56,177
I'm writing a story.
You know that.

899
00:43:56,219 --> 00:43:58,221
That's not
all you're doing, Campbell.

900
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:00,765
What do you mean?

901
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,312
You're not here to write
a story, <i>you</i> are the story.

902
00:44:06,354 --> 00:44:08,356
You're her.

903
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:11,067
You're Everett Bergeron's
other daughter.

904
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:20,744
It's true, isn't it?

905
00:44:20,785 --> 00:44:22,579
You're Everett's daughter.

906
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:26,958
C-Campbell.

907
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,293
Campbell!

908
00:44:37,844 --> 00:44:39,637
Hey, Campbell,
will you slow down?

909
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:41,282
- You're such a fast walker.
- Do you need something?

910
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:43,576
- Yeah, I want to talk to you.
- There's nothing to talk about.

911
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,935
- It's between me and my dad.
- Ah, see, I knew it!

912
00:44:45,977 --> 00:44:47,937
Yeah, okay, fine,
I'm Everett's daughter.

913
00:44:47,979 --> 00:44:49,773
- He doesn't know, does he?
- No, he doesn't.

914
00:44:49,814 --> 00:44:51,709
I mean, he knows that
he has a daughter somewhere,

915
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:54,110
but he doesn't know that I'm...

916
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:56,905
- How do you know?
- I'm the town's sacred record keeper.

917
00:44:56,946 --> 00:45:00,116
I know all, and you took
the file from my office.

918
00:45:00,158 --> 00:45:03,036
I looked at the backup...
three daughters.

919
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:05,789
- And then I did some digging on the internet.
- Some?

920
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,475
Okay, I did a lot of digging
on the internet,

921
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:09,334
and I put the pieces together.

922
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:11,878
- You're such a nerd.
- It takes one to know one, doesn't it?

923
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,756
Well, now you know.
Here's your file.

924
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:18,927
You better not be following me.

925
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:20,845
Hey, I just wanna know
why you're doing this.

926
00:45:20,887 --> 00:45:22,847
Because I want to know him.

927
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:27,102
- I want to know the real him.
- And what have you learned?

928
00:45:27,143 --> 00:45:28,269
Not much.

929
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:32,315
We've been doing
all the Pere Noel stuff together

930
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:35,360
and hanging out with the family
and we've had talks, sure,

931
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:38,613
but we haven't, you know,
sat down and, one-on-one...

932
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:41,074
Okay, so,
what's holding you back?

933
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:44,285
Okay, fine, yeah,
maybe I'm a little scared.

934
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:48,665
I was scared because I didn't
want him to know who I was,

935
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:52,002
and then I was scared because,
you know, if he knew,

936
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:53,938
he might not tell me the truth
about why he left.

937
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:57,465
And now I'm scared because...

938
00:45:57,507 --> 00:45:59,634
you know, I like him.

939
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:02,637
And maybe I don't <i>want</i>
to know the truth.

940
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:05,348
He seems like... a good guy.

941
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:08,810
And... I'm so glad
that my sisters

942
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:12,147
have a loving
and present father,

943
00:46:12,188 --> 00:46:14,607
but I just...

944
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:17,027
I... I have so many questions
about the past

945
00:46:17,068 --> 00:46:19,696
and they're really hard to ask.

946
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:21,948
I think I know someone
that can help.

947
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,660
So, where do we start?

948
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:26,995
Bit of town history?

949
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:29,539
We were named
after Sorrento, Italy,

950
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:34,586
because a German railroad tycoon brought
his wife there on their anniversary.

951
00:46:34,627 --> 00:46:36,713
Honeymoon, actually.

952
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:38,840
- Nerd.
- You know I can hear you?

953
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:42,802
Actually, um, I wanted to
ask you about Everett Bergeron?

954
00:46:42,844 --> 00:46:44,429
Just background stuff, you know.

955
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:45,847
I know he grew up here.

956
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:48,391
I heard you were
friends as kids.

957
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:50,935
Sure were. Thick as thieves.

958
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:53,688
Yeah, he went away after school,

959
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,690
and he only came back
when his dad got sick

960
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:58,526
and later passed away.

961
00:46:58,568 --> 00:47:00,403
That messed up Everett
really bad.

962
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:03,156
- How so?
- Well, he was broke.

963
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:05,617
And when I say broke,
I don't mean money, I...

964
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:08,036
Well, I do mean money,
but I also mean

965
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:09,996
that something inside of him
was broke.

966
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:11,539
And I know that because
at the time,

967
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:13,875
something inside me
was broke too.

968
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:15,585
I'd just gotten back
from a deployment,

969
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:17,337
and I hit rock bottom.

970
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:20,715
So in a way you two were meant
to find each other again.

971
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,425
That's exactly right.

972
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:24,219
We were both washing dishes

973
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,429
over at old lady Robert's
restaurant,

974
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:29,557
and even though it was the worst
time in Everett's life,

975
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,060
he always
had time for me, always.

976
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:35,230
He's the reason
I am in the place I am today.

977
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:38,441
Did he ever say anything
about that time he was away,

978
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:40,110
any idea what happened?

979
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:42,237
Only that he had to get
his life together.

980
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:45,907
He always said he didn't want
to be the man his father was.

981
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:48,743
Uh... maybe that last part
should be off the record.

982
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:50,578
It's all off the record,
don't worry.

983
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,955
Okay.

984
00:47:51,996 --> 00:47:53,832
Well, fast-forward a bit.

985
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:55,583
He worked his way up on the job

986
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:59,254
and inherited old lady Robert's
recipes when she passed away.

987
00:47:59,295 --> 00:48:01,756
He started a business,
married Jennifer,

988
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,633
had two beautiful girls.

989
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:06,511
Between you and me, he's been
acting a little different

990
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:08,680
since he was named Pere Noel.

991
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:12,267
He actually tried
to turn the honor down.

992
00:48:12,308 --> 00:48:14,936
And I've been thinking,
maybe the stuff...

993
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:16,896
the stuff with his dad
and his family

994
00:48:16,938 --> 00:48:18,565
had something to do with it.

995
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:28,033
So, should I talk first,
or will you?

996
00:48:28,074 --> 00:48:30,952
The suspense is killing me.

997
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:34,205
It's just, I didn't know
about his father getting sick

998
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:36,624
and about him wanting
to come back

999
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:40,086
or turning down Pere Noel.

1000
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:42,797
Do you ever feel like
getting more information

1001
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:44,758
just makes you more confused?

1002
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,218
Yeah. But I think
you and I both know

1003
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,972
there's only one way
you're gonna find out.

1004
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:52,891
By spending time with your dad.

1005
00:48:52,932 --> 00:48:54,726
All right, merry Christmas.
Thank you.

1006
00:48:54,768 --> 00:48:57,187
Hey, Joe, what are you
going for today?

1007
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:00,899
Yeah. Yeah.

1008
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,650
You're right.

1009
00:49:02,692 --> 00:49:04,194
Five, ten.

1010
00:49:04,235 --> 00:49:06,321
Thank you, Cindy,
merry Christmas to you.

1011
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:08,490
Hey, Everett,
how you doing up there?

1012
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:11,177
Boy, I tell ya, I'm sorry Jennifer
took the girls Christmas shopping.

1013
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:13,870
- I'm flying solo up here!
- Funny you say that.

1014
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:16,998
Campbell was just telling me that she
wants to learn how the food truck works.

1015
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,708
- Really?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

1016
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,002
- I sure was.
- Well, get up here, Campbell.

1017
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:22,837
I could use
all the help I can get.

1018
00:49:22,879 --> 00:49:24,923
- The best research is hands on.
- That's true.

1019
00:49:24,964 --> 00:49:26,174
What are you looking for?

1020
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:28,468
- Okay, got it.
- See ya, Everett.

1021
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,136
All right, you be good.

1022
00:49:30,178 --> 00:49:32,639
Meat? Meat, just regular meat.
Okay, that's $4.00.

1023
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:34,224
- Okay.
- Hey, all right, get comfy.

1024
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:36,059
- It's hot in the kitchen here.
- Yep.

1025
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:38,687
You run the window.
Uh, I'll fill the orders.

1026
00:49:38,728 --> 00:49:41,690
There's your cash box.
Four bucks a pie.

1027
00:49:41,731 --> 00:49:43,400
Hi.

1028
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:49,715
- What else you got?
- Two meats, two sweets.

1029
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:51,175
- Two meats, two sweets.
- Thank you, sir.

1030
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:53,034
That's for you.
Have a merry Christmas.

1031
00:49:53,993 --> 00:49:56,162
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

1032
00:49:56,204 --> 00:49:58,164
How's, uh... had fun
shopping with the kids?

1033
00:49:58,206 --> 00:49:59,833
Yeah, I just thought
I'd break away

1034
00:49:59,874 --> 00:50:01,543
and see how Everett was doing.

1035
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:04,004
<i>Tout de suite!</i>

1036
00:50:04,045 --> 00:50:05,856
- See what I did there?
- Yeah, that was pretty cool.

1037
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,632
Hey, Karen, how are you doing?

1038
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:09,217
Those two seem to be
getting along.

1039
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:11,720
Yeah, which is a good thing.

1040
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:13,930
Why is that?

1041
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:16,766
Well... 'cause Campbell's
here all alone, you know,

1042
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:20,270
and Christmas,
and Everett's like a father.

1043
00:50:21,688 --> 00:50:24,232
Figure. A father figure.

1044
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:25,942
Which is good,

1045
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:28,069
you know,
'cause it's Christmas time.

1046
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:29,446
Wait, what do you know?

1047
00:50:29,487 --> 00:50:32,115
I don't know,
is there something to know?

1048
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:34,117
I think you know there is.

1049
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:36,786
I may know something.

1050
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:38,580
Thank goodness.

1051
00:50:38,621 --> 00:50:42,167
I thought I was going
to explode keeping that secret.

1052
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:43,918
So you're responsible for this?

1053
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,337
Sorry, I didn't mean
to skip you.

1054
00:50:45,378 --> 00:50:46,921
She didn't count right.

1055
00:50:46,963 --> 00:50:49,090
Well, I just didn't want
Campbell to miss out

1056
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:51,092
on something that could be
potentially great.

1057
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:54,679
Nah, I'm kidding.

1058
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:57,140
Come on, now, merry Christmas.

1059
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:58,725
I'm gonna need your help.

1060
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:01,227
But we have to keep it
a secret until Campbell's ready.

1061
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:04,105
Deal.

1062
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:10,487
Better count her money
real quick, 'cause I don't know.

1063
00:51:10,528 --> 00:51:11,696
You're doing good, though.

1064
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:23,124
Oooh!

1065
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:25,251
- Thank you.
- There you go. Cheers.

1066
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:27,003
Good day, thanks for the help.

1067
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:28,380
Of course.

1068
00:51:32,842 --> 00:51:34,511
So, you do this every time?

1069
00:51:34,552 --> 00:51:36,930
Oh, food truck goes out
about twice a week,

1070
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:39,808
but at Christmas time, the demand
is like you wouldn't believe.

1071
00:51:39,849 --> 00:51:42,977
Oh, I believe it.

1072
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:46,022
Um... I heard something
about a secret ingredient?

1073
00:51:46,064 --> 00:51:48,108
Any chance I might
pry it out of you?

1074
00:51:48,149 --> 00:51:50,402
Well, I could tell ya,

1075
00:51:50,443 --> 00:51:52,612
but then I'd have to
feed you to the gators.

1076
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:57,325
Sorry, that's
a Bergeron family secret.

1077
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,619
Yeah. Do you mind if I
ask you a few questions?

1078
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:01,996
We haven't had the chance
to do that yet.

1079
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:04,374
- Now's a good time.
- Okay.

1080
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,544
Um...

1081
00:52:07,585 --> 00:52:09,879
Well, how did you meet
your wife, Jennifer?

1082
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:11,548
Oh, uh...

1083
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:14,175
at the supermarket,
if you can believe it.

1084
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:15,844
She was a cashier,
and I was making a run

1085
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:17,196
for a restaurant
I was working for.

1086
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,555
Oh, old lady Robert's?

1087
00:52:20,473 --> 00:52:23,018
I forget sometimes
I'm talking to a reporter.

1088
00:52:23,059 --> 00:52:26,730
Well, anyway, they said, "Bring
back as many onions as you can,"

1089
00:52:26,771 --> 00:52:30,275
so there I am pushing a cart full of
nothing but onions up to her register,

1090
00:52:30,316 --> 00:52:34,195
and, I mean, it was weird for
sure, and we laughed about it.

1091
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:37,866
And then she threw in
a chocolate candy bar.

1092
00:52:37,907 --> 00:52:38,992
For free.

1093
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:40,744
And she said...

1094
00:52:40,785 --> 00:52:45,040
"We all need to treat ourselves
every now and again."

1095
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:49,044
Next day, I go back to
the store, buy her a candy bar,

1096
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:50,628
ask her out on a date.

1097
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:54,674
And the rest,
as they say, is history.

1098
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:57,552
Oh, speaking of history,

1099
00:52:57,594 --> 00:53:00,305
I heard there were
a handful of years,

1100
00:53:00,347 --> 00:53:03,600
uh, that you lived in Texas.

1101
00:53:03,641 --> 00:53:05,268
That's where I live.

1102
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,687
I... I was born in Houston,

1103
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:10,106
but, um, we moved to Dallas
when I was a kid.

1104
00:53:10,148 --> 00:53:11,775
- Really?
- Yeah.

1105
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:18,114
Everett, I, um...

1106
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,789
I-I was wondering
if you would teach me

1107
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:27,332
how to make a meat pie sometime.

1108
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:30,960
Me and the girls
are way ahead of you.

1109
00:53:31,002 --> 00:53:32,754
- Great.
- You'll see.

1110
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:34,631
Good.

1111
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:37,175
Um, "We all need to..."

1112
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:38,778
- Treat ourselves.
- "...treat ourselves..."

1113
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:40,804
- Every now and again.
- "...every now and again."

1114
00:53:40,845 --> 00:53:42,305
- Words to live by.
- You do still?

1115
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:44,849
- Oh, yeah.
- ♪ <i>And I wonder if you ♪</i>

1116
00:53:44,891 --> 00:53:47,602
Very sweet. <i>-♪ Could
make My dreams come true ♪</i>

1117
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:49,270
<i>♪ And spend it</i>

1118
00:53:49,312 --> 00:53:52,857
<i>♪ Here with me</i>

1119
00:53:57,612 --> 00:53:59,989
All right, Campbell. What
do you know about meat pies?

1120
00:54:00,031 --> 00:54:03,201
I understand there's
a meat component

1121
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:05,078
and a pie component.

1122
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,996
- And they're delicious.
- The best.

1123
00:54:07,038 --> 00:54:08,790
- Yes.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1124
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:10,875
- Baking boot camp?
- Baking boot camp.

1125
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:12,335
- I'll get the aprons.
- Oh.

1126
00:54:12,377 --> 00:54:14,337
- It's a real thing.
- It's a thing, okay, yeah.

1127
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:16,965
- For you.
- Thank you.

1128
00:54:20,176 --> 00:54:24,472
Thank you. Lookie there.

1129
00:54:24,514 --> 00:54:26,266
- All right.
- Beautiful.

1130
00:54:26,307 --> 00:54:29,978
Not too tight.

1131
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,689
Hu-hu-humm!

1132
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:36,401
All right.
First things first.

1133
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:39,779
- Let's talk dough.
- Ooooh!

1134
00:54:41,656 --> 00:54:43,199
Ohh!

1135
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:44,909
Prep your surface.
Good, good, good.

1136
00:54:44,951 --> 00:54:46,786
- Nice and even.
- Now the dough.

1137
00:54:46,828 --> 00:54:49,289
Grab a baseball.
Perfect, just like that.

1138
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,374
Okay, now, let's get
that thing flat.

1139
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:53,043
- That's a shaper.
- Oh.

1140
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:55,337
<i>Wisht!</i>

1141
00:54:55,378 --> 00:54:57,464
- <i>Voilà!</i>
- Hey!

1142
00:54:57,505 --> 00:54:59,466
Time to fill 'em up!

1143
00:54:59,507 --> 00:55:01,468
Ooh, is this
secret ingredient time?

1144
00:55:01,509 --> 00:55:03,803
Family only, remember the rules.

1145
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:04,929
Okay!

1146
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:08,600
Moment of truth...

1147
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:11,144
Mmm!

1148
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:12,937
- Ten!
- Okay!

1149
00:55:12,979 --> 00:55:17,359
You couldn't have made this
better if you were one of us.

1150
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,737
Oh, let's take a photo. We can generate
some buzz for Christmas Eve tomorrow.

1151
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:23,406
- Like that? Gr-Grab on.
- Smile!

1152
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:25,158
- How's that?
- Perfect.

1153
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,201
- Good?
- And smile!

1154
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:27,869
Ha ha!

1155
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:29,746
Good. Perfect.

1156
00:55:29,788 --> 00:55:31,873
All right.

1157
00:55:31,915 --> 00:55:36,294
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, let's go compose the ultimate post for mom.

1158
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:38,088
- I'm taking this with me!
- Okay.

1159
00:55:38,129 --> 00:55:39,756
Yeah, don't you worry
about a thing.

1160
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:42,717
- We'll clean up, yeah.
- Thanks, Dad!

1161
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:45,887
Hey, thanks for sticking around.

1162
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:47,138
Appreciate it.

1163
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:49,891
Uh, I know it's late,

1164
00:55:49,933 --> 00:55:52,519
but, um, I have a few more
questions for you

1165
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,187
if you don't mind?

1166
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:56,439
- Sure.
- Why don't we talk about,

1167
00:55:56,481 --> 00:55:59,150
um... you being Pere Noel?

1168
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:03,321
- Yeah, sure.
- He's sort of the ultimate father figure, right?

1169
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:06,241
Yeah. You could say that.

1170
00:56:06,282 --> 00:56:10,662
How does it feel to be
honored in that way?

1171
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:13,540
Well, uh, I mean, I've had a...

1172
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:15,375
a difficult family life.

1173
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:16,751
You know, my own father,

1174
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:19,379
he... he wasn't the greatest,

1175
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:21,256
and I made some mistakes

1176
00:56:21,297 --> 00:56:22,674
concerning my family,

1177
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:24,384
but, you know, now I would do

1178
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:26,261
anything to make things right.

1179
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:28,805
Anything. Huh.

1180
00:56:28,847 --> 00:56:32,267
Now, listen, we are talking
about Pere Noel the character,

1181
00:56:32,308 --> 00:56:33,852
the festival, all that, right?

1182
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:36,312
Yeah, it's
a human interest piece,

1183
00:56:36,354 --> 00:56:40,275
and, um, you're
a very interesting human.

1184
00:56:40,316 --> 00:56:42,193
Okay.

1185
00:56:44,195 --> 00:56:47,741
It's just that I have
done a little digging.

1186
00:56:47,782 --> 00:56:51,161
Really?
What did you find out?

1187
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:56,416
Well, this is a sight.

1188
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:58,585
Where are the other two
little elves that live here?

1189
00:56:58,626 --> 00:57:02,881
I hope they didn't leave you
both all this mess.

1190
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:06,134
They're upstairs composing
the ultimate post.

1191
00:57:06,176 --> 00:57:07,552
Well, don't mind me.

1192
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:09,387
I just brought some things
for the truck.

1193
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:10,930
No, we were just wrapping up.

1194
00:57:10,972 --> 00:57:13,266
I'm sure Campbell's
gotta get back to the cottage

1195
00:57:13,308 --> 00:57:15,268
and work on that article.

1196
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,187
Yeah, yes, yep.

1197
00:57:19,272 --> 00:57:21,316
Lots to catch up on.

1198
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:23,109
Thank you for a great evening.

1199
00:57:23,151 --> 00:57:25,195
Mm-hmm.

1200
00:57:25,236 --> 00:57:26,363
I'll see you tomorrow.

1201
00:57:26,404 --> 00:57:28,073
- Bye.
- Bye.

1202
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:34,913
<i>Hey, Mom, do you have a minute?</i>

1203
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:37,040
<i>Sure. What's going on?</i>

1204
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:40,960
Well, uh... I learned how
to make meat pies tonight.

1205
00:57:41,002 --> 00:57:42,629
That's a first.

1206
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:44,506
And I'm heading back
to the cottage

1207
00:57:44,547 --> 00:57:46,800
to write my article.

1208
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:48,009
Hey, um...

1209
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:51,346
why did Everett leave?

1210
00:57:51,388 --> 00:57:53,807
Campbell, you know this.

1211
00:57:53,848 --> 00:57:54,933
Yeah, sure.

1212
00:57:54,974 --> 00:57:56,142
Uh, just...

1213
00:57:56,184 --> 00:57:58,061
just walk me through it.

1214
00:57:58,103 --> 00:57:59,646
<i>We were young</i>

1215
00:57:59,688 --> 00:58:02,524
and Everett wasn't ready
to be a father.

1216
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:05,151
I mean, I wasn't ready
to be a mother either,

1217
00:58:05,193 --> 00:58:06,778
but it just hit him hard,

1218
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,072
<i>and when you were two,
he lost his job,</i>

1219
00:58:09,114 --> 00:58:11,116
<i>and he was a wreck.</i>

1220
00:58:11,157 --> 00:58:13,952
Anyway, after he left,

1221
00:58:13,993 --> 00:58:16,371
<i>it was just like
he didn't want to be found.</i>

1222
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:18,540
<i>So I stopped trying.</i>

1223
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:22,794
You don't think maybe
he wanted to come back?

1224
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:25,630
Well, if he wanted to come back,
he would have.

1225
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:27,632
<i>Why? Did he say something?</i>

1226
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:31,720
No. No, not officially.

1227
00:58:31,761 --> 00:58:34,639
I'm still trying
to get the truth out of him.

1228
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:38,143
- You want my two cents?
- Sure.

1229
00:58:38,184 --> 00:58:40,812
<i>He's never going to spill
his guts to a journalist,</i>

1230
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:45,025
<i>but he might tell his daughter
everything she wants to know.</i>

1231
00:58:45,066 --> 00:58:47,527
Oh, I forgot my camera
back at the house.

1232
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:49,654
Can I call you back?

1233
00:58:49,696 --> 00:58:53,366
- Sure. Love you.
- I love you too.

1234
00:58:53,408 --> 00:58:57,203
Everett, wait, wait!

1235
00:58:57,245 --> 00:58:59,456
Everett, just talk to me!

1236
00:58:59,497 --> 00:59:02,000
Talk to me.

1237
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:05,170
Jennifer, I know that your heart
is in the right place,

1238
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:09,591
but having Campbell here digging
into my past, it's too much.

1239
00:59:09,632 --> 00:59:11,551
Okay, yes.
I'm sorry, I really am.

1240
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:14,888
But maybe it's a good thing?
It could be cathartic.

1241
00:59:14,929 --> 00:59:17,390
Look, I'm only trying
to do what's best for you.

1242
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:18,725
I know.

1243
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:21,853
I know, and...
I love you for it.

1244
00:59:25,523 --> 00:59:28,401
I ever tell you about
the last time I saw her?

1245
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:30,487
No.

1246
00:59:30,528 --> 00:59:32,405
After I was away
for a few years,

1247
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:34,074
I started to think,

1248
00:59:34,115 --> 00:59:37,077
I'm on my way to being
a better man, better father,

1249
00:59:37,118 --> 00:59:39,746
so I thought,
well, I should look her up.

1250
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:43,458
So I researched Alice's school,
and it turns out

1251
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,461
they're having
a Christmas pageant.

1252
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:50,840
I thought, well,
that's the perfect time.

1253
00:59:50,882 --> 00:59:52,926
So I drove back to Texas
all night

1254
00:59:52,967 --> 00:59:55,220
and I stood in the back
of the auditorium and...

1255
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:58,098
I watched the whole thing.

1256
00:59:58,139 --> 01:00:00,058
And...

1257
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:04,854
she was just the cutest thing
you've ever seen.

1258
01:00:04,896 --> 01:00:06,776
So after the show,
I thought I'd go talk to her,

1259
01:00:06,815 --> 01:00:09,359
but her... her mom
and this other man

1260
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:12,153
get their first,

1261
01:00:12,195 --> 01:00:14,864
and he gives her roses

1262
01:00:14,906 --> 01:00:16,783
and she jumps into his arms.

1263
01:00:18,284 --> 01:00:20,161
They were so happy, Jennifer.

1264
01:00:22,288 --> 01:00:24,791
It was...

1265
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:28,712
it was the perfect family.

1266
01:00:28,753 --> 01:00:30,964
Then what happened?

1267
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:32,924
I left.

1268
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:36,428
But I never stopped loving her.

1269
01:00:38,596 --> 01:00:41,891
Even if I have to love her
from a distance...

1270
01:00:44,936 --> 01:00:47,397
she'll always be right here.

1271
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:51,317
<i>♪ Christmas lights</i>

1272
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,695
<i>♪ See them shine</i>

1273
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:56,114
<i>♪ In the eyes</i>

1274
01:00:56,156 --> 01:00:58,324
<i>♪ Of a child</i>

1275
01:01:00,368 --> 01:01:03,038
<i>♪ Let them shine</i>

1276
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:42,494
Hi, merry Christmas Eve.
What can I get you?

1277
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,715
How are my two
favorite tastemakers?

1278
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:57,300
Hungry.

1279
01:01:57,342 --> 01:01:59,386
You're awfully quiet.
What's up?

1280
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:01,179
Just...

1281
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:04,474
when tonight is over,
you've got to go home, right?

1282
01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:07,143
Well, she has work, Amelia. She
can't just stay here forever.

1283
01:02:07,185 --> 01:02:08,895
Well, I know that, but...

1284
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:11,731
Well, that doesn't mean
I'm leaving, not really.

1285
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:14,234
I mean, we still
have Christmas breakfast,

1286
01:02:14,275 --> 01:02:16,986
and then we can
video-chat and text,

1287
01:02:17,028 --> 01:02:19,197
and I'm only
an hour away by plane.

1288
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:21,866
So... I can come back
and visit.

1289
01:02:21,908 --> 01:02:23,201
- You promise?
- Yeah.

1290
01:02:23,243 --> 01:02:25,328
- You'll come back?
- I promise.

1291
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,038
In the meantime,

1292
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,749
I have a very important
mission for you guys.

1293
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,877
I need to go help your mom with
my new skills in the truck,

1294
01:02:32,919 --> 01:02:35,422
and I need someone to go around
and take some pictures

1295
01:02:35,463 --> 01:02:36,965
for my article.

1296
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,800
Are you guys up for it?

1297
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:40,468
- Wait, for real?
- Yeah.

1298
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:43,179
- You can count on us.
- Okay, good. Here. Be careful.

1299
01:02:43,221 --> 01:02:45,223
- Yes!
- -Come on, Mary-Margaret.

1300
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:50,395
Here. And needless to say,
he never went caroling again.

1301
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:56,443
Everything all right, there?

1302
01:02:56,484 --> 01:02:59,654
Um, yeah. I'm just, um...

1303
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:00,780
just thinking.

1304
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:02,866
Anything I can help with?

1305
01:03:02,907 --> 01:03:05,535
Not unless, uh, you know
how to tell the man

1306
01:03:05,577 --> 01:03:09,164
you're writing a story about
that you're his daughter.

1307
01:03:09,205 --> 01:03:11,166
You're gonna tell him?

1308
01:03:11,207 --> 01:03:13,209
Yeah, it's, uh... it's time.

1309
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:19,257
I don't know why
you did it, you know,

1310
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:23,678
uh, finding me, and, uh,
asking me here

1311
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,555
and helping me through the week.

1312
01:03:25,597 --> 01:03:26,765
But, um...

1313
01:03:26,806 --> 01:03:29,059
thank you...

1314
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,811
from the bottom of my heart.

1315
01:03:31,853 --> 01:03:33,938
Well, you know,
you don't need a reason

1316
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,983
to bring more love
into the world.

1317
01:03:37,025 --> 01:03:39,444
Ladies, we're out of meat pies.
Need some more.

1318
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:42,781
Excuse you, we were having
a moment here.

1319
01:03:42,822 --> 01:03:45,033
You know what?

1320
01:03:45,075 --> 01:03:48,244
Why don't you take it easy,
go walk around the party,

1321
01:03:48,286 --> 01:03:49,913
and I can handle things here?

1322
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:51,623
Okay.

1323
01:03:51,664 --> 01:03:54,250
Have fun.

1324
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:55,085
Thank you.

1325
01:03:55,126 --> 01:03:56,586
You're welcome.

1326
01:04:13,895 --> 01:04:16,147
All right, so,
what are you going to tell him?

1327
01:04:16,189 --> 01:04:17,816
You are just as bad as Jennifer.

1328
01:04:17,857 --> 01:04:20,568
- It's a big moment, Campbell.
- I know it's a big moment.

1329
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:23,255
I'm trying not to freak out, and
the two of you are making it worse.

1330
01:04:23,279 --> 01:04:25,174
Ah, so what you're saying is,
you need a distraction.

1331
01:04:25,198 --> 01:04:26,658
- Yes, please.
- Hmm.

1332
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,702
Do you know how to two-step?

1333
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:32,539
- No?
- No.

1334
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,166
- Really good.
- Yeah.

1335
01:04:38,503 --> 01:04:40,338
Oh, wow, you think
you're really smooth, huh?

1336
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,608
I promise you I did not know
it was going to be a slow song.

1337
01:04:42,632 --> 01:04:45,051
- I am so sorry.
- So, you don't want to dance?

1338
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:48,054
- No, I didn't say that.
- I'm messing with you, Jackson.

1339
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:52,058
Take my hand.

1340
01:04:55,687 --> 01:04:58,273
Never had a Christmas quite
like this one, I must say.

1341
01:04:58,314 --> 01:05:00,066
Yeah?
Where was your last one?

1342
01:05:00,108 --> 01:05:04,446
Uh, I was about a hundred miles
outside of Ulaanbaatar,

1343
01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:06,531
learning how
the Mongolian herders

1344
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:09,159
keep their animals alive
during the winter.

1345
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,495
- So a very normal one.
- Yes, yes. Mm-hmm.

1346
01:05:12,537 --> 01:05:15,457
Don't worry,
this one is... much better.

1347
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:22,881
Yeah, way less chance
of frostbite here.

1348
01:05:22,922 --> 01:05:24,341
I'm pretty sure
I read every book

1349
01:05:24,382 --> 01:05:26,926
on the outside world
past the parish lines,

1350
01:05:26,968 --> 01:05:28,928
and I've never been past them.

1351
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:31,097
I can't believe that. How?

1352
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:32,891
My family's been here
for generations.

1353
01:05:32,932 --> 01:05:34,559
My parents had me later in life,

1354
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:36,519
and I'm pretty sure
they don't want me to leave.

1355
01:05:36,561 --> 01:05:39,939
- Hmm.
- Follow in the old family footsteps.

1356
01:05:39,981 --> 01:05:43,401
Become Pere Noel,
work for the city.

1357
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:46,237
Settle down, essentially do
everything that they did.

1358
01:05:46,279 --> 01:05:50,283
I mean, I know
it's none of my business,

1359
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:53,953
but I think your family
would want you to be happy

1360
01:05:53,995 --> 01:05:56,706
and leave Sorrento,
if that's what you want,

1361
01:05:56,748 --> 01:05:58,792
you know, see the world
outside of your books.

1362
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:00,794
Yeah. Maybe.

1363
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:05,840
So, okay, where would you go
if you could be anywhere?

1364
01:06:05,882 --> 01:06:07,801
That's a very good question.

1365
01:06:07,842 --> 01:06:09,427
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1366
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:11,262
Um...

1367
01:06:11,304 --> 01:06:12,847
Where are <i>you</i> going next?

1368
01:06:14,766 --> 01:06:16,559
Um...

1369
01:06:16,601 --> 01:06:18,937
my editor was talking
about me doing a story

1370
01:06:18,978 --> 01:06:21,064
in Morocco.

1371
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:23,650
- Morocco?
- Mm-hmm.

1372
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:25,735
That's where I want to go.

1373
01:06:41,418 --> 01:06:43,211
Campbell, come on!

1374
01:06:43,253 --> 01:06:45,755
Oh, it's starting.

1375
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:47,507
Are you coming?

1376
01:07:06,901 --> 01:07:08,611
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1377
01:07:08,653 --> 01:07:10,488
Merry Christmas!

1378
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:13,241
Now, you know I'm not
one for big speeches.

1379
01:07:13,283 --> 01:07:15,827
It occurred to me that Christmas

1380
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:19,748
happens during the darkest
and coldest time of the year.

1381
01:07:19,789 --> 01:07:22,500
And here in Louisiana,
that's about 50 degrees.

1382
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:26,171
But with our care
for each other,

1383
01:07:26,212 --> 01:07:28,214
we cast off that chill.

1384
01:07:28,256 --> 01:07:34,262
We illuminate the darkness
with fire and celebration.

1385
01:07:34,304 --> 01:07:38,183
So it's only fitting
that we would ask the family

1386
01:07:38,224 --> 01:07:42,896
of our newest Pere Noel,
Everett Bergeron,

1387
01:07:42,937 --> 01:07:45,315
to join us in the tradition

1388
01:07:45,357 --> 01:07:47,901
of calling out
the Christmas alligators

1389
01:07:47,942 --> 01:07:51,529
to welcome him back to Sorrento
and kick off Christmas.

1390
01:07:51,571 --> 01:07:53,573
Ladies, please.

1391
01:07:56,409 --> 01:07:58,661
Come on.
Come on.

1392
01:07:58,703 --> 01:08:00,372
Yeah. Okay.

1393
01:08:00,413 --> 01:08:02,540
- Wait, what is it again?
- It's like the book.

1394
01:08:02,582 --> 01:08:05,210
- Oh! Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
- You girls ready?

1395
01:08:05,251 --> 01:08:07,128
- Yes.
- All right, here we go.

1396
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:08,755
Ha, Gaston!

1397
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:10,173
Ha, Tiboy!

1398
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:11,966
Ha, Pierre an' Alcee'!

1399
01:08:12,008 --> 01:08:13,343
Gee, Ninette!

1400
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:15,303
Gee, Suzette!

1401
01:08:15,345 --> 01:08:17,555
Celeste an' Renee!

1402
01:08:17,597 --> 01:08:20,058
<i>Allons-y!</i>

1403
01:08:43,248 --> 01:08:44,791
There it is!

1404
01:08:50,171 --> 01:08:52,007
Merry Christmas, y'all!

1405
01:08:52,048 --> 01:08:54,217
Merry Christmas!

1406
01:08:57,053 --> 01:08:58,805
Happy holidays!

1407
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:01,683
Yohhhh!

1408
01:09:07,814 --> 01:09:09,816
Ho ho ho!

1409
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,031
Merry Christmas, y'all!

1410
01:09:16,072 --> 01:09:18,700
Merry Christmas!

1411
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:23,538
Hey-hey! Hey there, my girls!

1412
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:24,873
Merry Christmas.

1413
01:09:24,914 --> 01:09:27,584
Some candy canes
for my favorite girls.

1414
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:30,253
That's right, let's get
this Christmas party started!

1415
01:09:36,134 --> 01:09:39,054
This time of night
it's customary for Pere Noel

1416
01:09:39,095 --> 01:09:41,056
to make a little toast.

1417
01:09:41,097 --> 01:09:44,225
I'm sure Mayor Thomas has
already given a fine speech.

1418
01:09:44,267 --> 01:09:45,935
Exactly.

1419
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:52,525
But since it's tradition, I feel
obliged to carry the torch, so to speak.

1420
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:55,445
Now, this year you've
chosen me to be Pere Noel,

1421
01:09:55,487 --> 01:09:57,072
"the ultimate father figure,"

1422
01:09:57,113 --> 01:09:59,741
as a friend of mine once said.

1423
01:09:59,783 --> 01:10:01,463
Because at Christmas,
you know, as parents,

1424
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:03,745
we're busier
than ever, aren't we?

1425
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:06,414
You know, it's a time of year
when our love for them

1426
01:10:06,456 --> 01:10:08,291
really shines.

1427
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:10,627
It's a time when we remember

1428
01:10:10,669 --> 01:10:13,254
just how special that bond is.

1429
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:20,512
I haven't always been
a perfect man or perfect father,

1430
01:10:20,553 --> 01:10:23,306
but having kids has been
the greatest honor of my life,

1431
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:27,811
and if I ever accomplish anything on
this Earth, it will have been that,

1432
01:10:27,852 --> 01:10:32,565
so I would like to raise
a toast to my family, my girls,

1433
01:10:32,607 --> 01:10:35,026
my everything...

1434
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:38,822
and to you and yours,
wherever they may be.

1435
01:10:38,863 --> 01:10:40,156
Cheers!

1436
01:10:40,198 --> 01:10:42,617
Cheers!

1437
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:46,913
Whoo, whoo!

1438
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:48,748
Cheers, you guys.

1439
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:55,422
- Dad!
- Hey, how are y'all?

1440
01:10:55,463 --> 01:10:57,507
- How are ya?
- You did great, Dad.

1441
01:10:57,549 --> 01:10:59,634
Merry Chr... Thank you.
I practiced in the garage.

1442
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:01,344
I didn't want to tell anybody.

1443
01:11:01,386 --> 01:11:04,264
You can't have any of that.

1444
01:11:04,305 --> 01:11:05,974
Okay.

1445
01:11:06,016 --> 01:11:07,684
Okay, uh...

1446
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:10,311
Dad. No.

1447
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:11,730
That's so strong.

1448
01:11:11,771 --> 01:11:12,689
Uh...

1449
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:15,525
Okay, okay, Everett.

1450
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:17,986
I wanted to say
something to you and...

1451
01:11:18,028 --> 01:11:20,447
Hey. What are you doing
all the way out here?

1452
01:11:20,488 --> 01:11:23,366
Eh, nothing.

1453
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:25,035
Are you rehearsing?

1454
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:27,412
No.

1455
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:29,080
Maybe.

1456
01:11:29,122 --> 01:11:30,415
Okay, fine.

1457
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:33,543
You and Jennifer got in my head.

1458
01:11:33,585 --> 01:11:37,881
And... that speech
from Everett...

1459
01:11:37,922 --> 01:11:40,884
This is just such
an important night, and...

1460
01:11:40,925 --> 01:11:44,280
it's my last chance to tell him before I leave
tomorrow, and I don't want to mess it up.

1461
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:46,389
So speak from the heart.

1462
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:49,267
Listen, I was wrong, okay?

1463
01:11:49,309 --> 01:11:51,227
Don't think so much.

1464
01:11:51,269 --> 01:11:53,396
<i>Now</i> you tell me.

1465
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:55,565
Campbell...

1466
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:57,609
who wouldn't love you?

1467
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:04,032
I just...

1468
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:06,534
Once I tell him,
everything's going to change...

1469
01:12:06,576 --> 01:12:08,453
For the better.

1470
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:10,538
Yeah, I hope so.

1471
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:13,750
Jackson, you were
supposed to bring her back.

1472
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:16,628
I am now the rescue party
for the rescue party.

1473
01:12:18,171 --> 01:12:19,422
So, Campbell,

1474
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:21,007
there's sort of
a lull over there.

1475
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:23,134
I think now
might be a good time.

1476
01:12:27,347 --> 01:12:29,974
Yeah. Okay.

1477
01:12:30,016 --> 01:12:31,226
Yes.

1478
01:12:31,267 --> 01:12:32,894
Yeah.

1479
01:12:32,936 --> 01:12:34,145
I'm ready.

1480
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:37,273
- Cool.
- You got this.

1481
01:12:37,315 --> 01:12:38,650
Yep.

1482
01:12:42,654 --> 01:12:44,823
Why am I so nervous?

1483
01:12:44,864 --> 01:12:46,783
Because you love her too.

1484
01:12:48,493 --> 01:12:49,786
Aw.

1485
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:56,167
- Ooh, hey there.
- Hi.

1486
01:12:56,209 --> 01:12:58,378
All right, so...

1487
01:12:58,420 --> 01:12:59,879
what do you think of Sorrento?

1488
01:12:59,921 --> 01:13:03,800
Uh, compared to...
London, Paris?

1489
01:13:03,842 --> 01:13:06,428
Yeah, it's a special place,
that's for sure.

1490
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:08,138
I'm sad I have
to leave tomorrow.

1491
01:13:08,179 --> 01:13:09,889
We feel the same way.

1492
01:13:09,931 --> 01:13:11,599
Got enough for your article?

1493
01:13:11,641 --> 01:13:15,145
Uh, actually,
I was hoping to talk to you,

1494
01:13:15,186 --> 01:13:18,815
you know, kid to Pere Noel.

1495
01:13:18,857 --> 01:13:22,193
Uh... yeah, of course.

1496
01:13:22,235 --> 01:13:24,320
- What's up?
- Um...

1497
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:28,324
So, Everett, uh...

1498
01:13:28,366 --> 01:13:30,702
tonight in your speech,

1499
01:13:30,744 --> 01:13:34,873
you said that being a father was
the greatest honor of your life.

1500
01:13:34,914 --> 01:13:38,043
- Yeah.
- Yeah. And, um...

1501
01:13:38,084 --> 01:13:40,378
Dad, Campbell! We ran
into some fellow reporters

1502
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,130
all the way from Mississippi!

1503
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:44,424
- Oh!
- Pere Noel, if we could just get a few photos

1504
01:13:44,466 --> 01:13:46,509
of you and your family.

1505
01:13:46,551 --> 01:13:48,511
- Do you mind?
- Um...

1506
01:13:48,553 --> 01:13:50,347
Then we'll finish
our chat later?

1507
01:13:50,388 --> 01:13:52,015
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

1508
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:54,893
- Girls, what is all this?
- Oh, regional exposure, Mom.

1509
01:13:54,934 --> 01:13:56,728
Come on, get in the picture.

1510
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:58,748
Yeah, actually, if you can stand
right next to Pere Noel.

1511
01:13:58,772 --> 01:13:59,939
Oh, yeah.

1512
01:14:02,442 --> 01:14:04,569
- Campbell.
- Oh, no, this is great.

1513
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:06,112
Just the family's all we need.

1514
01:14:06,154 --> 01:14:07,989
All right.

1515
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:09,908
Everybody look here.

1516
01:14:09,949 --> 01:14:13,036
All right, get together
and say, "Hot chocolate!"

1517
01:14:13,078 --> 01:14:15,080
Hot chocolate!

1518
01:14:15,121 --> 01:14:18,083
Yeah, the mayor did a good job.

1519
01:14:21,628 --> 01:14:23,463
So sorry, I'll be right back.

1520
01:14:28,927 --> 01:14:31,262
Hey, slow down!
Where are you going?

1521
01:14:31,304 --> 01:14:34,557
- I need to go home.
- Okay, well then, give me a minute, I'll go with you.

1522
01:14:34,599 --> 01:14:36,434
No, I'm...

1523
01:14:36,476 --> 01:14:38,728
I'm going home.

1524
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:39,979
I'm sorry.

1525
01:14:40,021 --> 01:14:42,148
This was a huge mistake.

1526
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:45,193
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What happened?

1527
01:14:45,235 --> 01:14:47,404
- What did he say?
- I didn't tell him, okay?

1528
01:14:47,445 --> 01:14:51,241
- Oh, Campbell.
- And I ask that you please don't either.

1529
01:14:51,282 --> 01:14:54,119
I just... I don't know
what I was thinking.

1530
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:57,288
I have a family back in Dallas,
a great family, actually,

1531
01:14:57,330 --> 01:15:00,291
and, you know, maybe Everett not
coming back and not changing things

1532
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:02,085
was for the best.

1533
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:05,171
He left things alone, and maybe
I need to do the same thing.

1534
01:15:05,213 --> 01:15:07,090
Campbell.

1535
01:15:07,132 --> 01:15:10,051
Campbell!
Will you please just wait?

1536
01:15:10,093 --> 01:15:12,095
You need to let me go, Jackson.

1537
01:15:12,137 --> 01:15:14,639
This is your family,
your choice,

1538
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:16,391
but you're leaving behind
such a gift.

1539
01:15:16,433 --> 01:15:18,018
It's so much more complicated
than that.

1540
01:15:18,059 --> 01:15:20,437
Of course it's complicated,
it's family.

1541
01:15:20,478 --> 01:15:21,771
I get it.

1542
01:15:21,813 --> 01:15:24,274
But they obviously
care about you.

1543
01:15:24,315 --> 01:15:26,026
Maybe if you just
told them the truth.

1544
01:15:26,067 --> 01:15:28,611
Maybe not all family
is meant to be.

1545
01:15:28,653 --> 01:15:30,280
Yes.

1546
01:15:30,321 --> 01:15:32,657
But can you honestly spend
the rest of your life

1547
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:34,200
knowing what you left
behind here?

1548
01:15:46,254 --> 01:15:48,256
Campbell, hi, it's me again.

1549
01:15:48,298 --> 01:15:50,258
Uh, merry Christmas.

1550
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,843
We, uh, missed you last night,

1551
01:15:51,885 --> 01:15:54,054
and I was just calling to see
if you're all right

1552
01:15:54,095 --> 01:15:57,682
and to let you know that the offer
for Christmas breakfast still stands.

1553
01:15:57,724 --> 01:15:59,934
Um, give us a call.

1554
01:15:59,976 --> 01:16:01,186
Bye.

1555
01:16:01,227 --> 01:16:03,146
She'll call.

1556
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:05,440
I don't know,
maybe she finished her story.

1557
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:08,360
I just feel bad for the girls. I mean,
they really took a liking to her.

1558
01:16:08,401 --> 01:16:13,239
I did too. I mean, do you really think
she would leave without saying goodbye?

1559
01:16:13,281 --> 01:16:14,991
Hey, it's Jackson.

1560
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:17,452
- In the kitchen.
- Is it her?

1561
01:16:17,494 --> 01:16:18,912
Is she here?!

1562
01:16:18,953 --> 01:16:21,790
Merry Christmas,
Bergeron family.

1563
01:16:21,831 --> 01:16:23,917
- Oh, it's just you.
- Be nice.

1564
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:27,712
It's okay, I get it. Campbell was a
very special person, I'd be sad too.

1565
01:16:27,754 --> 01:16:30,965
Luckily for you, though,
you don't have to be.

1566
01:16:31,007 --> 01:16:34,135
- Oh! Hey!
- Merry Christmas!

1567
01:16:34,177 --> 01:16:36,805
Merry Christmas!

1568
01:16:36,846 --> 01:16:38,723
Hello!

1569
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:40,975
- Hello.
- See?

1570
01:16:41,017 --> 01:16:43,204
I told everyone you wouldn't
leave without saying goodbye.

1571
01:16:43,228 --> 01:16:45,230
- Never!
- We were worried you ran off.

1572
01:16:45,271 --> 01:16:48,191
And miss all this? No way.

1573
01:16:48,233 --> 01:16:50,318
I just couldn't come
to Christmas morning

1574
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,822
without getting
some presents, and, uh...

1575
01:16:53,863 --> 01:16:56,199
my story is far from over.

1576
01:16:58,993 --> 01:17:02,080
Oh, and if anyone's wondering
if the big-box store out on I-10

1577
01:17:02,122 --> 01:17:06,001
is open at 2 a.m.
on Christmas Eve... it is.

1578
01:17:06,042 --> 01:17:07,919
Come on, now. Let's eat.

1579
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,462
Give me those!

1580
01:17:09,504 --> 01:17:11,589
- Oh!
- Merry Christmas.

1581
01:17:11,631 --> 01:17:12,757
Thank you.

1582
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:16,177
All right, girls,
put those under the tree,

1583
01:17:16,219 --> 01:17:18,054
and, uh, yeah, Jackson,
grab a seat.

1584
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:19,806
Campbell, grab a seat.

1585
01:17:22,517 --> 01:17:25,186
- Juice!
- -All right, grab one and pass it down.

1586
01:17:25,228 --> 01:17:27,188
- Thank you.
- Gravy's on the side.

1587
01:17:33,486 --> 01:17:35,822
They're beautiful!
Thank you.

1588
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:39,200
- You're welcome.
- Okay, so, last but not least...

1589
01:17:39,242 --> 01:17:42,912
Okay.
Uh... Mary-Margaret.

1590
01:17:42,954 --> 01:17:44,706
Oh, for me?

1591
01:17:44,748 --> 01:17:45,748
Yes.

1592
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:50,587
For your budding
influencer career.

1593
01:17:52,213 --> 01:17:54,841
Seriously? Oh, my goodness.

1594
01:17:54,883 --> 01:17:57,385
I love it. Thank you!

1595
01:17:57,427 --> 01:17:59,220
Oh!

1596
01:17:59,262 --> 01:18:01,639
I thought you might.

1597
01:18:01,681 --> 01:18:02,724
Thank you so much.

1598
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:04,476
Amelia.

1599
01:18:10,565 --> 01:18:12,359
A place to put your thoughts.

1600
01:18:13,818 --> 01:18:15,195
I have a lot of thoughts.

1601
01:18:17,238 --> 01:18:20,492
Uh, okay, and, Jennifer.

1602
01:18:20,533 --> 01:18:22,369
- One for you.
- Oh, wow, me too?

1603
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:24,662
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

1604
01:18:30,001 --> 01:18:31,920
It's our saying!

1605
01:18:31,961 --> 01:18:34,464
Yeah, well,
he shared your story with me,

1606
01:18:34,506 --> 01:18:36,966
and I was... inspired.

1607
01:18:37,008 --> 01:18:39,761
Oh, thank you so much.

1608
01:18:39,803 --> 01:18:41,262
Look at that.

1609
01:18:41,304 --> 01:18:42,972
You're good at this.

1610
01:18:43,014 --> 01:18:45,100
That is so sweet!

1611
01:18:45,141 --> 01:18:46,476
And, um...

1612
01:18:48,019 --> 01:18:51,022
Uh... Everett, yours is

1613
01:18:51,064 --> 01:18:53,024
the only one I didn't buy.

1614
01:19:12,168 --> 01:19:13,169
You can't be.

1615
01:19:13,211 --> 01:19:15,255
She...

1616
01:19:15,296 --> 01:19:17,632
my baby girl had darker hair

1617
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:19,968
and a little crooked tooth.

1618
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:21,720
Yeah, right in the front.

1619
01:19:26,307 --> 01:19:27,726
Alice?

1620
01:19:32,188 --> 01:19:33,982
I should have told you
the truth sooner,

1621
01:19:34,024 --> 01:19:36,026
but I needed...

1622
01:19:36,067 --> 01:19:38,153
I thought...

1623
01:19:38,194 --> 01:19:39,738
Everett.

1624
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:45,952
Campbell, I'm so sorry.

1625
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:47,954
Mama, what... what was it?

1626
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:52,625
- Is she crying?
- It's okay.

1627
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:54,794
No, it's fine.
I'm fine. I just, um...

1628
01:19:54,836 --> 01:19:56,755
- Campbell.
- We should get going anyway.

1629
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:02,093
I... I have loved
every minute of my time here,

1630
01:20:02,135 --> 01:20:03,803
and all of you are, uh...

1631
01:20:03,845 --> 01:20:05,638
Wait, hang on.

1632
01:20:10,268 --> 01:20:12,812
Don't go.

1633
01:20:12,854 --> 01:20:14,606
What's this?

1634
01:20:14,647 --> 01:20:17,067
It's a gift, for you.

1635
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:23,823
When I left,
I thought I was protecting you.

1636
01:20:23,865 --> 01:20:25,492
I thought it was
the right thing to do,

1637
01:20:25,533 --> 01:20:27,369
and I wanted you to know it

1638
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:29,204
and to know how much
I missed you.

1639
01:20:29,245 --> 01:20:31,748
And so I sent some letters.

1640
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:35,168
But we moved
and we changed our name.

1641
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,419
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1642
01:20:36,461 --> 01:20:38,171
And, uh,
when the letters came back,

1643
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:40,006
I...

1644
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:43,218
bought a notebook,
and I wrote in that instead,

1645
01:20:43,259 --> 01:20:46,888
everything that I was thinking,
everything that I was feeling,

1646
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:51,935
all the regret and sorrow
and apologies and...

1647
01:20:51,976 --> 01:20:53,770
I wrote every day.

1648
01:20:53,812 --> 01:20:56,856
It's a lifetime
of days spent missing you

1649
01:20:56,898 --> 01:20:58,149
and loving you.

1650
01:21:12,163 --> 01:21:14,082
I thought you didn't want me.

1651
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:17,043
No. Never.

1652
01:21:17,085 --> 01:21:19,129
I am so sorry.

1653
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:26,094
I just... I can't believe
that you're really here.

1654
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:28,096
I can't believe it, either.

1655
01:21:29,639 --> 01:21:32,058
Jennifer, you were
in on this, weren't you?

1656
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:35,854
Yes.
But I had help from Jackson.

1657
01:21:35,895 --> 01:21:38,523
What can I say, I love to keep
the town family records complete.

1658
01:21:38,565 --> 01:21:40,775
Uh-huh.

1659
01:21:40,817 --> 01:21:44,154
Um, could somebody please
explain what's going on?

1660
01:21:44,195 --> 01:21:45,780
Yeah, why is everyone crying?

1661
01:21:45,822 --> 01:21:47,866
Well, uh, girls,

1662
01:21:47,907 --> 01:21:51,870
uh, years ago,
I had another daughter,

1663
01:21:51,911 --> 01:21:53,830
your older sister.

1664
01:21:55,331 --> 01:21:58,626
And Campbell...

1665
01:21:58,668 --> 01:22:01,296
- Wait, she's our sister?
- I knew it!

1666
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:03,548
- You did not!
- I had a hunch.

1667
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:05,925
Oh, a hunch!

1668
01:22:05,967 --> 01:22:08,053
Okay, so I'm not the oldest?

1669
01:22:08,094 --> 01:22:09,971
I guess not.

1670
01:22:10,013 --> 01:22:12,766
Wait, so if you're our sister,
then that means...

1671
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:18,772
That's a great idea.

1672
01:22:21,524 --> 01:22:24,611
The secret ingredient.

1673
01:22:24,652 --> 01:22:27,030
We only share it with family.

1674
01:22:27,072 --> 01:22:29,908
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1675
01:22:31,743 --> 01:22:33,745
Oh, I gotta get a piece of this.

1676
01:22:33,787 --> 01:22:36,998
Come on, now.

1677
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,583
Oh, Jackson, come in.

1678
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:41,211
Come in.

1679
01:22:41,252 --> 01:22:44,506
- Come on in! Come on!
- All right.

1680
01:22:44,547 --> 01:22:46,299
All right, merry Christmas on 3.

1681
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:48,009
1, 2, 3!

1682
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:50,053
Merry Christmas!

1683
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:52,806
Yeah, that's a good one.

1684
01:22:52,847 --> 01:22:56,976
<i>Ever since that fateful Christmas,
I get asked a lot of things.</i>

1685
01:22:57,018 --> 01:22:59,896
<i>"What did it feel like
to meet your father?"</i>

1686
01:22:59,938 --> 01:23:03,983
<i>"Are your sisters
really that cool?"</i>

1687
01:23:04,025 --> 01:23:06,444
<i>"What made you go back
on Christmas morning?"</i>

1688
01:23:06,486 --> 01:23:09,072
<i>And "Is Jackson
as cute as he sounds?"</i>

1689
01:23:10,865 --> 01:23:12,617
<i>And all those
are fair questions,</i>

1690
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:16,705
<i>but the question I get asked
the most often is,</i>

1691
01:23:16,746 --> 01:23:19,207
<i>"What happened next?"</i>

1692
01:23:19,249 --> 01:23:21,292
<i>What happened after my first</i>

1693
01:23:21,334 --> 01:23:24,504
<i>Louisiana family Christmas?</i>

1694
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:26,506
<i>Well, that's easy.</i>

1695
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:28,049
<i>Everything.</i>

01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:29,384
<i>♪ ...and spend it</i>
