00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,769
This is so amazing

185
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,354
but I actually have the
Lancaster call this morning.

186
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,355
Can I take a rain check?

187
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,815
A rain check.

188
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,816
Uh... sure.

189
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:04,817
Great.

190
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,444
Uh, well. But how about...
a latte?

191
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,946
I love this little heart.

192
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,322
It's a little heart.

193
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,699
Oh, you know what?

194
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,868
Kyle... Kyle was grabbing
coffees on his way in.

195
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,578
But I feel so bad that you
went through all this trouble.

196
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,163
I mean, I...

197
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,331
I'm gonna take a little sip.
I'm gonna take a little sip.

198
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,166
[phone ringing]

199
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,834
That's okay.

200
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:22,835
- I'm totally fine with that.
- Wait, I have to take this.

201
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,670
Kyle! I was just talking
about you.

202
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,839
You ready to crush it?
I'll see you tonight.

203
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,090
Hey...

204
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,675
[Birdie] You literally
finished my sentence,

205
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,093
that is exactly what
I was thinking.

206
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,805
We are so on the same page.

207
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,145
Just make something up 'cause
I don't wanna talk to him now.

208
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,355
Yo! Yo, the bird looking sharp.

209
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,732
You ready for this?

210
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,650
[in unison] Breaking necks
and cashing checks.

211
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,069
Thank you very much.

212
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,699
Mmm! Cinnamon.
Living on the edge.

213
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,076
[in unison] Game time.

214
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:56,994
[humming]

215
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,748
[reporter on radio] The case
of famed Boston crime boss

216
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,709
Orleans McGuiness continues
to unfold.

217
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,960
Police are now reporting

218
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,255
that this is an active
homicide investigation.

219
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,549
And that's the news
for this hour.

220
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,636
Coming up, a rare B-side from
the late Danny “Teardrops” Page.

221
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,848
Paid in full.

222
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,268
Okay, Gambot 200.

223
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,607
It is time for you to go
to your forever home.

224
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,944
You know, I think you're gonna
like Cincinnati.

225
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,823
Terrible chili but the people
are great.

226
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,745
Godspeed old friend.

227
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,919
Oh Kyle, your coffee's so great.
Is that cardamom in there?

228
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,963
Does everything you touch
smell like unicorns?

229
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,680
[keyboard tapping]

230
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,018
[garage door opens]

231
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,319
[speakerphone] Our position
from the beginning

232
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,155
was to have this resolved
in a reasonable fashion.

233
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,323
We understand that.

234
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,117
We believe 3.5 is
more than reasonable.

235
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,660
[speakerphone] You know three
million was our ceiling.

236
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,744
No. Up, up.

237
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,579
Now you have a new ceiling.

238
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,248
[speakerphone] Our client does not
think anything over three million

239
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,001
is in their best interest.

240
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,795
That's fine.

241
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,674
We can always see
what a jury thinks.

242
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,176
[speakerphone] Fine.
We'll make 3.5 work.

243
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,722
Great. We'll send over
the paperwork this afternoon.

244
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,349
Dream team strikes again.
Huh, huh?

245
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,102
[grunting in unison]

246
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,228
Yes!

247
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,354
Where'd we land?

248
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,480
3.5.

249
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,481
And on the first round.

250
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,607
Yes.

251
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,650
[laughing]

252
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,028
But didn't they start at three?

253
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,613
Paula, can you get the
champagne from my fridge?

254
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,825
This calls for a celebration.

255
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,452
Thank you so much, Tim.

256
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,078
These paralegals.

257
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,413
They file two forms, they think
they're Erin Brockovich.

258
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,414
[laughing]

259
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,999
Ms. Case?

260
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,001
Ms. Perez would like to see you
in her office in five minutes.

261
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,586
Well, I guess, good news
travels fast.

262
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,920
As it should.
She's gonna love this.

263
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,464
This is how you make partner.

264
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,631
I'm grabbing
the expensive stuff.

265
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,592
Uh huh.

266
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:16,843
[laughs]

267
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,677
- Well done.
- Thank you, Tim.

268
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,096
That's how you do it.

269
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,681
Thank you Leslie.

270
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,932
Teamwork, right?

271
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,810
Teamwork makes the dream work.

272
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,855
We did it.

273
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,815
Shut the door.

274
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,071
What was that?

275
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,198
This is not how
you make partner.

276
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,533
We got them half a million
dollars over their ceiling.

277
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,411
$3.5 million is a disgrace.

278
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,871
3.5 is fair.

279
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,874
We are not in the business
of fair.

280
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,209
We are in the business
of extracting

281
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,671
everything we can
until there is nothing left.

282
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,672
Kyle and I thought that this...

283
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:55,882
Listen...

284
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,385
I like Kyle.

285
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,679
He's a good worker bee.

286
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,014
But making partner
isn't in his future.

287
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,350
It is in yours so long
as you pull it together

288
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,143
and start acting like a killer.

289
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,269
But Mom...

290
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,981
I am not your mom
when we're at work.

291
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:17,319
I am your boss.
And I need you to step up.

292
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,570
Understood?

293
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,989
Understood.

294
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,517
Krshnit?

295
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,936
Oh... crushing it.

296
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,480
[blows raspberry]

297
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,655
11:27 AM.

298
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:06,285
Target said vehicle identified.

299
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,954
Brotastic.

302
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,054
[Birdie] Hey babe.

303
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:25,179
Hey.

304
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,306
How did the, uh...
how did the call go?

305
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,557
[Birdie] Fine.

306
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,808
[Alden] Was your mom pleased?

307
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,645
My boss wasn't exactly
thrilled, no.

308
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,607
What's new?
[chuckles]

309
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:41,320
Um... hey, uh... so, uh...
I'm thinking about, you know,

310
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:45,366
going with some of the guys
to happy hour tonight.

311
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,617
Um...

312
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,494
Hey. I'm out.
I'll see you tomorrow.

313
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,329
[Birdie] Okay.

314
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:49,996
Okay. Those are gross.

315
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,581
Uh, no. I'm good.

316
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,625
Okay. Well, don't wait up.

317
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,251
You know how hard CPAs
like to party.

318
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,212
[Birdie] Mmhmm.

319
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:58,922
Okay. Bye.

I'm Kyle.

Goodnight, Tim.

333
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,848
Oh, Birdie. Good night.

334
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,558
I didn't think anybody
was still here.

335
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,268
You're taking off soon?

336
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,561
Tonight feels like one of
those nights

337
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,604
I'm never gonna leave.

338
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,980
Ugh, I hear you.

339
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,023
[chuckles]

340
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,609
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

341
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,196
Hey. Today was still a win.

342
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,530
I know Eleonore can be tough

343
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,492
but you did right
by your client today.

344
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,951
That's the best we can do.

345
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,454
I don't know. Sometimes
I just question it all.

346
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,122
We all do.

347
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,708
You just gotta live
to fight another day.

348
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,128
Thanks Tim, that means a lot.

349
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,922
Get outta here. Good night.

00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,347
This is Tim speaking.

352
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,646
A new suit.

353
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,148
Fancy boy.

00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:27,695
My name's Kyle.

355
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,822

Come on.

00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:32,427
Ugh!

366
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,473
[car shuts off]
[sighs]

367
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,145
<i>Ilm Kyle, I run out of
buildings at full speed.</i>

368
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,565
Guess I'm going in.

369
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:51,028
[suspenseful music]

370
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,447
Hello?

371
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,452
Hello?

372
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:08,505
Barf.

373
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,385
What's that all about?

374
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:28,650
Divorce?

375
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,156
[phone chiming]

376
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,535
Hello?

377
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,415
Somebody here?

378
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,839
[phone continues chiming]

379
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,682
Tim?

380
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:06,396
[dramatic music heightens]

381
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,817
Oh no! Oh no!!

382
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:12,694
Freeze!

383
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:13,820
[screams]

384
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,863
Let me see your hands.

385
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,365
It's not what you think.

386
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,075
How do you know what I think?

387
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,077
[gags]
Yeah.

388
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,705
[vomits]

389
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,249
Eww.

390
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,507
[sirens wailing]

391
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:36,968
Ah.

392
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,429
Your blood pressure's
a little high.

393
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,931
You been under
any stress lately?

394
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,102
Slightly more than usual, yeah.

395
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,487
[mysterious music]

396
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,741
Mr. Case... let me
get this straight.

397
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:03,243
You followed a Mr. Henicker, Kyle,

398
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:07,247
back to the office because
you were "doing homework"

399
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:11,085
for your "private
investigation class"

400
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:14,588
'cause he bought
your wife "coffee".

401
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,006
Did I miss anything?

402
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,217
I don't appreciate your liberal
use of air quotes

403
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:22,638
but aside from that,
it's correct, yeah.

404
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:23,848
[Birdie] Alden?

405
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:25,891
[Alden] Oh.

406
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,059
Are you okay?

407
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,061
Yeah.

408
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,521
Is that Tim?

409
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:31,522
Yeah.

410
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,442
Wait, what are you doing here?

411
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,445
Err... I...

412
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,620
[sighs]

413
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,248
Say something.

414
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:53,711
A few hours ago Tim was giving
me some really kind advice

415
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:58,173
and then I got in my car
and I drove home

416
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,510
thinking that my husband
was out networking

417
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,012
with other aspiring accountants

418
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,305
because that's what
he told me he was doing.

419
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,266
Yeah.

420
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:08,892
And now Tim is dead

421
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:14,148
and my husband has been lying
to me for four months.

422
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,150
Four months about where
he spends his nights.

423
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,819
I... I don't... I don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

424
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,155
I'm so sorry that you had
to find out this way.

425
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,741
I... I was... I was trying
to tell you this morning

426
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:25,743
and then you...
you rushed out.

427
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,328
To work, Alden!
I had to get to work.

428
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,456
That's not fair.

429
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,624
You're right.
You're right.

430
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,168
I thought we agreed.

431
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,003
I thought we agreed that
accounting was stable

432
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,963
and consistent which is
what we need for you

433
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,090
after your whole crypto
currency debacle.

434
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,800
You promised that
you would play it safe.

435
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,969
Okay. All of the blogs said
that crypto mining

436
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,846
was a solid investment.

437
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,015
But we are still paying it off, Alden.

438
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,184
You promised!
You promised!

439
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,352
I know.

440
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,353
That you would find
something reliable.

441
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,979
I know.

442
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,109
And... and I tried accounting.
I just couldn't do it.

443
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,444
And then across the hall

444
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,113
they had this Intro to
Private Investigation.

445
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:06,951
So I went over and, I don't
know, something clicked.

446
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:12,831
Accounting is just not my thing.

447
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,208
It's just not your thing?

448
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,835
Alden, this isn't a college
job fair.

449
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:17,962
Okay.

450
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,133
I really don't wanna be the wife
that nags you all the time.

451
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,135
I don't.

452
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,055
I love you but I just...

453
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:31,059
you keep making promises

454
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,063
and then you break them.

455
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:42,946
Okay. Uh...

456
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:46,741
Going good.
There we go.

457
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:49,076
Oh. Okay.
No. No, no, no.

458
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,328
No. No, no, no.
No. No.

459
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,622
Off. Off. Off.

460
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,416
Oh boy.
Okay. Come on, come on.

461
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,750
Off. Off. Okay. Okay.

462
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,419
- Hey. Hey.
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

463
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,421
No, no, no. I know, I know.
I know, I got it.

464
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,582
You're gonna burn yourself.
You're gonna burn yourself.

465
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:07,345
I had it.

466
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,057
[sighs]

467
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:16,688
Sorry.
I know how well you knew Tim.

468
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,567
I'm not sure I know anyone
well these days.

469
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,782
Any, uh... any more updates?

470
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,617
Apparently suicide.

471
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,327
Hmm.

472
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,829
So tragic.

473
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,414
It really is.

474
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,415
It's just...

475
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,668
well, I mean, it doesn't explain
why Kyle ran away

476
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,795
before the cops came.

477
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,505
You know?

478
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,508
Innocent people don't run.

479
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:57,812
How are you doing?

480
00:23:57,813 --> 00:23:59,438
Still processing.

481
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,106
I know this is tough

482
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,442
but we need to think about
the big picture here.

483
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,278
We need to assure our clients,
our future clients

484
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,864
and our employees that
everything is under control.

485
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,407
Yeah, that makes sense.

486
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,993
But we're not expected to do
anything today, right?

487
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,953
Well, people will be
looking for us

488
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,663
to guide them through this.

489
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:20,000
Tim wasn't just a partner,
he was a real leader,

490
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,835
and now someone's gotta
fill that void.

491
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,545
I need it to be you.

492
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,838
Okay. I can do that.

493
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,257
Good. Now...

494
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,052
as your mother asking...

495
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,429
how are you and Alden?

496
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,057
I don't know, Mom.

497
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:37,518
I mean, the jealousy
with Kyle was one thing.

498
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,355
But this lying about taking
a PI class

499
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:44,149
has just taken things
to a whole other level.

500
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,737
It's... I don't even know
who my own husband is anymore.

501
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,656
I thought you'd be relieved.

502
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,616
Usually when a husband lies
about where he is

503
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:56,036
it's because he's with another
woman or man.

504
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,246
For better or worse,

505
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,289
your husband lied
about night school.

506
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,376
So what, he's just gonna become
a private investigator now?

507
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:06,046
Let me ask you this,
has he seemed happier lately?

508
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,589
I don't know.

509
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,383
Have you asked?

510
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:10,427
[knock on door]

511
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,512
A couple of us were thinking
about going out

512
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:16,056
for drinks tonight
in honor of Tim.

513
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,726
Would it be okay if I sent out
a companywide email?

514
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:19,727
Of course.

515
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:21,562
Thanks Paula.

516
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,065
Anything more from the police?

517
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,234
Suicide, open and shut.

518
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:28,861
Why?

519
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,696
I mean, did Tim seem depressed
to you?

520
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:31,698
Nuh uh.

521
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:33,824
Was he having money problems?

522
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:34,908
Oh no.

523
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,660
[chuckles]
Tim was very wealthy.

524
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:40,706
His position here was more
for status than for a paycheck.

525
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,500
It just doesn't make any sense.

526
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,294
Well I've learned that people
often only show us

527
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:46,796
what they want us to see.

528
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,466
I know this is tough.

529
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,217
Chin up.

530
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,511
Everyone's watching.

531
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,315
[sighs]

532
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:09,109
Our win seems like a million
years ago, doesn't it?

533
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,319
[clears throat]

534
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,945
Yeah.

535
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,156
This is really hitting home, huh?

536
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:16,659
Yeah. I mean, it's just...
it's such a shock.

537
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:20,496
You know, I came in today

538
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:23,416
thinking it was just another
work day and then...

539
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,293
Paula, she told me what happened

540
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:28,754
and I just... I can't
believe it.

541
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:29,963
Paula told you?

542
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:33,175
Yeah, this morning. Why?

543
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:36,513
No, you're right.
That is unbelievable.

544
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,810
Well... hang in there.

545
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:46,690

00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:45,436
Tim struggled for years
with who he was.

725
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:48,605
He finally was comfortable
in his own skin.

726
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:51,942
Was he having trouble
with anybody or...?

727
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:53,819
There's one thing that comes
to mind.

728
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,280
There was an incident at the
apartments he was representing

729
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:58,073
for the new owners.

730
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:00,284
The Cecil Bay Apartments?

731
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,036
That sounds right.

732
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:05,831
He said it was sadly something
to do with redevelopment

733
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:09,501
or some such and that when they
handed out the eviction notices

734
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:12,296
he was threatened by one
of the tenants there.

735
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:13,714
He didn't go into much detail

736
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:17,801
but something gave him
quite a fright.

737
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:18,886
Hmm.

738
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:20,012

of questioning

739

official capacity.

in any way,

in some sort of lawsuit

760

an argument in the driveway.

761

What happened?
Did he get violent? Physical?

762
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:22,533
Bill didn't get out of the car.
But there was a lot of yelling.

763
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:23,867
What was the lawsuit about?

764
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:28,414
I don't know.
But they were both very angry.

765
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:29,999

day or night, preferably day.

Well as much as I do love their
Cobb salad, I just can't.

I don't have time.

775
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:51,437
Since when have you been
to the yacht club?

776
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:52,771
Lots of times.
They're our clients.

777

I can't. Eleonore's breathing

Actually... that's perfect.

783
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,076
The Cecil Bay Apartments
have new owners

784
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:08,579
and they wanna turn them
into high-end condos.

785
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,955
Tim was dealing with
the current tenants,

786
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:11,874
trying to get them out nicely.

787
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,917
Well, that sounds like a recipe
for bad blood.

788
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:16,628
We definitely need
to get those files.

No. No, no, no.
No one's going over any files.

could have a friendly
little chat.

for my ex-wife?

No.

I thought you said this
was gonna be a friendly chat.

Oh. So I see you've heard
the news?

I heard he checked out early.

But you have another.

Rumor has it you and he had
a pretty heated argument.

818

Oh yeah, I wanted to murder him.

that sued me,

with the gun in her nightgown?

as strange.

spook him.

00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:40,452
everybody had a motive
to want Tim gone.

899
00:43:40,453 --> 00:43:42,538
And our working theory
is that same person

900
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:45,207
went to Tim's office three days
later, killed him,

901
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,458
making it look like a suicide.

902
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:48,127
Exactly.

903
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:50,129
We've been able to definitively
rule out 12 out of 15 tenants

904
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,380
for various reasons.

905
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:53,298
Either lack of means
or opportunity or both.

906
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:55,718
Which leaves us three
potential suspects.

907
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:57,094
Right.

908
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:59,805
Number one.
Francis Taylor.

909
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:00,973
[camera shutter snaps]

910
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,349
Apartment 201.

911
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:04,435
Now this guy was convicted
of manslaughter in 1982,

912
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:05,978
he served 12 years,

913
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:07,438
he's been living in
the building ever since.

914
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:08,814
He's been employed
as a counsellor

915
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:10,274
for newly released inmates,

916
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:11,900
helping them get adjusted
to their new lives.

917
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:14,737
It's possible he did it.
I don't see it.

918
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:15,822
I don't either.

919
00:44:17,365 --> 00:44:20,617
And then we have the old lady
with a gun in her nightgown.

920
00:44:20,618 --> 00:44:22,119
[camera shutter snaps]

921
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,288
Eugenia Carmopolis,
apartment 112.

922
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:26,749
She does have a concealed carry
permit so she has the means.

923
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,543
Only problem is
she's legally blind.

924
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:30,712
Which leaves us...

925
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:32,838
Frederick Gasko.

926
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:34,089
[camera shutter snaps]

927
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,466
Apartment 101.

928
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:37,760
Now Mr. Gasko is the only tenant
in the building

929
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:41,847
who pays his rent in cash
and the only picture on file

930
00:44:41,848 --> 00:44:43,932
is from a driver's license
from 1989.

931
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:45,768
Which I think we both agree
is totally fake.

932
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:47,144
For sure.

933
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:48,270
I can't believe they spelled
Massachusetts wrong.

934
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:49,605
I mean, how do you get away
with that?

935
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:51,023
No, I think that's actually
the real crime here.

936
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:52,733
But the question is...

937
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:55,361
why does Mr. Gasko
need a fake ID?

938
00:44:55,362 --> 00:45:02,076
Perhaps it's because Frederick
Gasko and Lean McGuiness

939
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:04,036
are the same person.

940
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:05,704
It does look like him.

941
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:08,040
Because it is him.

942
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:11,126
One of America's most dangerous
mobsters, on the run, 30 years,

943
00:45:11,127 --> 00:45:12,461
hiding in plain sight.

944
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,838
Lean McGuiness killed Tim
because he was about

945
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:17,758
to blow his cover and kick him
out of his hiding spot.

946
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:20,052
Mic drop.
That's the game.

947
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:21,553
Happy birthday!

948
00:45:21,554 --> 00:45:22,888
Hold up.

949
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:23,931
I'm bumping on one thing.

950
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:25,016
What?

951
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:29,228
Lean McGuiness' body was
discovered before Tim died.

952
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:31,815
How does a dead man kill Tim?

953
00:45:32,732 --> 00:45:34,483
[groans]

954
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:36,402
Okay, that's actually
a really good point.

955
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,320
I'm not sure but there has to be
a connection.

956
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:39,321
Come on!

957
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:41,073
There's no way
it's a coincidence

958
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:42,908
that Tim very likely
discovered Lean

959
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:46,161
and then both Tim and Lean were
found dead within the same week.

960
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:47,413
It does seem unlikely.

961
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:48,580
Come on.

962
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:51,250
Just acknowledge
we're onto something here.

963
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:55,714
Alden Case, you are becoming
quite the investigator.

964
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:05,932
[machine frothing]

965
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:09,852
You're up early.
Did you get any sleep?

966
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:12,980
Actually, I woke up in
the middle of the night

967
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:14,732
with an idea.

968
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:18,652
I know... what we need to do.

969
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:20,404
- Veggie omelets?
- Mmhmm.

970
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:21,530
- Kiwis.
- Yes.

971
00:46:21,531 --> 00:46:24,617
- Strawberries and pancakes?
- Correct.

972
00:46:26,077 --> 00:46:27,911
What are you
buttering me up for?

973
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:29,830
Hear me out.

974
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:32,333
I think we need to visit
the Cecil Bay Apartments

975
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:34,251
and see if Frederick Gasko
is there.

976
00:46:34,252 --> 00:46:36,879
Whoa! That's a big step,
don't you think?

977
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,422
You saw the pictures.

978
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:40,966
Frederick Gasko is Lean McGuiness.
It's the same person.

979
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:42,593
Yes, they do look alike. Okay.

980
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:46,638
But I think the safest thing
to do would be to call the FBI

981
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:47,681
and tell them what we think.

982
00:46:47,682 --> 00:46:49,266
Argh!

983
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:50,434
They are still investigating
what happened to Lean McGuiness.

984
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:51,685
We don't wanna get
in the middle of that.

985
00:46:51,686 --> 00:46:52,687
Okay.

986
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:57,983
Before we do that,
how about this?

987
00:46:57,984 --> 00:47:00,277
We go to the apartments,
we knock on the door,

988
00:47:00,278 --> 00:47:03,155
if Frederick Gasko answers,
that's it I quit, game over.

989
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:04,490
And if he doesn't answer?

990
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:06,492
If Gasko's not there,
we call the FBI,

991
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:07,618
we tell them what we know.

992
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:09,119
And you will stand down?

993
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,914
I will hand the information
over to the fancy people

994
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:15,834
with their badges. Promise.

995
00:47:15,835 --> 00:47:16,960
Let me think about it.

996
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:18,253
I have this meeting
at 10:00 AM

997
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:19,755
that I am not looking
forward to.

998
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:22,508
Oh yeah, I bet.
I bet you do.

999
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:25,719
Meetings are tough.
You just think about it. Okay?

1000
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,887
Mmhmm.

1001
00:47:26,888 --> 00:47:27,806
Just think about it.

1002
00:47:27,807 --> 00:47:29,973
That's... that's excellent.

1003
00:47:29,974 --> 00:47:31,725
You got a lot of knots
back here, what's going on?

1004
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:33,103
I know. Oh God.

1005
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:36,563
Yes, I know.
100 percent, Mr. Keller.

1006
00:47:36,564 --> 00:47:38,399
I mean, we're very excited,
you know.

1007
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,067
We can't wait
for the next steps.

1008
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:42,319
Thanks Ben, chat soon.

1009
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,196
[phone beeps]

1010
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:44,531
Wait, was that the Keller call?

1011
00:47:45,573 --> 00:47:47,032
I thought it was at 10:00.

1012
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:48,659
It got moved to 9:00.
I thought you knew that.

1013
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,327
Kyle, great work.

1014
00:47:50,328 --> 00:47:52,163
Start putting together
your proposal.

1015
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:54,624
I'm on it.

1016
00:47:56,751 --> 00:47:58,877
Doesn't feel good, does it?

1017
00:47:58,878 --> 00:48:01,005
You did this on purpose.

1018
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:03,841
Kyle isn't half the lawyer
you are.

1019
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:05,385
But he's hungry.

1020
00:48:13,893 --> 00:48:17,647
Hey. Let's do this.
Pick me up at 6:00

1021
00:48:22,777 --> 00:48:23,777
This is it.

1022
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,286
I can't decide if I want Gasko
to be home or not.

1023
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:35,289
Okay. So we are just knocking
on the door, Alden.

1024
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,207
And if he doesn't answer...

1025
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:38,167
I will stand down.

1026
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:39,710
Okay, let's do this.

1027
00:48:39,711 --> 00:48:40,711
One sec.

1028
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:43,381
Fake mustache.

1029
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:45,007
Why would you need
a fake mustache?

1030
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:46,133
So no one knows who we are.

1031
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:47,968
No one knows who we are anyway!

1032
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:49,304
Exactly.

1033
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:52,098
Alden.

1034
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:54,767
Hmm?

1035
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:56,393
[chuckles]

1036
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:58,187
Wait, wait, wait.
What's with the hat?

1037
00:48:58,188 --> 00:48:59,606
Come on, rookie.

1038
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:02,108
Oy vey.

1039
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:05,235
I can't believe
we're doing this.

1040
00:49:05,236 --> 00:49:06,904
In and out, okay?
We're just knocking on the door.

1041
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:08,113
Just follow my lead.

1042
00:49:08,114 --> 00:49:09,616
This is what I've been
training for.

1043
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:13,911
Okay. 102, Ms. Berman.
She's a kindergarten teacher.

1044
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:15,913
[buzzer rings]

1045
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:16,914
[Ms. Berman] Hello?

1046
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:19,208
Yeah. This is, uh,
Mario's pizza.

1047
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:21,251
What accent is that?

1048
00:49:21,252 --> 00:49:23,712
We got a couple of pies here,
they're for 103,

1049
00:49:23,713 --> 00:49:25,422
that we can't deliver.

1050
00:49:25,423 --> 00:49:26,983
[Ms. Berman] Well that's not
my problem.

1051
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:29,593
Okay. New plan.

1052
00:49:29,594 --> 00:49:30,512
Yeah.

1053
00:49:30,513 --> 00:49:32,221
We wait until someone comes out.

1054
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:35,724
Or we just use the keys.

1055
00:49:35,725 --> 00:49:36,809
Where did you get those?

1056
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,269
They were in the file.

1057
00:49:39,896 --> 00:49:41,189
Come on.

1058
00:49:41,898 --> 00:49:43,149
Rookie.

1059
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:46,152
Oh.

1060
00:49:47,153 --> 00:49:48,613
Charming little spot.

1061
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:53,368
Was it you?

1062
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:55,912
I'm sorry?

1063
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:56,954
Huh?

1064
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:58,872
Was it you who took
my wheelchair?

1065
00:49:58,873 --> 00:50:02,584
'Cause I left it right here and
the next thing I know it's gone.

1066
00:50:02,585 --> 00:50:05,337
We... no, no, no.
We haven't seen it.

1067
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:07,464
Are you alright?
Do you need us to take you...

1068
00:50:07,465 --> 00:50:08,465
[gun cocks]

1069
00:50:09,509 --> 00:50:11,219
I'll be fine.

1070
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:16,265
Well that checks out.

1071
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:17,559
I think she likes you.

1072
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:19,101
It's the mustache.

1073
00:50:19,102 --> 00:50:21,395
Oh... are you jealous?

1074
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:22,396
Maybe.

1075
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:24,481
Yikes.

1076
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:25,482
Okay.

1077
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:28,318
This is it. 101.
This is it, this is it.

1078
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,029
Uh... I'm having
second thoughts.

1079
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,155
I'm just gonna knock.

1080
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:32,698
It literally says don't knock.

1081
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:34,908
It also says leave packages.
I don't plan to do that either.

1082
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:36,160

- Mr. Gasko?
- Alden, let's go.

1092
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,768
Birdie, you need to get in here.

1093
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:01,853

This guy needs a housekeeper.

1097
00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:18,827
We should really get outta here.

1098
00:51:18,828 --> 00:51:20,246
Yeah, we should.

1099
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,292
Oh, my gosh.

1100
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:26,418
What is it?

1101
00:51:26,419 --> 00:51:28,379
Look at all this mustard!

1102
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,047
This guy must be a real
sandwich nut.

1103
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:31,382
Alden, let's go!
Come on.

1104
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:32,863
Will you relax?
It's not like we're...

1105
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:34,968
What?

1106
00:51:34,969 --> 00:51:36,763
Birdie. Check this out.

1107
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:39,473
Alden!

1108
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:41,768
Right.

1109
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:45,271
Yeah. Now might be a good time
to call the FBI.

1110
00:51:45,855 --> 00:51:47,106
Let's call them from the car.

1111
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:48,232
I knew we shouldn't
have come here.

1112
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:49,109
This was a mistake.

1113
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:51,318
Ella, call FBI.

1114
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:53,570

I could get disbarred for this, Alden.

1119
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:14,174
I told you we should've gotten
out of there.

1120
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:16,301
Birdie, we are this close

1121

to blowing this whole thing
wide open.

1122

What planet are you living on?

1123
00:52:20,473 --> 00:52:23,851
In the real world, if the FBI
has you handcuffed

in the back of a car,

1125
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:26,979
that means you have to make
some serious life changes.

1126
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,772
Okay. Here's what
I think we do.

1127

No. You know what?

1128
00:52:30,191 --> 00:52:31,859
I can't partake in your
detective fantasy anymore.

1129
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,652

Of course it does.

But listen up.

You understand?

1143
00:53:06,686 --> 00:53:07,686
You're free to go.

1144
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:09,480
I am not an amateur.

In fact my new theory...

1153
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:25,662
Mr. Case, some free advice.
Stay in your lane.

1154
00:53:25,663 --> 00:53:28,374
Perhaps Reddit would be a more
appropriate arena for you.

1155

Plus...

1156
00:53:29,876 --> 00:53:32,127
I got an unmarked blue sedan
that's been trailing me around,

1157
00:53:32,128 --> 00:53:34,588
which means we are definitely
close to something.

1158

- Wait. You're being trailed?
- Yes.

- By a blue sedan?
- Yes.

- You're sure?
- Yes!

1161
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:42,680
- Well this changes everything.
- It does?

1162
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:43,723
Absolutely...

1163
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:46,350
Not.

to talk to them.

No, no, Alden.
You promised.

to walk away.

From what, Birdie?
From the case or...

1174
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:11,250
or from our marriage?

1175
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:13,794
Maybe... maybe we should
just quit and get divorced.

00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:14,795
Huh Birdie?

1177
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:17,589
You saw the papers.

1178
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,299
I drew those up after
the cryptocurrency thing.

1179
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,884
I was angry. Okay?

1180
00:54:20,885 --> 00:54:23,053
You weren't supposed to see.
How did you get those anyway?

1181
00:54:23,054 --> 00:54:25,097
They looked pretty official
to me.

1182
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:27,266
I might've lied about accounting

1183
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:29,893
but you kept a divorce
secret from me.

1184
00:54:29,894 --> 00:54:32,771
I don't know whether to be
hurt or impressed.

1185
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:34,481
Well, if you saw them
why didn't you say anything?

1186
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:39,319
Because maybe... maybe
saying it out loud made it true.

1187
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,613
So... so what is it?

1188
00:54:41,614 --> 00:54:44,367
Are we... are we...
are we done?

1189
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:47,995
It's like Penelope said,
we're either growing together

1190

or we're growing apart.

1191
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:54,084
And for a while now...
we've been growing apart.

1192

When we got married,

1193
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:58,255
is this what you pictured
our life being like?

1194
00:54:58,256 --> 00:55:02,301
No. Not exactly.

1195
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:04,803
I thought we'd, you know,
have a boat and...

1196
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:06,180
and a kid or two.

1197
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:09,683
But as long as I'm with you,
none of that matters.

1198
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:11,769
What did you think it was
gonna be like?

1199
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,228
Not this.

1200
00:55:13,229 --> 00:55:14,689
I'm not quitting on us.

1201
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:17,775
What are you doing?

1202
00:55:17,776 --> 00:55:19,986

No.

How bad is it?

Oh. No, no, no.

1223
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:17,751
They're ecstatic.

Which Tim's wife was oddly
cool about it.

Simultaneously, Tim was trying
to evict Lean McGuiness

from his hiding spot
of 30 years.

1245
00:57:19,856 --> 00:57:22,358
Which might've caused Lean
to call his old mob connections

1246
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:24,693

who was in possession of a gun.

1249
00:57:33,578 --> 00:57:36,455
Now... could this have been
a neighbor dispute?

1250
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:39,249
Did Lean like to watch
his TV too loud?

1251
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:42,628
We just don't know.

1252
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:47,800
So apparently the Cecil Bay
Apartments completely sold out.

1253
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:52,012
Everyone wants to live where
Lean McGuiness was hiding out.

1254
00:57:52,013 --> 00:57:53,013
Hmm.

1255
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:57,393
Babe.

1256
00:57:57,394 --> 00:57:58,977
That's a big deal.

1257
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:02,314
We connected the dots to
Lean McGuiness' hiding spot.

1258
00:58:02,315 --> 00:58:04,525
A week after the FBI did.

1259
00:58:04,526 --> 00:58:07,277
Well, they got resources.

1260
00:58:07,278 --> 00:58:08,738
[loud crash outside]

1261
00:58:13,493 --> 00:58:15,077
No, no, no.
Let me go first.

1262
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:16,204
Let me go first.

1263
00:58:18,164 --> 00:58:19,165
What was it?

1264
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:22,252
What?

1265
00:58:32,345 --> 00:58:33,887
Wait, Alden.
Be careful, be careful.

1266
00:58:33,888 --> 00:58:35,015
It's just a brick.

1267
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:36,849
Perfect.

1268
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:38,475
A baseball glove?

1269
00:58:38,476 --> 00:58:39,728
I don't know.

1270
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:44,858
Will you just... be careful.
Okay? Don't cut yourself.

1271
00:58:46,526 --> 00:58:47,861
What's it say?

1272
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:53,908
[in unison]
Let sleeping dogs lie.

1273
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:03,876
Okay.

1274
00:59:04,919 --> 00:59:08,756
So... because you are
"hot on the trail"

1275
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:11,633
with something involving
"Lean McGuiness",

1276
00:59:11,634 --> 00:59:13,260
you think that the brick
that went through your window

1277
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:16,555
was somehow "mob related".

1278
00:59:16,556 --> 00:59:19,016
That's correct,
officer air quotes.

1279
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:20,809
It's officer Newton.
It's not officer air quotes.

1280
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:23,395
Sorry, officer "Newton".

1281
00:59:23,396 --> 00:59:24,314
You know what?

1282
00:59:24,315 --> 00:59:26,648
Officer... are we in danger?

1283
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:27,858
You know what?

1284
00:59:27,859 --> 00:59:29,401
It's probably just some kids
playing a prank.

1285
00:59:29,402 --> 00:59:30,819
I'll write a report, let you
know if anything comes up.

1286
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,820
Thank you.

1287
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,866
Should I be concerned
about that?

1288
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:40,412
Oh, that's just
an "art project".

1289
00:59:40,413 --> 00:59:42,289
Don't do things that I do.

1290
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:43,707
Have a nice night.

1291
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:44,751
Not you.

1292
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:49,713
Well, why throw a brick
through the window?

1293
00:59:49,714 --> 00:59:52,091
Why not just leave
a note in the mailbox

1294
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:53,509
or tape it to the front door.

1295
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,135
It's to send a message, Alden.

1296
00:59:55,136 --> 00:59:56,929
Leaving a letter in the mailbox,

1297
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,222
not exactly threatening.

1298
00:59:58,223 --> 01:00:00,349
Mmhmm. Well it'd be
the decent thing to do.

1299
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,975
You know what I think
the decent thing to do is?

1300
01:00:01,976 --> 01:00:04,520
I think the decent thing to do
is just to take a step back

1301
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:07,356
and let things cool down a bit.

1302
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:09,358
I can't do that.

1303
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,485
Alden... whoever threw
that brick

1304
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:13,362
knows where we live.

1305
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:15,115
What if next time
they don't stay outside?

1306
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,912
Waiter.

1307
01:00:21,913 --> 01:00:23,205
Watchmaker's apprentice.

1308
01:00:23,206 --> 01:00:24,206
Cheesemonger.

1309
01:00:24,207 --> 01:00:25,457
Notary.

1310
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:27,876
T-shirt screen printer.

1311
01:00:27,877 --> 01:00:28,877
Museum docent.

1312
01:00:28,878 --> 01:00:29,878
Barista.

1313
01:00:29,879 --> 01:00:31,255
Crypto currency miner.

1314
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:32,840
What are you getting at?

1315
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:35,592
These are all the careers
that I have started and quit.

1316
01:00:35,593 --> 01:00:37,678
And some of them were too easy,
some of them were too hard,

1317
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:39,555
some of them were
just terrible ideas.

1318
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:41,849
Yeah, but all those things
make you you.

1319
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:45,477
I don't wanna be known as the
guy who quits things anymore.

1320
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:49,815
This case, I have to solve it.

1321
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:52,317
And that brick...

1322
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:54,778
that means we're making somebody
very nervous.

1323
01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:58,157
Yeah. And I'm a little scared.

1324
01:00:58,158 --> 01:00:59,451
Me too.

1325
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:02,077
And I don't know exactly

1326
01:01:02,078 --> 01:01:06,165
how this whole thing's
gonna play out.

1327
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:08,168
Kinda like me and you.

1328
01:01:11,087 --> 01:01:12,172
But I'm not quitting.

1329
01:01:13,673 --> 01:01:16,718
Because I know in my heart
they're both worth fighting for.

1330
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:34,110
[mysterious music]

1331
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:44,537
Wow.

1332
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:49,876
It was Kyle all along.

1333
01:01:51,002 --> 01:01:53,921
Ado Construction is the company
that was developing the site

1334
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:55,756
where Lean McGuiness was found.

1335
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:58,926
It's on Kyle's shirt
in this picture

1336
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:02,596
because the owner of the company
is Kyle's uncle!

1337
01:02:02,597 --> 01:02:04,139
How much coffee have you had?

1338
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,934
Birdie, this is the connection
that we've been looking for.

1339
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:10,896
I think Kyle killed
Lean McGuiness and then Tim.

1340
01:02:10,897 --> 01:02:12,606
What? No. I...

1341
01:02:12,607 --> 01:02:15,234
I really don't see Kyle
being capable of one murder,

1342
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:16,360
let alone two.

1343
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:17,986
Do you have any proof?

1344
01:02:17,987 --> 01:02:19,238
Not yet.

1345
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:20,739
I'm working late.
I have to get my steps in.

1346
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:22,199
I think it's called running.

1347
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,826
No. It's called getting
your steps in when the office

1348
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:26,078
has a competition of who
can get the most steps in.

1349
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,247
And Kyle is killing it.

1350
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:29,124
See what I did there?

1351
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:30,499
That was pretty good.

1352
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,711
Look... do your thing
but just please be careful.

1353
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:34,712
Okay.

if you're looking for her.

Uh, actually,
I'm looking for you.

1362
01:03:07,245 --> 01:03:08,704
Oh.

1363
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:10,664
You know how when Tim died
you said to let you know

1364
01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:12,541
if there was anything
you could do to help?

1365
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:15,210
Well, I need your help.

1366
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:17,963
Um... you know how everybody's
been tracking their steps

1367
01:03:17,964 --> 01:03:20,591
for that infernal
wellness challenge?

1368
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:23,552
I have almost hit
my goal this week.

1369
01:03:23,553 --> 01:03:25,387
Good for you!

1370
01:03:25,388 --> 01:03:31,060
Do you have, uh, login info for
the company tracking profile?

1371
01:03:31,061 --> 01:03:32,728
I do.

1372
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:36,732
And you could pull all the GPS
data for the last... two weeks?

1373
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:40,569
I've got some work to do now
but I could do it later.

1374
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:42,279
Should I just give it to Birdie?

1375
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,989
Oh. No, no, no.
Birdie's slammed.

1376
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:45,240
She's probably gonna
be here all night.

1377
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:48,077
Um... I could come back
in a couple of hours.

1378
01:03:48,078 --> 01:03:49,578
You know what?

1379
01:03:49,579 --> 01:03:51,747
I have errands to do
in your neighborhood.

1380
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:53,582
Why don't I just pop
it by tonight?

1381
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:54,875
That sounds perfect.

1382
01:03:54,876 --> 01:03:56,377
- Great.
- I'll see you then.

1383
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:58,003
- Okay.
- Okay.

Ah... no.
I mean, yes.

But no.
I just realized something.

1408
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:20,544
Anyway, thanks for coming.
Did you bring the step data?

1409
01:05:20,545 --> 01:05:24,840
I sure did. Why do you want it?

a way to prove

1411

there was foul play
in Tim's death.

01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:11,262
You sure?

1425
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:12,429
Yup. Yup.

1426
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:13,555
Okay, if you say so.

1427
01:06:13,556 --> 01:06:15,057
[chuckles]

1428
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:16,100
Phew.

1429
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:17,893
How many steps you get in today?

1430
01:06:17,894 --> 01:06:20,813
Uh... 5,000, and that's
with a morning run.

1431
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:22,189
How about you?

1432
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:23,524
Uh... let's see.

1433
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:28,237
[clears throat]
22,477.

1434
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:30,572
How is that possible?

1435
01:06:30,573 --> 01:06:32,366
I'll show you. Okay?

1436
01:06:32,367 --> 01:06:33,785
Check this out.

1437
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:39,248
Okay. So you can manually enter
your steps on their back end.

1438
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:40,166
Wait. Are you serious?

1439
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:41,709
Yeah. Yeah.

1440
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:43,794
I read their terms of service,
it's actually kind of scary.

1441
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:46,422
They store the GPS history
of every user.

1442
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:48,841
Like, you wanna see where
everyone is right now?

1443
01:06:48,842 --> 01:06:50,592
That's a complete invasion
of privacy.

1444
01:06:50,593 --> 01:06:51,969
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

1445
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:53,470
But I guess since
you're already logged in...

1446
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:55,723
we can sneak a peek. Right?

1447
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:56,975
Yeah.

1448
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,940
The trick is, the step counter
tracks data using GPS.

1449
01:07:04,941 --> 01:07:07,651
Which means I should be able
to prove unequivocally

1450
01:07:07,652 --> 01:07:09,445
that Tim was actually murdered.

1451
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:11,405
Wow. Alden!

1452
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:12,323
[glasses clink]

1453
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:13,574
You are quite the sleuth.

1454
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:14,700
[chuckles] Well...

1455
01:07:14,701 --> 01:07:16,744
Have you told
anyone else about this?

1456
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:18,203
No. No, you're the first.

1457
01:07:18,204 --> 01:07:21,123
Mmm. That's good.

1458
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:23,709
I really wish you had let
sleeping dogs lie.

1459
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,794
Hey, that's what the brick said.

1460
01:07:25,795 --> 01:07:27,547
[taser zaps]

1461
01:07:29,466 --> 01:07:30,466
Paula?

1462
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,968
[thud]

1463
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:48,943
[grunting]

1464
01:07:51,863 --> 01:07:53,072
Paula?

1465
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:55,741
This is very impressive.

1466
01:07:55,742 --> 01:07:57,743
I just wish someone
had spent this much time

1467
01:07:57,744 --> 01:08:00,329
trying to find justice
for my sister, Caroline.

1468
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:03,332
Justice? Why, what happened?

1469
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:06,960
What happened?

1470
01:08:06,961 --> 01:08:08,379
[chuckles]

1471
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,506
You are a funny little monkey,
aren't you, Alden?

1472
01:08:10,507 --> 01:08:13,592
Look, Paula. Whatever happened
to your sister Caroline,

1473
01:08:13,593 --> 01:08:15,219
I would've helped, I swear.

1474
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:16,887
No you wouldn't have!

1475
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:19,640
You would've been too scared of
Lean McGuiness and his thugs.

1476
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:22,601
You would've kept your mouth
shut just like everyone else.

1477
01:08:22,602 --> 01:08:24,770
Everyone knew who killed her

1478
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:27,106
but they didn't do anything
about it.

1479
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:29,692
She deserves justice.

1480
01:08:29,693 --> 01:08:30,693
Huh?

1481
01:08:32,696 --> 01:08:35,698
You've been on my tail
this whole time.

1482
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:36,699
I have?

1483
01:08:39,035 --> 01:08:42,746
Oh... I have.

1484
01:08:42,747 --> 01:08:46,291
Because Kyle didn't kill
Lean McGuiness.

1485
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:48,377
You did.

1486
01:08:48,378 --> 01:08:50,588
And the GPS
would've proven that.

1487
01:08:54,384 --> 01:08:55,218
So, look at this.

1488
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:56,260
Okay? So that's you and me.

1489
01:08:56,261 --> 01:08:57,553
Okay.

1490
01:08:57,554 --> 01:08:59,471
Uh... that's your mom.

1491
01:08:59,472 --> 01:09:02,266
And... Paula is...

1492
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:03,600
At my house.
That's weird.

1493
01:09:03,601 --> 01:09:05,060
Yeah.

1494
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:07,688
Wait. You said they store
people's GPS history, right?

1495
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:09,106
Mmhmm.

1496
01:09:09,107 --> 01:09:11,817
So can you see where everyone
was the night Tim died?

1497
01:09:11,818 --> 01:09:13,695
Yeah. Yeah, I can.

1498
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:18,991
Wow. I... I can't believe I
never thought of this before.

1499
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:20,035
Let's see here.

1500
01:09:22,954 --> 01:09:24,456
That's me finding Tim.

1501
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,125
[ominous music]

1502
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:29,502
Wait a second.

1503
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:34,256
Paula was there too.

1504
01:09:34,257 --> 01:09:37,217
And she's leaving through
the back door.

1505
01:09:37,218 --> 01:09:38,470
Does that mean...

1506
01:09:39,554 --> 01:09:42,056
Paula killed Tim?

1507
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:43,557
Yeah.

1508
01:09:43,558 --> 01:09:44,976
I think it does.

1509
01:09:46,811 --> 01:09:47,812
Alden.

1510
01:09:48,897 --> 01:09:50,732
Oh my gosh! Alden!

1511
01:09:54,235 --> 01:09:56,738
[phone chiming]

1512
01:09:59,657 --> 01:10:03,619
That's my mom, don't answer.
She is a talker.

1513
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:06,831
Oh. Let's let that go
to voicemail.

1514
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,460
[voicemail] This is Alden.

1515
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:12,961
I can't come to
the phone right now.

1516
01:10:12,962 --> 01:10:14,046
Leave a message.

1517
01:10:14,047 --> 01:10:16,715
Alden! Alden! It was Paula
all along.

1518
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:17,800
Call me.

1519
01:10:17,801 --> 01:10:19,385
Now...

1520
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:20,969
What to do with you?

1521
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:22,805
Look, what do you say
you cut me loose,

1522
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:24,515
we mosey on down
to the Side Saddle,

1523
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:26,725
we go halfsies on a basket
of jalapeño poppers

1524
01:10:26,726 --> 01:10:29,353
and we just put this whole
thing behind us. Huh?

1525
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:30,979
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

1526
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,314
It is!

1527
01:10:32,315 --> 01:10:37,236
That monster killed my sweet
sister 33 years ago.

1528
01:10:37,237 --> 01:10:39,238
She was just walking
home one day,

1529
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:40,572
took a shortcut down an alley

1530
01:10:40,573 --> 01:10:43,033
and saw something
she shouldn't have.

1531
01:10:43,034 --> 01:10:44,952
And she was gone.

1532
01:10:44,953 --> 01:10:47,371
They found her body
two weeks later.

1533
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:50,499
Two weeks later!

1534
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,792
I'm really sorry
about your sister

1535
01:10:51,793 --> 01:10:53,168
but you don't have to hurt me.

1536
01:10:53,169 --> 01:10:54,336
I didn't do anything.

1537
01:10:54,337 --> 01:10:55,671
But you did!

1538
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:57,965
You got in the way!

1539
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:00,135
I did everyone a favor
by killing Lean.

1540
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:06,223
And now... I have to do
something with you.

1541
01:11:06,224 --> 01:11:07,934
No you don't.
No you don't!

1542
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,938
Does Birdie have any bleach?

1543
01:11:13,898 --> 01:11:14,941
Bleach?

1544
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:16,484
What's this?

1545
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:17,777
No, no, no.

1546
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:20,947
Really? Now you're fixing
the street?

1547
01:11:22,907 --> 01:11:23,907
[tires screech]

1548
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:28,245
This is not happening, this is
not happening. Okay. Just...

1549
01:11:28,246 --> 01:11:29,413
Hey!

1550
01:11:29,414 --> 01:11:30,539
Hang in there, baby.
Birdie's coming.

1551
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:32,334
[tires squeal]

1552
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:37,296
Now that I think about it,
we don't have any bleach.

1553
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:40,049
We only use Earth friendly
non-toxic cleaning products

1554
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:41,091
in this house.

1555
01:11:41,092 --> 01:11:42,217
We're on sort of a...
a new green...

1556
01:11:42,218 --> 01:11:43,802
[Paula] Never mind.

1557
01:11:43,803 --> 01:11:47,389
I found drain cleaner, floor
polish and some laundry pods.

1558
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:50,351
Uh... you know me,
Mr. Curious.

1559
01:11:50,352 --> 01:11:52,145
Why did you have
to kill Tim too?

1560
01:11:52,687 --> 01:11:55,272
[Paula] I went to the office
to scare Tim

1561
01:11:55,273 --> 01:11:57,941
but he was gonna turn me in.

1562
01:11:57,942 --> 01:12:01,945
So Tim had to be put out
to pasture

1563
01:12:01,946 --> 01:12:05,949
because he figured things out
and wouldn't let it just be.

1564
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:09,912
You all assumed that Tim went
to the apartments by himself.

1565
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:10,789
Ha!

1566
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:12,414
I'm always with Tim.

1567
01:12:12,415 --> 01:12:14,500
But nobody ever sees Paula.

1568
01:12:14,501 --> 01:12:18,087
I was with Tim,
like I always was,

1569
01:12:18,088 --> 01:12:22,383
when he went door to door
at the Cecil Bay Apartments.

1570
01:12:22,384 --> 01:12:25,719
And when we went
to apartment 101

1571
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:28,305
and Mr. Frederick Gasko
came to the door,

1572
01:12:28,306 --> 01:12:30,933
I knew instantly who he was.

1573
01:12:30,934 --> 01:12:34,186
This old block of wood
doesn't forget a face.

1574
01:12:34,187 --> 01:12:35,437
So I went back.

1575
01:12:35,438 --> 01:12:36,480
[chuckles]

1576
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:37,773
[taser zaps]
[Gasko yells]

1577
01:12:37,774 --> 01:12:40,651
To Mr. Gasko with
my trusty zapper

1578
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:42,945
and I gave him a send-off
that he deserved.

1579
01:12:42,946 --> 01:12:44,238
[chuckles]

1580
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,657
I would've said shock
of his life, but...

1581
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:47,783
no time for humor.

1582
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:49,451
What are you gonna do with that?

1583
01:12:49,452 --> 01:12:50,494
What are you doing?

1584
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:51,495
No, no, no.
No, no.

1585
01:12:51,496 --> 01:12:52,705
No. No.

1586
01:12:52,706 --> 01:12:53,747
Take a sip.
You'll go right to sleep.

1587
01:12:53,748 --> 01:12:55,290
Nuh uh.
Oh, that smells terrible.

1588
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:58,336
You know, we could do this
the easy way or the hard way.

1589
01:12:59,337 --> 01:13:00,379
Look at me.

1590
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,339
Look around you.

1591
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:04,925
I'm a 38-year-old private
investigator in training.

1592
01:13:04,926 --> 01:13:07,136
I don't do anything
the easy way.

1593
01:13:07,137 --> 01:13:08,430
Have it your way.

1594
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:11,016
What does that mean?

1595
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:13,184
Paula, what does that mean?!

1596
01:13:14,936 --> 01:13:17,396
Uh... So... so... so,
you drove to Rhode Island

1597
01:13:17,397 --> 01:13:18,647
with Lean's body in your car

1598
01:13:18,648 --> 01:13:19,815
and you dumped it at
the construction site

1599
01:13:19,816 --> 01:13:21,483
to make it look like a mob hit.

1600
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:23,694
But why was Kyle wearing
the T-shirt?

1601
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:25,529
[Paula] Kyle's uncle owns
Ado Construction.

1602
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:27,197
Yeah.

1603
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:28,449
[Paula] You'd be hard-pressed
to find a construction site

1604
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:30,367
in Rhode Island that wasn't done
by them.

1605
01:13:30,368 --> 01:13:31,618
It was a happy accident.

1606
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:34,538
Oh... Uh huh.

1607
01:13:34,539 --> 01:13:38,125
And, uh... how did Tim
figure it out?

1608
01:13:38,126 --> 01:13:41,003
[Paula] Tim knew my sister
was killed by Lean McGuiness

1609
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:44,006
and when they found his body
he put two and two together.

1610
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:46,925
We were the only people
who knew Lean's hiding place.

1611
01:13:46,926 --> 01:13:49,178
Help me out here.
Any ideas?

1612
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:50,221
What?

1613
01:13:51,514 --> 01:13:52,848
Man, you're good.

1614
01:13:52,849 --> 01:13:55,434
[Paula] Tim was gonna go
to the FBI about me,

1615
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:58,772
and they would've found me,
so he had to be silenced.

1616
01:13:59,689 --> 01:14:01,066
[grunting]

1617
01:14:03,193 --> 01:14:04,444
[robot whirs]

1618
01:14:06,196 --> 01:14:07,197
No.

1619
01:14:08,281 --> 01:14:10,032
Yes!

1620
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:11,450
[chuckles]

1621
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:12,451
[garage door creaks open]

1622
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:13,452
Help me! Help!

1623
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:14,620
Help!

1624
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:15,704
No one is coming
to save you, Alden.

1625
01:14:15,705 --> 01:14:16,664
No, no, no, no, no.

1626
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:17,749
Help!

1627
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:21,543
No, no, no. Paula. Paula.

1628
01:14:21,544 --> 01:14:24,672
[stuttering]
P... P... P...

1629
01:14:24,673 --> 01:14:25,839
What about Birdie?

1630
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,882
Think about...
think about Birdie.

1631
01:14:26,883 --> 01:14:28,425
Sweet little...
sweet little Birdie.

1632
01:14:28,426 --> 01:14:29,677
I know, poor Birdie.

1633
01:14:29,678 --> 01:14:31,220
Right?

1634
01:14:31,221 --> 01:14:33,889
Don't worry, I am gonna be there
to help her through this.

1635
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:35,140
That's not really
what I had in mind.

1636
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:36,350
And now...

1637
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:39,478
it's time for heaven
to get another angel.

1638
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:40,397
Nuh uh.

1639
01:14:40,398 --> 01:14:41,398
- Open up.
- Mm.

1640
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:43,148
- Mm.
- Open up! Open!

1641
01:14:43,149 --> 01:14:44,775
- Open up.
- Mm.

1642
01:14:44,776 --> 01:14:45,860
- Open up!
- Mm.

1643
01:14:48,905 --> 01:14:49,572
Mm. Mm. Mm...

1644
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:51,949
- Open up, Alden!
- Mm.

1645
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:52,950
[Rick] Alden?

1646
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:54,868
In here!

1647
01:14:54,869 --> 01:14:55,869
Freeze!

1648
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:56,995
Who are you?

1649
01:14:56,996 --> 01:14:58,205
That's Rick.

1650
01:14:58,206 --> 01:15:00,083
Drop the... turkey baster.

1651
01:15:02,544 --> 01:15:03,294
[garage door creaks open]

1652
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,712
Get her! Get her! Get her!

1653
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:05,380
- [taser zaps]
- [groaning]

1654
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:06,589
[Alden] Get her!

1655
01:15:07,132 --> 01:15:08,049
Natbot!

1656
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:10,050
[robot whirs]

1657
01:15:10,051 --> 01:15:10,969
[Alden] Get her, Rick!

1658
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:12,302
[Rick] Got you.

1659
01:15:12,303 --> 01:15:13,221
[Alden] Get her!

1660
01:15:13,221 --> 01:15:14,180
[Paula] Let me go!

1661
01:15:14,181 --> 01:15:15,848
[Rick] Come on, get up.

1662
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:16,974
- Get her, Rick.
- Get off of me!

1663
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:18,434
[Alden] Show her who's boss.
Get her!

1664
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:20,477
There you go.
You got her.

1665
01:15:20,478 --> 01:15:22,689
[laughing]
We did it!

1666
01:15:23,773 --> 01:15:26,275
I knew it was you in the blue
sedan the whole time.

1667
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:27,401
Alden!
[knocking on door]

1668
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:29,319
Alden! Are you okay?

1669
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,405
Birdie! Natbot.

1670
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:32,406
[garage door creaks open]

1671
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:33,407
- Alden?
- Birdie!

1672
01:15:33,408 --> 01:15:34,408
Alden?

1673
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:36,994
Alden?

1674
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:38,079
Hi honey.

1675
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,164
[sirens wail]

1676
01:15:40,165 --> 01:15:42,082
Tonight, a bizarre ending
to the mystery

1677
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:44,752
surrounding the fate
of Lean McGuiness.

1678
01:15:44,753 --> 01:15:46,503
We're hearing that
Paula Saint Gervais,

1679
01:15:46,504 --> 01:15:48,464
who's sister,
Caroline Saint Gervais,

1680
01:15:48,465 --> 01:15:51,008
was killed by Lean McGuiness
in 1987...

1681
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:53,802
Well, I told them all about
the GPS.

1682
01:15:53,803 --> 01:15:55,262
That should seal things up.

1683
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,764
Thanks, man.

1684
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:59,850
Hey, I'm really glad it was me
you chose to follow.

1685
01:15:59,851 --> 01:16:02,561
Well, yeah.
You did good, glasses.

1686
01:16:02,562 --> 01:16:03,812
[chuckles]

1687
01:16:03,813 --> 01:16:05,272
Looks like you finally got
your feet wet.

1688
01:16:05,273 --> 01:16:06,775
Thanks Detective.

1689
01:16:07,942 --> 01:16:09,027
- Don't.
- Yeah, it's...

1690
01:16:09,402 --> 01:16:11,029
Yeah. Yeah.

1691
01:16:12,572 --> 01:16:13,781
Did you just make a new friend?

1692
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:15,158
I don't know if I'd go that far.

1693
01:16:16,493 --> 01:16:17,785
Before they take her away,

1694
01:16:17,786 --> 01:16:19,370
there's something
that's been bothering me.

1695
01:16:19,371 --> 01:16:20,371
Wait. What do you mean?

1696
01:16:20,372 --> 01:16:22,498
Officer! Wait, one sec.

1697
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:24,958
I need to Columbo her.

1698
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,127
Hey Paula, how did
you get Lean's body

1699
01:16:27,128 --> 01:16:28,837
into the car that night?

1700
01:16:28,838 --> 01:16:30,382
I didn't have a plan for that.

1701
01:16:32,258 --> 01:16:33,676
[Paula] When I got to
the apartment building

1702
01:16:33,677 --> 01:16:36,011
there was a wheelchair
sitting there.

1703
01:16:36,012 --> 01:16:39,973
Of course! Mrs. Carmopolis'
wheelchair.

1704
01:16:39,974 --> 01:16:41,350
Yes!

1705
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:46,356
Well, I think we're done here.
Take 'er away, boys.

1706
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:50,526
I've always wanted to do that.

1707
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:52,278
You were made for this.

1708
01:16:57,367 --> 01:16:59,368
[sighs]

1709
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:00,536
I'm so happy to see you.

1710
01:17:00,537 --> 01:17:02,287
I know.

1711
01:17:02,288 --> 01:17:04,540
Authorities aren't releasing
any more details at this time.

1712
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:07,876
But my sources tell me
the case was solved

1713
01:17:07,877 --> 01:17:12,090
by a local husband and wife
private investigation team.

1714
01:17:13,299 --> 01:17:16,552
So... how does it feel?

1715
01:17:16,553 --> 01:17:18,095
Ah, it's a little sore.

1716
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:21,015
No. How does it feel
to solve the case?

1717
01:17:21,016 --> 01:17:22,182
Oh... [chuckles]

1718
01:17:22,183 --> 01:17:24,852
I... I can't believe
we solved it.

1719
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:26,730
- We did it!
- I know.

1720
01:17:28,606 --> 01:17:29,648
[both slurping]

1721
01:17:29,649 --> 01:17:31,483
Mmm.

1722
01:17:31,484 --> 01:17:32,402
That hits the spot.

1723
01:17:32,403 --> 01:17:33,527
- It's pretty good.
- Mmhmm.

1724
01:17:33,528 --> 01:17:34,863
So tell me...

1725
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:37,448
When we got married,

1726
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:40,159
is this what you imagined
your life would be like?

1727
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,327
Oh, not at all.

1728
01:17:42,328 --> 01:17:43,704
This?

1729
01:17:43,705 --> 01:17:45,205
Way better.

1730
01:17:45,206 --> 01:17:46,540
Hmm.

1731
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:48,251
'Cause I get to do it with you.

1732
01:17:55,759 --> 01:17:57,384
What's this?

1733
01:17:57,385 --> 01:17:59,512
It was our divorce papers.

1734
01:18:01,097 --> 01:18:02,349
[chuckles]

1735
01:18:09,731 --> 01:18:12,649
[laughing]

1736
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:14,778
- No more secrets.
- No more secrets.

1737
01:18:31,795 --> 01:18:33,587
I love you, baby bird.

1738
01:18:33,588 --> 01:18:35,298
I love you, big bird.

1739
01:18:42,138 --> 01:18:43,347
Babe. Come on.

1740
01:18:43,348 --> 01:18:44,682
We can't be late for my mom.

1741
01:18:44,683 --> 01:18:46,016
Well, the door's not
gonna lock itself.

1742
01:18:46,017 --> 01:18:47,768
I know, but you know how
punctual she is.

1743
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:48,977
Okay? I just...

1744
01:18:48,978 --> 01:18:50,229
I know. I mean,
safety first.

1745
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:51,481
Are you the Case's?

1746
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:55,317
Who... who's asking?

1747
01:18:55,318 --> 01:18:57,111
I'm Johnny D'Rossi.

1748
01:18:57,112 --> 01:19:00,447
My family owns the wine
and cheese store on Fifth.

1749
01:19:00,448 --> 01:19:01,740
Mmhmm.

1750
01:19:01,741 --> 01:19:03,450
Oh. You guys have
great pickles.

1751
01:19:03,451 --> 01:19:04,494
Thank you.

1752
01:19:07,372 --> 01:19:09,332
This is for you.

1753
01:19:12,293 --> 01:19:13,335
It's a ham.

1754
01:19:13,336 --> 01:19:14,420
[sighs]

1755
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:15,713
Oh.

1756
01:19:15,714 --> 01:19:16,923
Bone in.

1757
01:19:18,258 --> 01:19:21,301
I spent a lot of years
with Lean McGuiness.

1758
01:19:21,302 --> 01:19:22,303
Too many.

1759
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:26,098
But his murder had a lot of
people worked up

1760
01:19:26,099 --> 01:19:30,394
and what you did
prevented more bloodshed.

1761
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:35,232
You ever need a favor,
you come by the store.

1762
01:19:35,233 --> 01:19:37,985
Your husband, he did
a great service.

1763
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:41,196
Actually, uh...
we're partners.

1764
01:19:41,197 --> 01:19:43,449
Hmm? Oh...

1765
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:45,367
Well then, you're lucky you
two have found each other.

1766
01:19:45,368 --> 01:19:47,369
Yeah. We are.

1767
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:48,370
[chuckles]

1768
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:56,420
So... was that really Johnny
"Palm Trees" D'Rossi?

1769
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:57,755
Yup.

1770
01:19:57,756 --> 01:19:59,840
[Birdie] Of the D'Rossi
crime family?

1771
01:19:59,841 --> 01:20:01,425
[Alden] Mmhmm.

1772
01:20:01,426 --> 01:20:04,137
And the giver of fine hams.

1773
01:20:08,224 --> 01:20:09,391
Oh, this ham's really heavy.

1774
01:20:09,392 --> 01:20:10,185
Hi.

1775
01:20:10,186 --> 01:20:11,643
Birdie. Alden.

1776
01:20:11,644 --> 01:20:15,022
Mrs. Grant reached out and
wanted to speak to you both.

1777
01:20:15,023 --> 01:20:16,648
What are you holding?

1778
01:20:16,649 --> 01:20:17,609
Mobster ham!

1779
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:19,069
[thuds]

1780
01:20:19,778 --> 01:20:22,613
Oh, Mrs. Grant.
It's nice to see you again.

1781
01:20:22,614 --> 01:20:26,408
I wanted to formally express
my gratitude to you both.

1782
01:20:26,409 --> 01:20:30,245
Tim has considered this firm to
be part of his extended family

1783
01:20:30,246 --> 01:20:34,208
and I am so grateful for your
diligent work to find the truth.

1784
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:36,669
Well, it's the least
we could do for Tim.

1785
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:41,215
Because Tim's death has been
reclassified as a homicide,

1786
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,842
his life insurance policy
is no longer void.

1787
01:20:43,843 --> 01:20:46,638
And I think that Timmy
would want you...

1788
01:20:48,431 --> 01:20:49,933
to have this.

1789
01:20:54,896 --> 01:20:56,355
A million dollars?

1790
01:20:56,356 --> 01:20:57,523
It's a $100,000.

1791
01:20:57,524 --> 01:20:58,941
$100,000?!

1792
01:20:58,942 --> 01:21:00,275
[laughing]

1793
01:21:00,276 --> 01:21:03,570
This is... I... I don't even...

1794
01:21:03,571 --> 01:21:05,155
Thank you.

1795
01:21:05,156 --> 01:21:07,616
Maybe that will help you get
your investigation business

1796
01:21:07,617 --> 01:21:09,368
off the ground.

1797
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:12,746
That is so generous.
Thank you very much.

1798
01:21:12,747 --> 01:21:13,956
And I'll be in charge
of the accounting.

1799
01:21:13,957 --> 01:21:15,208
Absolutely.

1800
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:17,459
Detective.

1801
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,752
[laughing]

1802
01:21:18,753 --> 01:21:20,213
Good work you two.

1803
01:21:20,797 --> 01:21:23,465
You know, Penelope was right.

1804
01:21:23,466 --> 01:21:24,800
You keep this going,

1805
01:21:24,801 --> 01:21:26,969
I might have a few clients
to send your way myself.

1806
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:31,849
Eleonore? Is that actual
approval I'm hearing?

1807
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:33,309
Something like that.

1808
01:21:34,686 --> 01:21:36,103
Hmm.

1809
01:21:36,104 --> 01:21:37,688
So I'll see you tonight?

1810
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:38,648
Tonight.

1811
01:21:38,648 --> 01:21:39,648
Mmm.

1812
01:21:41,776 --> 01:21:43,319
Can't wait.

1813
01:21:46,489 --> 01:21:48,491
Birdie. One second.

1814
01:21:49,701 --> 01:21:53,954
Penelope was very impressed
with what you and Alden did.

1815
01:21:53,955 --> 01:21:56,498
You two seem... better.

1816
01:21:56,499 --> 01:21:57,667
We are.

1817
01:22:00,003 --> 01:22:03,255
Hey, Mom. I mean... Eleonore.

1818
01:22:03,256 --> 01:22:05,549
I'm sorry that I was so
distracted around here.

1819
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:06,967
No.

1820
01:22:06,968 --> 01:22:09,136
I'm the one that should
be apologizing.

1821
01:22:09,137 --> 01:22:11,555
I can admit that I pushed
you too hard,

1822
01:22:11,556 --> 01:22:14,476
and what I don't wanna do
is push you away.

1823
01:22:16,853 --> 01:22:18,979
I think this is where we hug.

1824
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,732
Not in the office, dear.

1825
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,616
Missing persons investigations.

1826
01:22:30,617 --> 01:22:31,617
Who...

1827
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:32,659
[knocks on door]

1828
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,287
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1829
01:22:34,746 --> 01:22:35,871
[Thumbs] Oh, hi. Come on in.

1830
01:22:35,872 --> 01:22:37,164
Thanks.

1831
01:22:37,165 --> 01:22:41,251
[Thumbs] Mrs. Case,
glad you could make it.

1832
01:22:41,252 --> 01:22:42,212
Hi.

1833
01:22:42,213 --> 01:22:43,837
- [Thumbs] Okay...
- Thank you.

1834
01:22:43,838 --> 01:22:46,674
Missing persons investigations.

1835
01:22:46,675 --> 01:22:50,428
Who knows where to start
with something like this?

1836
01:22:56,851 --> 01:22:59,019
[Alden] I mean, everyone is
saying that Rick is the hero,

1837
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:00,938
but when you think about it,

1838
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:02,981
he was just sitting in his car
the whole time.

1839
01:23:02,982 --> 01:23:05,526
Well, I mean, he did kinda...
you know...

1840
01:23:05,527 --> 01:23:07,236
save your life.

1841
01:23:07,237 --> 01:23:08,321
Well...

1842
01:23:11,991 --> 01:23:13,742
[Birdie] Are you
expecting somebody?

1843
01:23:13,743 --> 01:23:15,120
No.

1844
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:18,580
Hello?

1845
01:23:18,581 --> 01:23:20,207
Mr. And Mrs. Case.

1846
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:23,460
I got your name
from Penelope Grant.

1847
01:23:23,461 --> 01:23:24,461
I need your help.

1848
01:23:24,462 --> 01:23:26,840
- Of course. Come on in.
- Thanks.

1849
01:23:31,761 --> 01:23:34,888
[Birdie] So... how can we help?

1850
01:23:34,889 --> 01:23:36,489
[Woman] I don't even know
where to start.
