1
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,170
TRY AS THEY WILL,
AND TRY AS THEY MIGHT,

2
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:55,800
AND TRY AS THEY MIGHT,
WHO STEALS ME GOLD WON'T LIVE
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

3
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,500
A LIMOUSINE!

4
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,130
WHAT IN THE WORLD
HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU,
MR. O'GRADY?

5
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,420
JUST THE START.
JUST THE START,
MY DEAR.

6
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,680
TAKE THE LAST LOOK
AT THIS DUMP.

7
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,680
TOMORROW, WE'LL BE
LOOKING AT MANSIONS.

8
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,600
MANSIONS?
WILL YOU LISTEN TO YOURSELF?
AND A LIMOUSINE!

9
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,230
WE'VE GOT NO MONEY
FOR THIS!

10
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,860
RIGHT INSIDE.

11
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,860
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.
DID THE FUNERAL PARLOR
DELIVER THE PACKAGE?

12
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,080
AYE.
'TIS ON THE PORCH
WHERE THEY LEFT IT.

13
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,500
WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE, DANIEL O'GRADY?

14
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,420
WILL THAT
BE ALL, SIR?

15
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,590
AH. JONES.

16
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,130
BON VOYAGE.

17
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,050
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR.
YOU HAVE A NICE EVENING.

18
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,770
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
IS WE'RE RICH.

19
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,400
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BURY YOUR MOTHER.

20
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,190
NOT SEND HER ASHES ALL
THE WAY FROM IRELAND.

21
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,240
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

22
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,830
IT'S NOT ME MOTHER'S ASHES.

23
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,420
GOLD, LEAH! GOLD!

24
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,380
WHAT IN THE
LORD'S NAME...

25
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,590
A POT OF GOLD!
A WEE PERSON,
A LEPRECHAUN!

26
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,180
I CAUGHT HIM...
AND MADE HIM SHOW ME
WHERE HIS GOLD IS!

27
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,680
IT'S THE RULE, YOU KNOW.

28
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,980
AH, YOU'RE
A DRUNKEN FOOL
AND A STORYTELLER.

29
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,230
- IT'S THE TRUTH I'M TELLIN'!
- THERE'S A STORM BREWING.

30
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,570
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH!

31
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,200
COME ON TO BED, NOW,
AND I'LL MAKE YOU
A POT OF NICE HOT TEA.

32
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,030
LEPRECHAUNS, INDEED.

33
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,990
POT OF GOLD!
WHATEVER NEXT?

34
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,770
DAN? DAN, IS THAT YOU?

35
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,390
I CAN'T BREATHE.
PLEASE OPEN THE SUITCASE.

36
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,510
I'M GOING TO SUFFOCATE.

37
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,230
LIKE THE GOLD BUCKLES
ON ME SHOES?

38
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,740
I WANT ME GOLD...NOW!

39
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,030
OH, GOD, NO!

40
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,430
NO PROBLEM.

41
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,190
I SMELL
SOME TEA BREWING.

42
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,410
I HID THE GOLD, LEAH.
WE'RE RICH NOW.

43
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,620
WHERE DID YOU
HIDE IT, DAN?

44
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,040
DID YOU HIDE IT SOMEWHERE
NEAR THE HOUSE?

45
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,670
TELL ME WHERE
YOU HID THE GOLD

46
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,050
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

47
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,340
THE WEE PEOPLE HAVE
THEIR MAGICAL WAYS.

48
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,180
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH MY WIFE?

49
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,730
OH, THE POOR LASS.
I SHOULD'VE TOLD HER
TO WATCH HER STEP.

50
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,570
I'LL GET YA!
IT'S MY GOLD!

51
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,110
I'LL FIX HIM!
I'LL GET HIM!

52
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,290
YOUR WIFE MAKES
A FINE POT OF TEA,

53
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,960
- WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
- I'LL FIX YOU, YOU BASTARD!

54
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,840
HERE'S WHAT YOU'LL GET,
YOU MONSTER.

55
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,670
GET IT AWAY!
PUT IT AWAY!

56
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,840
I GOT THE GOLD
FAIR AND SQUARE.
THEM WERE THE RULES.

57
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,560
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!

58
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,140
YOU CAN'T GET AWAY.

59
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,240
LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING?

60
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,400
WHAT DID YOU DO?

61
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,580
Y-Y-YOU KILLED MY WIFE.

62
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,620
HELLO, DAN. I'M OK.
I JUST GOT A LITTLE KINK
IN ME NECK.

63
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,380
I SHOULD'VE KILLED YOU
WHEN I CAUGHT YOU IN IRELAND.

64
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,550
GIVE HIM THE GOLD, DAN.
HE'S A NICE LITTLE LEPRECHAUN.

65
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,970
I'LL GIVE YOU
MORE THAN GOLD!

66
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,640
YOUR BULLETS WON'T
STOP ME FOREVER.
I'LL KEEP COMING BACK.

67
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,260
THE POWER OF THIS CLOVER
WILL KEEP YOU IN THERE
FOREVER.

68
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,340
GET THAT DAMN CLOVER
OFF THIS CRATE!

69
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,850
WHERE'S ME GOLD,
DANNY ME BOY?

70
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,190
DON'T STRAIN YOURSELF, NOW.

71
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,710
NO.NOT GASOLINE.
YOU CAN'T BURN ME.

72
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,250
I WON'T LET YA.

73
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,050
DON'T STRAIN YOURSELF.
YOU'RE NOT AS YOUNG
AS YOU USED TO BE.

74
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,510
YOU MIGHT HAVE A STROKE.

75
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,720
I CURSE YE
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

76
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,810
I'VE TRADED ME SOUL
FOR ME GOLD.

77
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,230
YOU'LL TRADE YOUR LIFE.

78
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,150
IF YOU GIVE ME ME GOLD BACK,
I'LL GO AWAY.

79
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,990
WHAT'S WRONG?

80
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,090
BURN IN HELL,
YOU LITTLE GREEN BASTARD!

81
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,600
DID THE MATCH
GO OUT, DANNY?

82
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,800
10 años después

83
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,320
DAD, I'M SO DEPRESSED.

84
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,370
HERE I AM IN NEW MEXICO
WITH MY HICK FATHER
FOR THE WHOLE SUMMER.

85
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,960
NO OFFENSE.

86
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,710
FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S NOT NEW MEXICO.
IT'S NORTH DAKOTA.

87
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,010
LIKE IT MATTERS.
ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS IT'S NOT L.A.

88
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,660
THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?

89
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,700
THIS IS OUR POOR
NEIGHBORS' HOUSE,

90
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,540
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO TAKE US TO OUR HOUSE.

91
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,960
NEVER JUDGE A BOOK
BY ITS COVER, HONEY.

92
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,760
DAD, THIS BOOK DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE A COVER.

93
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I'M GOING TO BE
MISERABLE HERE!

94
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,780
THERE'S NO SWIMMING POOL,
SHOPPING MALLS OR CABLE.

95
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,740
BET YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A TV.

96
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,950
THIS SURE AIN'T
BEVERLY HILLS.

97
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,580
I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE THIS HOUSE.

98
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,980
CAREFUL.

99
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,500
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT THIS
COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE--

100
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,620
AN OLD BASEMENT.

101
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,920
GREAT PLACE TO STORE ALL
THE ROCKS AND PINE
CONES I'M GOING TO FIND.

102
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,170
OK, IT'S A LITTLE DUSTY.
I ADMIT THAT.

103
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,260
WE'LL JUST CLEAN IT UP A LITTLE BIT,
SPLASH SOME PAINT AROUND.

104
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,260
YOU'D NEED TO SLAP SOME BULLDOZERS
AROUND TO FIX THIS PLACE UP.

105
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,270
OH, GOD! GROSS. COBWEBS.

106
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,980
YOU'RE MAKING TOO BIG A DEAL
OUT OF THIS, HONEY.
THIS IS A GREAT HOUSE.

107
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,400
I GOT A GREAT BUY ON IT.

108
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,150
YEAH, FROM WHO,
DRACULA?

109
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,580
HOW ABOUT I GET A HOTEL
AND YOU CAN COME VISIT...

110
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,240
LIKE ONCE A WEEK?
HEY, I'LL PAY FOR IT.

111
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,370
TORY, HONEY...

112
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,960
YOU REALLY THINK MONEY'S
ALL YOU NEED TO GET BY
IN THIS LIFE?

113
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,550
OK, I'LL GO WITH
THAT THEORY.

114
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,810
DO YOU SEE THAT SPIDER?
IT'S HUGE!

115
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,640
THAT THING
COULD KILL US!

116
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,360
OK, I'M GOING TO TURN AROUND.
AND WALK OUT OF THIS BASEMENT,
GOING BACKTO THE JEEP,

117
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,230
AND MAKEA RESERVATION
AT THE NEAREST HOTEL IN TOWN.

118
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,530
THIS IS WORSE THAN SUMMER CAMP!
I'D RATHER SLEEP IN A TENT!

119
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,870
HOLD ON! HELLO?
WE'RE BREAKING UP.
WAIT

120
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,460
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
A RESERVATION.

121
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,590
YES, I'D LIKE IT TO BE
A REALLY TALL ROOM, AND--

122
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,420
GREAT!
WHO ARE YOU?

123
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,090
I WAS A GUY CARRYING
SOME PAINT THINNER.

124
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,560
HERE. DOES THAT
COVER IT?

125
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,560
YOU KNOCK OVER MY CAN
OF PAINT THINNER, THEN YOU
OFFER ME BUCKS?

126
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,400
OK. HOW ABOUT THAT?
THAT DO IT?

127
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,200
BUT IF YOU SAID
YOU WERE SORRY,
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT.

128
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,830
KEEP THE CHANGE.
I'M IN A BIG HURRY.

129
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,660
IT'S A BIG UGLY DISGUSTING
HOUSE I'D JUST LIKE TO
DISTANCE MYSELF FROM.

130
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,670
WHAT,
THE O'GRADY PLACE?

131
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:26,420
YEAH. IT'S REALLY GROSS.
THERE'S BUGS. THERE'S COBWEBS.
GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT ELSE IS IN THERE.

132
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,840
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

133
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,470
IT'S JUST FUNNY THE WAY
GIRLS ARE ALWAYS AFRAID
OF SPIDERS AND STUFF.

134
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:41,770
DID I MISPLACE
MY s CALENDAR HERE?
"GIRLS"?

135
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,400
LISTEN, BUD, OK?
THIS IS THE NINETIES.
WOMEN ARE TREATED EQUAL.

136
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,530
WELL, FIRST OFF,
MY NAME ISN'T BUD,
IT'S NATHAN.

137
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,780
I DON'T KNOW MANY GUYS
THAT ARE AFRAID OF HOUSES.

138
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,450
OH, IS THAT SO?
YEAH

139
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,200
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEITHER AM I.

140
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,960
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF ANYTHING.

141
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,500
TORY?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

142
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,470
I'M NOT GOING TO
FIGHT YOU ANYMORE.
YOU HATE THE HOUSE--

143
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,340
IT'S DIRTY,
IT'S DUSTY.

144
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,810
YOU REALLY THINK I'M AFRAID
OF A LITTLE DUST AND BUGS?

145
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,390
COME ON, JUST PUT
THE BAGS BACK, OK?

146
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,980
I'M GOING TO STAY.

147
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,820
DAD, WOULD YOU
PUT THE BAGS BACK?
I'M GOING TO STAY.

148
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,790
IT CAME RIGHT DOWN
OUT OF THE SKY.

149
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,840
THERE IT WAS...
THIS FLYING SAUCER.

150
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,300
IT HAD THESE REALLY
WEIRD LIGHTS, YOU KNOW?

151
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,220
AND IT MADE ALL THESE
WEIRD NOISES,
KIND OF LIKE,

152
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,970
OZZIE, I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO TELL ANY MORE STORIES.

153
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:05,310
THIS REALLY HAPPENED, ALEX.
IT DID!

154
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,190
IT--LIKE MAGIC,
YOU KNOW?

155
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,410
LIKE, WHEN YOU SEE A STAR
IN THE NIGHT SKY--
THE FIRST STAR--

156
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,240
YOU CAN MAKE A WISH.
IT'LL COME TRUE.

157
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,040
STOP WITH
THE MAGIC STUFF.

158
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,540
AND NO MORE LIES,
OK?

159
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,210
HOW YOU DOING, BOYS?
I'M J.D.

160
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:34,050
I JUST MET YOUR BROTHER NATHAN.
HI. I'M ALEX. NICE TO MEET YOU.

161
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,300
- THIS IS MY FRIEND OZZIE.
- HI.

162
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,100
SO, YOU BOYS NEED
ANY HELP OUT HERE?

163
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:44,480
OUR LIABILITY INSURANCE FORBIDS
ANYONE BUT US HANDLING
THE TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT,.

164
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,600
BUT THANKS
FOR THE OFFER.

165
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,780
BOY,I COULD GO FOR
A BEER RIGHT NOW.

166
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,330
YOU'RE TOO LITTLE TO DRINK.
DON'T YOU DRINK THAT STUFF!

167
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,540
HEY, OZZIE, WHAT'S THIS?
AH, GOTCHA!

168
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,730
NATHAN?

169
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,760
I'M SORRY. YOU ALL RIGHT?
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
DOWN HERE.

170
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,680
I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE
A PEACE OFFERING,

171
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,640
BUT I THINK IT'S ALL
IN THAT CRATE.

172
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,970
HOPE I DIDN'T RUIN
WHAT'S INSIDE.

173
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,440
YOU COULDN'T DAMAGE
WHAT'S IN HERE.

174
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,810
THE O'GRADYS COLLECTED
A LOT OF JUNK.

175
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,610
- THE O'GRADYS?
- YEAH. DAN O'GRADY.

176
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:19,280
HE USED TO OWN THIS PLACE.
HE WAS REALLY A
WEIRD, STRANGE GUY.

177
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,200
OH. YOU MEAN
WEIRD AND STRANGE.

178
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,080
LIKE GUYS WHO OWN TRUCKS
AND PAINT HOUSES
FOR A LIVING?

179
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,580
HEY, LET'S SEE WHAT
HE'S GOT IN THIS THING.

180
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,590
UNLESS YOU'RE SCARED.

181
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:40,430
SCARED? ME?
GIVE ME A CROWBAR.

182
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,010
GOT A HAMMER.
FINE. A HAMMER IS GOOD.

183
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
THAT SOUNDS
LIKE OZZIE.

184
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,030
BLUE IS NOT
YOUR BEST COLOR.

185
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,570
ALEX, I ASKED YOU TO HOLD
THAT LADDER STEADY.

186
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,160
NOW LOOK WHAT HAPPENED!

187
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,700
I'M NOT EVEN GOING
TO ASK WHAT HAPPENED.

188
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,580
THERE'S A BATHROOM
OFF THE KITCHEN IN THERE.

189
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,290
AT LEAST, IT LOOKED
A LITTLE LIKE A BATHROOM.

190
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,450
HELLO?

191
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,210
WHO'S IN THERE?

192
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,240
HELLO?

193
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,630
WHAT NEAT JUNK.

194
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,130
PLEASE LET ME OUT.
PLEASE?

195
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,680
WHY WON'T YOU LET ME
OUT OF THIS CRATE?

196
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,390
HOW DID YOU
GET IN THERE?

197
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,640
PLEASE...
LET ME OUT.

198
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,310
I DON'T LIKE IT IN HERE.
PLEASE.

199
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,650
HELLO?

200
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,370
I'M BACK!

201
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,750
HEY, TUBBY...
YOU GOT A LIGHT FOR AN
OLD LEPRECHAUN'S PIPE?

202
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,520
I'M STARVED.
HAVEN'T EATEN IN YEARS.

203
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,100
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU?

204
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,150
WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE,
ME LAD?

205
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,820
SEE THE HAT? THE BUCKLES
ON ME SHOES?

206
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,610
WHY,
I'M A LEPRECHAUN!

207
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,370
A SHOEMAKER BY TRADE.
AND SPEAKING OF SHOES...

208
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,750
YOURS COULD USE
A SHINE.
BUT FIRST...

209
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,710
HAVE YOU SEEN A CROCK OF GOLD
LYING AROUND?

210
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,090
TELL ME! OR I'LL BITE
YOUR EAR OFF,

211
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,050
AND I'LL MAKE
A BOOT OUT OF IT.

212
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,230
YOU ONLY GOT AWAY
'CAUSE ME POWERS ARE WEAK.

213
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,110
I NEED ME GOLD!

214
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,200
THERE'S A LEPRECHAUN
IN THE BASEMENT!

215
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,120
HOLD ON!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

216
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,620
HE COME OUT OF A BOX!
HE HAD THESE LONG,
REAL SCARY FINGERS.

217
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:43,210
AND HE ATE A BUG!

218
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:47,420
LEPRECHAUN?
LET'S INJECT A LITTLE
REALITY IN HERE, PLEASE.

219
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:52,010
I SAW HIM! REALLY!
HE TRIED TO
POLISH MY SHOES!

220
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:56,600
THEN WHERE'S
YOUR POT OF GOLD?
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS!

221
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,270
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

222
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,650
IF IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL ANY
BETTER, OZZIE, WE'LL ALL GO
CHECK IT OUT.

223
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,730
DON'T GO IN THERE!

224
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,780
OK?
JUST IN CASE.

225
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,910
I BETTER GO WITH YOU.

226
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,870
JUST IN CASE.

227
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,120
NATHAN...
I DON'T THINK
THAT STICK'S BIG ENOUGH.

228
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,380
WAIT FOR ME. I'M COMIN'.
JUST IN CASE.

229
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:36,810
OZZIE, YOU REALLY
BUSTED UP THIS CRATE.

230
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,680
NO, I DIDN'T DO THAT.

231
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,560
THAT--THAT WAS
THE LEPRECHAUN.

232
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,350
UH-HUH.
LEPRECHAUN.

233
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,940
I DON'T SEE
ANYTHING, OZZIE.

234
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,820
BUT THIS GUY...
WAS REAL.

235
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,450
I MEAN, HE HAD
THE BUCKLES ON HIS SHOES

236
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,710
AND HE HAD THEM
REAL HORRIBLE TEETH,

237
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,670
AND THEY WERE ALL ROTTEN
AND EVERYTHING,

238
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,920
I--I KNOW HE NEVER
DOES BRUSH THEM.

239
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,470
THAT'S HIM

240
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,010
HE'S GOING TO KILL
EVERY ONE OF US,
AND I'M FIRST.

241
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,950
OZZIE, COME HERE!
I AIN'T GOING IN
THAT DARK CORNER!

242
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,030
NEITHER AM I.

243
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,040
WHAT WAS THAT?

244
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,450
HANG ON, HANG ON.

245
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,680
IT'S ONLY A RAT.

246
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,390
IT'S JUST A RAT.

247
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,230
WELL, OZZIE, I THINK
WE FOUND YOUR LEPRECHAUN.

248
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,110
NO. YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

249
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,690
HE WAS BIGGER
THAN THAT.

250
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,650
WE'VE SOLVED THIS MYSTERY.
NOW CAN WE JUST
GET OUT OF HERE?

251
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,090
HEY! HEY, LOOK UP
IN THE SKY!

252
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,760
SO WHAT, OZZIE?
IT'S JUST A RAINBOW.

253
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,590
IT'S A MAGIC RAINBOW.

254
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,100
LEPRECHAUNS AND RAINBOWS...
IT'S A SIGN!

255
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,350
IT'S A SIGN TO GET
BACK TO PAINTING.

256
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,560
NO. WE GOT TO GO SEE
WHAT'S AT THE END.

257
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,360
OZZIE, YOU'RE
EMBARRASSING ME.

258
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,400
COME ON,
GO WITH ME.

259
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,490
WE GOT TO GET TO THE END
OF THE RAINBOW.
THERE'S ALWAYS A POT OF GOLD!

260
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:03,790
HE'S SO EASILY SIDETRACKED.
LIKE ALWAYS, I'LL
TAKE CARE OF IT.

261
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,120
OZZIE, COME ON!
ALEX!

262
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,750
OH, LET THEM GO
CHASE RAINBOWS.

263
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,380
LET'S GO PAINT.
UM, THIS IS
BIODEGRADABLE?

264
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,170
OZZIE, THIS IS STUPID.

265
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,930
YOU CAN'T FIND
THE END OF THE RAINBOW.

266
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,180
IT'S WHERE THE RAINBOW ENDS.
IT DOES SORT OF LOOK
LIKE WHERE IT ENDS.

267
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,730
HEY, LOOK,
IT'S GOING AWAY.

268
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,320
DON'T CUT YOURSELF ON ANY
OF THIS RUSTY OLD METAL.

269
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,780
IF YOU DO, IT'LL MAKE
YOUR JAW LOCK SHUT.

270
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,710
HEY, OZZIE, I GOT AN IDEA.
LET'S HOT-WIRE THIS.

271
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,750
I DON'T THINK THE BATTERY
WOULD BE ANY GOOD.

272
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,590
LOOK AT THAT.

273
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,680
GIVE ME IT.
LET ME LOOK AT IT
FOR A MINUTE.

274
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,180
I'LL GIVE IT BACK
TO YOU. I PROMISE.

275
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,360
GIVE ME THAT.

276
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,610
WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

277
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:24,160
HERE'S YOUR COIN.
I FOUND A BAG
FULL OF THEM.

278
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,040
OH! I TOLD YOU.
I TOLD YOU.

279
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,460
UH-OH. THAT'S WHAT
THAT LEPRECHAUN
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

280
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,540
WOULD YOU STOP WITH
THAT STUPID STUFF?

281
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:38,170
WE FOUND THIS GOLD.
FINDERS KEEPERS.

282
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,720
I JUST HOPE
IT'S REAL.

283
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,470
I KNOW HOW TO TELL
IF IT'S REAL.
YOU BITE ON IT.

284
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,560
OH, MY GOD.
I SWALLOWED
THAT GOLD COIN

285
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,560
NICE GOING, JAWS.

286
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,690
CAN YOU DIE
FROM SWALLOWING GOLD?

287
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,570
YEAH, AFTER I KILL YOU!
YOU JUST LET ME
TAKE CHARGE, OK?

288
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:08,030
I'M GOING TO KEEP ONE.
I CAN GET IT
CHECKED OUT IN TOWN.

289
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,080
WE'VE GOT TO HIDE
THE REST.

290
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,910
WE CAN'T TELL ANYONE
ABOUT THIS.

291
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,080
RIGHT, RIGHT. WHY?

292
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,420
'CAUSE YOU KNOW HOW ADULTS
ARE, ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT COMES TO MONEY.

293
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,720
THEY'LL TRY
TO TAKE IT AWAY.

294
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,470
LET'S HIDE IT IN
THE OLD WELL
BESIDE THE HOUSE.

295
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,680
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS?

296
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,730
WE'RE RICH, AND I CAN
BUY COMICS EVERY WEEK.

297
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,320
- YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
- WHAT ELSE?

298
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,650
- WE CAN GET YOU AN OPERATION.
- FOR WHAT?

299
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,110
TO MAKE YOU SMART.

300
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,910
WE CAN GO TO THE HOSPITAL
AND HAVE THEM OPERATE
AND FIX YOUR BRAIN.

301
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,710
BUT...BUT
I--I'M SMART.

302
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,710
YEAH. WELL, SORT OF.
WHAT I MEAN IS WE CAN
MAKE YOU REAL SMART.

303
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,630
THAT WAY, PEOPLE
WON'T MAKE FUN OF YOU.

304
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:07,220
- THEY MAKE FUN OF ME?
- NOT IN FRONT OF YOU.
ONLY BEHIND YOUR BACK.

305
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,760
LET'S GO TO THE WELL.

306
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,310
COME ON.

307
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,960
HERE. START IN THE CORNERS.
NICE, EVEN STROKES.

308
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,750
THAT'S IT.
YOU GOT IT.

309
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,510
NOT BAD, HUH?

310
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,760
YEAH,
A REGULAR PICASSO.

311
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,720
PUT ME OUT OF BUSINESS.

312
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,430
OH, WE NEED ANOTHER CAN
OF PAINT.

313
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,970
JUST WATCH HOW A PRO
GETS A CAN OF PAINT.

314
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,770
LET ME GET A RAG FIRST.
GO AHEAD.

315
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,710
NATHAN.

316
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,420
NATHAN, COME ON,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

317
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,350
OH, MY GOD.

318
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,850
OH, JEEZ.

319
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,850
HONEY, ARE YOU OK?
I HEARD YOU SCREAM.

320
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,150
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU
RUBBING MY LEG.
AND YOU LET ME?

321
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:50,860
SOMETHING WAS RUBBING
MY LEG, CARESSING IT.

322
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,370
IT'S PROBABLY
JUST A POSSUM.

323
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,080
I KNOW WHAT CARESSING
MY LEG FEELS LIKE.

324
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,040
YOU DO?

325
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,500
WE GOT TO GET
THESE CUTS CLEANED UP.

326
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,050
- I SHOULD LOOK
FOR THAT ANIMAL.

327
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,260
WHY?
IT MIGHT HAVE RABIES.

328
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,470
Great!

329
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,930
IT WAS A CAT.
I THINK WE FOUND
YOUR SECRET ADMIRER.

330
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,480
IT WASN'T A CAT.

331
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,650
IT SOUNDS HURT.

332
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,940
COME ON, KITTY, KITTY.

333
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,630
WHAT?

334
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,920
THAT CAT BIT ME.

335
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,300
PUT PRESSURE ON IT.

336
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,970
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.

337
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:58,310
WE'RE TAKING HIM TO
THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

338
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,400
SHOOT,
THE DISTRIBUTOR CAP.

339
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,790
COME ON, COME ON!

340
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:50,110
WE MAY BE A WHILE.
GET A BITE TO EAT.
WE'LL SEE YOU SOON.

341
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,530
ALL RIGHT.

342
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,910
HERE'S OUR CHANCE.
WHAT, TO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT?

343
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,120
NO, TO CHECK OUT THE GOLD COIN.
COME ON.
IT'S GETTING DARK.

344
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:22,930
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A COIN LIKE THIS.

345
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,400
THE SYMBOLS--INCREDIBLY
STRANGE MARKINGS.

346
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,400
WHAT'S IT WORTH?

347
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,780
WELL, IF THIS IS
SOLID GOLD,

348
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,360
COULD BE WORTH $.500

349
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:43,540
BUT THERE'S
HISTORICAL VALUE.
IT COULD BE PRICELESS.

350
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,580
COULD I KEEP THIS
OVERNIGHT AND STUDY IT?

351
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,000
YOU WON'T LOSE IT?

352
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,760
NO, I'LL PUT IT IN MY SAFE.
I'LL WRITE UP A RECEIPT.

353
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,550
YOU RECKON THAT COIN MIGHT HAVE
COME FROM A LEPRECHAUN?

354
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,720
NEVER MIND.

355
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:09,270
OK, WE'LL COME BACK TOMORROW,
AND LET'S JUST KEEP THIS BETWEEN US.

356
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:14,230
WE'D BETTER GET TO THE RESTAURANT.
THEY'RE GONNA BE PISSED
WE WERE GONE SO LONG.

357
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,370
I MUST BE HEARING THINGS.

358
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,380
OK. I'LL GET THIS
PUT AWAY HERE.

359
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,640
I WANT ME GOLD COIN!

360
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,110
ME COIN!

361
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,070
IT'S NOT NICE TO STEAL GOLD
COINS FROM A LEPRECHAUN.

362
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,530
BAD SHOP OWNER.
BAD SHOP OWNER.

363
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,290
I'LL BE BACK.

364
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,250
NOW WE'RE GOING TO PLAY.
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH ME?

365
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:48,010
THIS OLD LEP, HE PLAYED ONE
HE PLAYED POGO ON HIS LUNG

366
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,730
TEACH YOU TO STEAL
ME GOLD.

367
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,650
OH. CAN'T HAVE
DIRTY SHOES NOW, CAN WE?

368
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,610
THERE.
NICE AND SHINY.

369
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,240
OH. HE'LL BOUNCE BACK
IN NO TIME.

370
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,290
ONE GOLD COIN... TO GO.

371
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,210
BY THE LUCK OF THE IRISH.

372
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,990
ARE YOU SURE
YOU TOLD OZZIE AND ALEX
WHERE THIS PLACE IS?

373
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,830
RELAX. THEY'RE KIDS.
PROBABLY STOPPED OFF

374
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,750
TO BUY OZZIE A COMIC
OR SOMETHING.

375
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:02,300
BOY, WHAT A NIGHT. MY FIRST DAY HERE,
AND MY FATHER ENDS UP IN THE HOSPITAL.

376
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,090
IT'S JUST FOR OBSERVATION.
HE'LL BE FINE
IN THE MORNING.

377
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,970
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.
THE WORST IS OVER.

378
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,580
SAY, AREN'T WE A LITTLE YOUNG
TO BE OUT THIS LATE?

379
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,920
NO. I'M YEARS OLD.

380
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,050
OK, SMART ASS...

381
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:30,680
TAKE THAT RIDICULOUS MASK OFF
AND STEP OUT OF THE CAR.

382
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,430
IT'S NOT NICE TO MAKE
FUN OF A LEPRECHAUN.

383
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,600
IS THAT SO? SO NOW
YOU'RE A LEPRECHAUN, HUH?

384
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,080
YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ANYTHING?

385
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,870
NO. I MEAN YES,
I DO WANT SOMETHING.

386
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,960
WHAT I WANTED WAS A WATERCRESS
SALAD AND AN EVIAN WATER.

387
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,340
BUT THEY DON'T
HAVE THAT HERE.

388
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,510
ALL THEY HAVE IS CHEAP
WHISKEY AND WARM BEER.

389
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,840
WELL, HERE'S YOUR WATER.

390
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,430
JEEZ. THANKS.

391
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,370
GET AWAY FROM ME,
YOU LITTLE CREEP!

392
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,700
SO YOU WANT TO PLAY
HIDE-AND-SEEK, HUH?

393
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,710
OVER HERE.

394
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,640
I'M OVER HERE.

395
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,900
STOP.

396
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,860
NO MORE.

397
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,760
NO MORE.

398
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,310
WHERE THE FUCK
ARE YOU?

399
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,070
OH, THANK GOD.

400
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,820
NOW, THAT WAS FUN.

401
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,030
YOU KNOW, TORY, YOU LOOK
A LITTLE SKINNY.

402
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:04,030
NO OFFENSE, BUT, UH...

403
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,370
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SOME MEAT LOAF.

404
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:10,830
OH, NO. DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?
YEAH, IT'S MEAT LOAF.

405
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:14,210
NO. THAT'S CUT-UP,
DEAD COW.

406
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,710
AND THAT'S IF YOU'RE
LUCKY IN THIS PLACE.
I DON'T EAT MEAT,

407
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,130
AND I DON'T KILL LIVING THINGS.
I FEEL VERY STRONGLY
ABOUT THAT.

408
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,680
REALLY?
REALLY.

409
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,690
NATHAN, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

410
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:35,360
CUT-UP, DEAD COW. THAT'S
WHAT YOUR SHOE IS.

411
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,610
GIVE ME MY SHOE.

412
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:41,150
NATHAN, GIVE ME
MY SHOE BACK.

413
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:47,410
ALEX AND OZZIE ARE COMING.
WOULD YOU TRY TO SET
A MATURE EXAMPLE?

414
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,330
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

415
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,410
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

416
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,130
WE WENT DOWN
TO THAT PLACE.

417
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,350
NOW, WHERE'S ME CROCK
OF GOLD?

418
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,130
I WANT ME GOLD.

419
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,210
GOD.

420
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:07,670
UH-OH. I THINK SOMETHING
GOT IN HERE.
NO SHIT, SHERLOCK.

421
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,800
YOU'D BETTER WATCH YOUR MOUTH.
GO WASH IT OUT WITH SOAP
RIGHT NOW, BOY.

422
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,260
SURE. SURE. AND RIGHT
AFTER THAT, OZZIE,

423
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:18,890
I'LL BE SURE TO GROUND
MYSELF FOR WEEKS.

424
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:23,230
THIS IS CRAZY.
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

425
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:26,650
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BEAR.
THEY SOMETIMES COME DOWN
FROM THE HILLS FOR FOOD.

426
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,910
MY DAD HAD TO BRING
FOOD INTO THIS PLACE.

427
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:34,080
THAT LEPRECHAUN, HE TRIED
TO SHINE MY SHOES.

428
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,410
HE SAID HE WAS
A SHOEMAKER.

429
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,410
YOU GUYS CAN SIT
AROUND HERE AND THEORIZE.

430
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,420
BEAR OR NO BEAR,
I AM GETTING OUT OF HERE.

431
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,130
I'M WALKING OUT THAT DOOR,
AND I'M NOT COMING BACK.

432
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,930
A LITTLE TOO DARK
OUT THERE.

433
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,730
LET'S CLEAN
THIS PLACE UP.

434
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,610
HERE. YOU KNOW HOW TO WORK
ONE OF THESE, RIGHT?

435
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,370
WE FINALLY GOT THAT
KITCHEN STRAIGHTENED UP.

436
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,460
YEAH, I'M REALLY BEGINNING
TO GET THE HANG OF THIS THING.

437
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:27,300
WHAT'S THAT?

438
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,710
IT SOUNDS LIKE A BELL.

439
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,270
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

440
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,070
GREAT, OZZIE.

441
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,490
I'M GOING TO GO
CHECK OUT THE BEDROOMS

442
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:57,660
AND FIND OUT WHERE WE'RE
GOING TO STAY TONIGHT.

443
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:12,380
ALEX, DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD KILL A LEPRECHAUN?

444
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:15,180
OZZIE, YOU CAN KILL
ANYTHING.

445
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,510
YOU JUST GOT TO KNOW
HOW TO DO IT.

446
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,430
NOW, ME, GIVE ME
A . MAGNUM,

447
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,770
PRESS IT TO THE LITTLE
GREEN CRITTER'S TEMPLE,
AND BLAM!

448
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:29,440
BRAINS AND GUTS DRIPPING
ALL DOWN ITS HEAD.

449
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,650
THE GUY IS GONE
WITH A CAPITAL DEAD.

450
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:44,370
OZZIE, WILL YOU CUT IT OUT
WITH THAT STUPID BELL?

451
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:56,470
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S
COMING FROM THE KITCHEN.

452
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:16,280
WE'RE, LIKE,
REALLY SCARED.

453
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,120
STAY HERE. I'M GOING
TO CHECK IT OUT

454
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,490
NATHAN, BE CAREFUL.

455
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,240
OH, MY LEG!

456
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:09,120
I GOT YOU
IN A BEAR TRAP

457
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:13,130
I GOT YOU IN A BEAR TRAP
YOU LOOK LIKE A STUPID SAP

458
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,430
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HURT.

459
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:21,800
LET'S PLAY SURGEON.

460
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,490
NATHAN!
TORY, NO!
GET BACK.

461
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,580
OH, MY GOD.
CALL THE POLICE!

462
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,460
GET OFF!

463
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:52,170
YOU CAN'T HURT ME.

464
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,880
ALEX, GET THE SHOTGUN.

465
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,390
HURRY UP, ALEX!

466
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,060
HELP! HELP!
IT'S HAPPENING!

467
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,930
THE ATTACK IS ON
O'GRADY FARM!

468
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,480
SEND HELP. THE LEPRECHAUN
IS ATTACKING!
ARMY, NAVY, GUNS, MARINES,

469
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,650
AND WE'LL NEED
SOME MEDICINE.
OK, THANKS.

470
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:20,150
HEY, SHERIFF, I GOT
A CALL FROM OZZIE

471
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,370
HE SAYS THE LEPRECHAUN
IS ATTACKING.

472
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:29,160
WHAT WAS IT LAST WEEK?
WAS IT UFOs?

473
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,540
HE'S A GOOD BOY.

474
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:37,130
A LEPRECHAUN.

475
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,220
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

476
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,390
TAKE IT.

477
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,220
KILL HIM! KILL HIM!

478
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,400
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, OZZIE?
HURRY UP!

479
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,270
GET ALEX ON THE PORCH!
I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO THE PORCH!

480
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,750
HE WENT OFF
INTO THE BUSHES.

481
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,720
GOD. NATHAN, THAT WAS
NO FUCKING BEAR.

482
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,310
MY GOD. GONE.

483
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,900
GOD, NATHAN, YOUR LEG.
LOOK AT IT.

484
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,150
WE GOT TO CALL A PARAMEDIC.
I TOOK CARE OF IT.

485
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:47,320
I TOLD THEM WE NEEDED THE ARMY,
MEDICINE,

486
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,740
AND A PARAMEDIC.

487
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:53,660
OZZIE, YOU DIDN'T
TELL THEM THAT IT WAS
A LEPRECHAUN, DID YOU?

488
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:58,710
OF COURSE I DID.
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS,
WASN'T IT?

489
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:01,460
WE JUST GOT TO GET HIM
BACK TO THE HOUSE.

490
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,270
SHIT! THE LINE'S DEAD.

491
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:16,980
ALEX, YOU EVER IN THE BOY SCOUTS?
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.
HELP ME WITH THIS.

492
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,110
STOP THE BLEEDING.
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

493
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,480
GET EVERYTHING YOU CAN--
TISSUE, ALCOHOL, COTTON.

494
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,820
TORY, DID THAT THING LOOK
LIKE A LEPRECHAUN TO YOU?

495
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:29,320
OZZIE, GO!
COME ON.

496
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:32,990
YOU'LL BE OK, NATHAN.

497
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,830
OK, SO, SOON AS WE STOP THE
BLEEDING, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
NATHAN TO THE PICKUP.

498
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:40,590
BUT WHAT IF IT'S

499
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:45,260
NO WAY. I PUT ROUNDS
INTO THAT THING.

500
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,840
IT'S GOT TO BE DEAD.

501
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:52,890
ALEX, GET ME SOME ICE.
WE'LL STOP THE SWELLING

502
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,480

505
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,040
DID YOU SEE HIM?

506
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,670
OH, GOD, THAT HURTS.

00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,460
GET HIM IN THE TRUCK.
WHAT IF HE COMES?

508
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,510

509
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,350
OK, WE MADE IT.

510
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:41,310

514
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,900
AHH, LET ME IN!

515
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,610

516
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:08,860
MY--MY EAR!
HE GOT MY EAR!

517
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,370
WHAT THE HECK IS
HE DOING IN THERE?

518
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,010
RING AROUND THE ROSIE
A POCKETFUL OF POSIES

519
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:35,300
FASTER! FASTER!

520
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:49,820
ASHES, ASHES

521
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,580
WHERE'D YOU GO,

00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,720
OK, LET'S GO NOW.

525
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,640

01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,060
PHONE. PHONE.

528
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,810

OK...MY PORTABLE!

530
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:21,320
HELLO? I NEED THE POLICE.

THIS IS TORY REDDING.
I'M CALLING FROM THE O'GRADY FARM.

532
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:30,250
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED.
WE NEED YOU TO SEND

533
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:34,000
OK, PLEASE HURRY. YOU'VE GOT--

01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,720

540
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,740
THIS IS SHERIFF CRONAN.

541
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:06,080
WE GOT A CALL FROM OVER THERE AT
THE O'GRADY FARM.

542
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,830
A FEMALE CALLED TORY REDING

543
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,080
GET OUT THERE. ON A CODE 1
PRIORITY RIGHT AWAY.

544
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:18,260
ROGER, SHERIFF.
MY E.T.A. IS LESS THAN 3 MINUTES.

545
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:21,680
IF I NEED BACKUP,
I'LL CALL IT IN.

546
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,680
YOU GOT THE BACK DOOR, RIGHT?

547
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,810
RIGHT, AND THE BASEMENT WINDOWS
ARE LOCKED UP TIGHT.

548
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,140
NOW, DOUBLE-CHECK THE WINDOWS
IN THE KITCHE

549
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:33,810
MY EAR SURE HURTS.

550
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,730
I BET THAT LEPRECHAUN
MADE A BOOT OUT OF IT.

551
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:41,070
HE DIDN'T GET YOU EAR.
HE JUST BIT IT.

552
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:45,530
- WHERE THE HELL IS THE POLICE?
- THEY SHOULD BE HERE BY NOW.

553
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:54,000
NOW I'M GONNA MAKE TIGHT.

554
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,090
TOO TIGHT?
NO, IT'S ALRIGHT.

555
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,550
THAT LEPRECHAUN SURE IS MEAN.

556
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:02,300
IT IS NOT A LEPRECHAUN
DAMM IT.

557
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:07,600
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT THING WAS,
BUT IT'S NOT A LEPRECHAUN.

558
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,770
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

559
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:14,730
WHAT ABOUT THE GOLD IN THE
OLD, RUSTY CAR.

560
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,530
NEVER MIND WHAT I JUST SAID

561
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:23,410
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "GOLD"?

562
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,620
ALEX, TELL ALEX THE GOLD.

563
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:38,420
WE WERE GONNA SAVE IT TO GET
OZZIE AN OPERATION.

564
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:42,170
ALEX, YOU CAN'T FIX OZZIE'S BRAIN.

565
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:45,970
I KNOW THAT,
BUT HE DOESN'T.

566
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,810
TELL ME ABOUT THE GOLD.

567
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,270
IN THE WATER BUCKET, RIGHT?

568
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:53,600
JUST PULL IT UP AND THERE'S
A BAG OF GOLD COINS.

569
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:55,650
IT'S GOTTA WORK.

570
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,770
ALL HE WANTS IS HE GOLD,
HE'S GOTTA LEAVE US ALONE.

571
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:03,570
NO, YOU'RE HURT TOO BAD.

572
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:05,450
SIT DOWN.

573
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,410
LOOK, JUST TAKE THIS GUN
WITH YOU, OK?

574
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:12,540
JUST COCK AND AIM ITT
AND PULL THE TRIGGER.

575
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:15,960
YOU EVER WORKED ONE OF
THOSE THINGS BEFORE?

576
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,670
NO.

577
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:26,470
WATCH OUT FOR THOSE TEETH.

578
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,870
COME ON.

579
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,010
IS THAT ME GOLD?
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?

580
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:47,760
I'M A LEPRECHAUN, ME DEAR.

581
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,510

01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:55,970

583
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,770
IT SOUNDS LIKE ME GOLD...

584
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:07,650
IT LOOKS LIKE ME GOLD...

585
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:14,870
IT SMELLS LIKE ME GOLD...

586
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,080
IT TAKES LIKE ME GOLD...

587
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,040
OH, GOD.

ME DELICIOUS GOLD.

589
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,470
BE CALM, BE CALM.

590
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,770
OK, HE TOOK IT.

591
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:41,270
HE GOT WHAT HE WANTED.

592
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:45,230
NOW WE'LL GET HIM TO A HOSPITAL.
AND CALL FOR HELP.

593
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:54,160
94, 95...

594
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:59,790
96, 97...

595
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:04,130
98, 99.

596
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:15,180
A MISSING COIN?
I'VE BEEN TRICKED.

597
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:18,180
THEY'VE GOT ME COIN.

598
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:22,140
NO ONE TAKES A LEPRECHAUN'S GOLD

599
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,480
ALEX, YOU GOTTA GET ICE FOR OZZIE'S EAR.
AND BOIL SOME WATER.

600
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:30,490
I'LL COVER YA.

601
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,840
COOKING, KIDS?

602
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,270
IT'S IN THE CABINETS.

603
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:08,770
OK TORY I WANT YOU TO OPEN THEM
AND GET BACK QUICKLY, OK

607
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,760
YOU MISSED ME!

608
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:40,810
WHERE IS HE?

609
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,430
YOU CAN NEVER CATCH
A LEPRECHAUN.

610
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,850
THERE HE GOES.
HE'S GETTING AWAY.

611
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:49,480
WHERE DID HE GO?
HE WENT IN THERE!

612
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,570
STAY WITH OZZIE.

613
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:21,760
I AM RIGHT HERE.
AND I AIN'T NO SANTA CLAUS.

614
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,060
YOU GOT THE SUCKER.

615
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:31,940
BE CAREFUL.

616
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,040
YOU THINK HE'S DEAD?

617
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,710
YEAH, HE'S DEAD

618
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,390
NOT A CHANCE, ME LAD.

619
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:33,080
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.

620
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:50,690
COME ON.

621
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,360
HE'S IN THERE.

622
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,490
WAIT. HE'S IN THE BASEMENT.

623
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:03,660
HE'S OVER THERE,
I HEAR HIM.

624
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,740
LISTEN

625
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,540
THERE HE IS,
RIGHT HERE

626
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:14,380
COME ON YOU LITTLE GREEN THING.

627
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,460
WHERE IS HE?

628
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:21,300
HE'S OUTSIDE
HE'S GONE

629
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:31,180
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

630
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,650
DO YOU HEAR ANYTHING?

631
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,450
HE WENT DOWN THE BASEMENT.

632
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:51,160
HELLO? HELPS US PLEASE.
WE'RE TRAPPED INSIDE HERE

633
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:54,080
WHERE'S THE REST
OF ME GOLD?

634
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,940
HAVING PROBLEMS?
DO YOU NEED A HAND?

635
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:25,530
WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON?
WE GAVE HIM HIS GOLD.

636
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:29,120
WE GAVE HIM HIS GOLD.

637
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:32,700
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT HE WANTS.

638
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,960
WHAT?

639
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,590
HE WANTS HIS LAST GOLD COIN.

640
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:41,250
STOP HIM! HE'S GOT THE LAST
GOLD COIN IN HIS STOMACH.

641
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,630
YOU CAN'T GO OUT THERE.

642
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:49,640
THERE'S GOTTA BE ANOTHER WAY.
THAT THING IS A LEPRECHAUN
AND WE HAVE TO STOP IT.

643
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:53,390
THE OLD O'GRADY, HE MIGHT
KNOW HOW TO KILL IT.

644
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:58,520
WHEN I WAS A KID, HE USED TO TELL ME
STORIES ABOUT FAIRES AND LEPRECHAUNS.

645
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:02,400
IF ANYBODY WOULD KNOW HOW TO
KILL THIS THING, HE WOULD.

646
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,700
HE OWNS THIS HOUSE
HE PROBABLY PUT THAT THING
IN ITS CRATE.

647
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,660
WHERE IS HE?

648
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,910
OLD MAN O'GRADY,
HE'S IN A REST HOME

649
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:13,910
HE HAD A STROKE ABOUT
10 YEARS AGO.

650
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,710
WE GOTTA GOT THERE RIGHT NOW
HOW WE GONNA GET THERE?

651
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:19,000
THE JEEP.

652
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,840
WAIT A SEC,
I GOT AN IDEA.

653
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,850
ALEX, DON'T LOCK.

654
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:10,590
HELLO, LOVE

655
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,390
FARTHER!

656
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:26,190
SHINY-SHINY

657
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:34,780
WE'RE CLEAR.
I'LL BE BACK

658
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:58,530
MR. O'GRADY, IT'S OUT.
IT'S OUT OF THE CRATE.

659
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:03,450
NO ONE BELIEVED IT
WAS A LEPRECHAUN.

660
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:07,790
I BELIEVE IT.
HOW DO WE STOP IT?

661
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:11,710
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO KILL
A LEPRECHAUN.

662
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:13,630
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU.

663
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,510
I'LL NEVER TELL YA.

664
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:56,090
OPEN UP, OPEN UP

665
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:32,540
HE CAME BACK FOR ME.
I KNEW HE WOULD BUT,
NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE ME.

666
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:35,710
WE GOTTA GET YOU DOWN.

667
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:41,130

669
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,390
HOW CAN WE KILL IT?

670
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:52,690
A FOUR-LEAF CLOVER
FROM THE CLOVER PATCH

671
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:55,650
BESIDES THE WELL.

672
01:18:55,730 --> 01:19:04,820
YOU GOTTA PUT IT ON HIS BODY.
HE HAS TO TOUCH IT,
THEN YOU CAN KILL IT.

673
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:13,600
LITTLE GIRLS SHOULDN'T BE
LOOKING FOR CLOVERS.

674
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:26,740

675
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,300

01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:04,540
O'GRADY SAID WE NEED TO HAVE
A FOUR-LEAF CLOVER.

684
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:08,050
WE BETTER GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE THAT THING WAKES UP

685
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:11,890
THERE'S GOTTA BE A FOUR-LEAF CLOVER,

686
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:13,720
OK, COME ON, LET'S GO

687
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:23,020
WE'RE NEVER GONNA FIND A
FOUR-LEAF CLOVER IN HERE.

688
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:26,320
YES WE CAN.
I FOUND MANY WHEN I WAS A KID.

689
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:34,660
HEY!

690
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,830

691
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,380
I'M NOT AFRAID.
I CAN GET THAT LEPRECHAUN

692
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:03,020
PLEASE DON'T BE HERE YET.

693
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:08,730
I KNOW I CAN GET HIM.
I'M NOT AFRAID.

694
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,610
I'LL KILL HIM.

695
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:18,120
I CAN GET HIM.
I'M NOT AFRAID.

696
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:37,300

AND YOUR STUPID FANTASIES.

700
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:53,320
...TO SIT HERE AND
LOOK FOR CLOVES

701
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,490
THAT THING'S GONNA WAKE UP.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR FAITH.

702
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:59,280
YOU GOTTA BELIEVE.
YOU GOT TO.

703
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:04,660
