1
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,026
Jimmy.

2
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,234
Yeah, Coach?

3
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,238
They're threatening to cancel the meet.

4
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,608
Seems somebody saw you get off the bus.

5
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,782
It's the same old story. They...

6
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,112
Yeah.

7
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,524
Damn it, Jimmy. I'm sorry, man.
They put me in a hell of a bind.

8
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,855
No, no, no. It's cool. It's cool.

9
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,562
-Son, where are you going?
-You gonna ask them to change their mind?

10
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,525
My daddy always used to tell me,

11
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:47,436
"It's a lot easier to ask for forgiveness
than permission."

12
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,468
You ready?

13
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,238
-We're swimming?
-Yeah, we're swimming.

14
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,074
I'm so ready.

15
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,512
-Okay, while you're seeing to things...
-Yeah?

16
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,380
...you see to it that that bus keeps running

17
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:03,183
'cause I know how you white folks get
when y'all lose.

18
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,781
-And they about to lose bad.
-You are a handful.

19
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,509
Swimmers, step up.

20
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,353
Focus.

21
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,782
Come on, Jimmy.

22
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,047
Just stay calm.

23
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,386
Look, if they don't want us to swim here,
that's fine, we'll go home.

24
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,822
We're a team.

25
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,486
-Hell, I've worked so hard.
-I know but...

26
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,190
-I've worked so hard to get here.
-I know, Jimmy.

27
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,493
-Come here, boy.
-What? I'm gonna get arrested now?

28
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,092
Start moving towards your bus
and calm your black ass down.

29
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm not taking my black ass anywhere.

30
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:03,735
Why don't you shut your white ass up
and let me exercise my first amendment?

31
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,970
-'Cause this is wrong.
-Jimmy, Jimmy.

32
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,876
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

33
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,246
Hey, kid, get off of him!

34
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,643
Stop!

35
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,186
Get off that boy!

36
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,091
Don't fight them, Jimmy!

37
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,187
I got my rights!

38
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,027
I got my own rights.

39
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,697
Damn!

40
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:52,401
Mr. Binkowski, I really think
I could prove myself to be a great asset

41
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,473
to your...

42
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,644
-Listen...
-...program here.

43
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,886
-...James?
-Yeah.

44
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,083
-Yeah.
-Jim, actually.

45
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,716
Jim? Yeah.

46
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,991
-Do you golf?
-No.

47
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,898
If you look at my resume, you'll see
that I've got a B.S. in Mathematics

48
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:19,529
and I also swam for Cheyney for four years.

49
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,234
Yeah.
Yeah, can I be perfectly frank with you?

50
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,135
-That would make my day.
-Okay, good.

51
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,507
Well, here at Main Line, obviously,

52
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,138
we have a certain level of excellence
that we strive for.

53
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,307
-It's all around you.
-Yeah, well,

54
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,352
see, that's one of the things
that attracted me to this institution.

55
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,921
Because I really think...

56
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,547
I just don't think a person like yourself

57
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,559
could communicate properly
with our students.

58
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,028
I'm sorry.

59
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,295
-I'll keep you on file.
-Yeah.

60
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,680
Thirty-three!

61
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,152
Thirty-three!

62
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,722
Forty-five! Number 45!

63
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,558
Number 87!

64
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,199
How you doing?

65
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:26,135
Here's my number and resume.

66
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,300
And the form you asked for.

67
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,934
-A degree in Mathematics?
-Yes.

68
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,240
I'm a graduate of Cheyney State.

69
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,339
You know, it took me a little
longer than most but...

70
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,747
-Yeah, well.
-...I finished.

71
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,843
You skipped a spot there.

72
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,854
You ever been arrested?

73
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,460
If you look right here, I've marked no.

74
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,761
Mr. Ellis, you've been bouncing around
quite a bit.

75
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,831
What finally brought you to Philly?

76
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,943
I had a teaching

77
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,773
position opportunity at Main Line Academy.

78
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,146
You? Up at Main Line?

79
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,517
Hey, that's funny.

80
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,647
I guess we don't have enough work
for you college boys.

81
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,091
Look, mister,

82
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,163
just give me whatever you got right now.

83
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:33,227
I'm not looking for a career,
I'm just trying to find a job.

84
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:38,299
Well, here's one more suited for you
down at the PDR.

85
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,776
What's PDR?

86
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,940
It stands for
Philadelphia Department of Recreation.

87
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,677
They probably got a job down at

88
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,754
Foster Recreation Center
right here in Nicetown.

89
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,652
The city is gonna tear down
that building in a couple of months

90
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,850
and they need someone to go down there,
wrap things up.

91
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,019
The salary won't make you rich
but it's decent.

92
00:09:56,128 --> 00:10:00,656
Now, you be down there tomorrow at 9:.00,
you got yourself a job.

93
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,046
Hakim, come on, man.

94
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,609
-I'm right here.
-Hey, Hakim.

95
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:22,814
-See me now?
-Okay.

96
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,049
Now you see me. Now you don't.

97
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,633
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

98
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,945
I'm open still.

99
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,844
You got a man open.
You got a man open. He's open.

100
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,082
What the hell are you yelling about?

101
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,655
You terrible, man. You suck.

102
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,452
-What is that? Is this wrestling?
-Go, get the ball.

103
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,253
-Get the ball?
-Hey, pops.

104
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,657
-Hey, pops.
-Go, get the ball.

105
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,753
Hey, pops, pass the ball right here.

106
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,525
-Right here.
-Hey, mister, pass the ball.

107
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,429
No, no, no, not there.
Come here, right here.

108
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,469
-Don't pass it to him.
-Don't give it to him.

109
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,595
-Thanks.
-Why you give it to him, man?

110
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,765
Hey, what's wrong with you, man?

111
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,775
You throw like my sister, anyway.

112
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,937
Say, man, your iron broke at home?

113
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,572
Them threads,
he's sort of wrinkled there, brother.

114
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,447
Yo, my man, I didn't know Converse
made church shoes, for real.

115
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,746
What is that?

116
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,482
Hey, hey, hey, brother, yo,
the church is across the street.

117
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,082
Yo, man, hey!
What, we not friends no more?

118
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,526
It's like that, brother?

119
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,825
No problem, it's all right, man.
We just playing.

120
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,957
Hey, brother, wait. You work for the city?

121
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,502
-What?
-For your mom.

122
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,468
Reggie's got the ball, man.

123
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,097
-Reggie's got the ball, man.
-Get the ball, man.

124
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,335
Yo, man. Hey. Hey, wait.

125
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,968
-ls he retarded?
-Hey.

126
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,944
-Stop playing.
-Man.

127
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,571
Why we got to hang out
with this fool, anyway?

128
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,412
-Shoot, Reg. Go ahead, man.
-Shoot it in. Shoot it in.

129
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,782
-Oh, shit!
-He broke the radio.

130
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,752
-Franklin's radio.
-See?

131
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,586
That's right. My name's Hewitt.
I didn't do it.

132
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,524
Who broke my shit?

133
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,166
I wasn't even...

134
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,202
I didn't mean to. I was...

135
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,131
What do you propose to do about that?

136
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,802
I...

137
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,574
What is wrong with this little nigger, man?
The cat got his tongue?

138
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:33,448
-I'm waiting, little man.
-Franklin, man. Cool it, brother. Just...

139
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,179
Just leave him alone.

140
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,779
-He didn't mean it. It was an air ball.
-Dre-T.

141
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,323
Don't tell me you ditched me
to run around with this little dope.

142
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,595
-Hey, come on, Reg.
-It's like that, huh?

143
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,462
-Just stay home.
-Well, somebody gonna pay for this.

144
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,062
We ain't done yet, Dre-T.
We ain't never done.

145
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,973
That little shadow of yours owes me.

146
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,408
Look, it's not important.

147
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,383
It's not happening anymore
so let's not talk about it, okay?

148
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,216
The only thing that really, really matters is

149
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,688
that you're getting a divorce from Jack.

150
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,352
After that, everything's gonna be just fine.

151
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,665
Excuse me, sir. My name's Jim Ellis.

152
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,792
City sent me down here to...

153
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,972
Excuse me. Sir.

154
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,844
This is the Foster Rec Center, right?

155
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,381
Trish, you don't have to cry.

156
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,907
What's the sign say?

157
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,181
-lt don't say nothing at all, man.
-First of all, I'm not your man.

158
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,089
If I were your man, that'd imply I was funny

159
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,059
Iike one of those sister-boys or something.

160
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,357
I'm far from being one of those sister-boys.

161
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:56,059
So, if you're in the market for one,
I suggest you go downtown

162
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,227
or move to California.

163
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,396
'Cause ain't no funny here.

164
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,035
All right, whatever.

165
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:09,046
Like I said, city sent me down here
to pack up this place.

166
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,276
'Cause they're closing it down
in a few months and...

167
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,312
Told me to be here at 9:.00 so...

168
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,947
What the clock say?

169
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,763
-It's broken.
-Once again, I didn't ask you that.

170
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,532
-What the clock say?
-Man, it don't say nothing at all. It...

171
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,435
-What is your problem, dude?
-What's my problem?

172
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,068
-What's my problem?
-Yeah, what is your problem? I'm...

173
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,113
First of all, I'm gonna tell you
what my problem is.

174
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,650
You came in here and interrupted my story,
and that ain't cool.

175
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,048
My second problem is

176
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:50,349
I've been a Marcus Foster man
ever since this place was built.

177
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,721
And the first I hear
about them tearing it down is right now.

178
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,794
Oh, it ain't like I didn't see it coming.

179
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,989
But they could have gave me a heads up,
you know.

180
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,226
You get my point?
'Cause I am head of maintenance.

181
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,729
Yeah, you doing a hell of a job.

182
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,834
Look, where do I start, man?
Just tell me where I start.

183
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,374
Why don't you go ask the city?

184
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,978
They the one hired you.

185
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,714
Damn.

186
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,419
Look at this damn stuff.

187
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,164
God bless this space.

188
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,075
You sleeping here now?

189
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,978
Or it just happen to be part of your job?

190
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,554
No.

191
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,377
Elston.

192
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,151
Come on, Elston. I know you're in there.

193
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,701
You knew this was coming, Elston.

194
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,669
Not in three months, I didn't.

195
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,107
You couldn't even call me
and tell me yourself.

196
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,076
I had to find out
from the damn clean-up crew.

197
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,081
I'm sorry about that, Elston.
Things happen.

198
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,814
"Things happen." Yeah.

199
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,888
What happened to all those strings
you supposed to be pulling, Miss Sue?

200
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,548
You're my city representative.
Go down there and start representing.

201
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:16,253
Elston,
the city isn't gonna fund an institution

202
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,956
that has no economic worth to it
or the community it serves.

203
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,125
Let me tell you something, Sue.

204
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,796
Worth shouldn't be based on economics.

205
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,305
You of all people should know that.

206
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,238
Elston, how many kids
came through that front door today?

207
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,574
None.

208
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,809
How many yesterday?
Hell, the last six months?

209
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,044
Yes, I see them
playing basketball out front.

210
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,587
But you know what?
They can play basketball anywhere.

211
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,816
This place is a nesting ground

212
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,189
for drugs, thugs
and the lowest common denominator.

213
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,785
"Lowest common denominator."

214
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,593
Let me tell you something right now,
Miss Sue.

215
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,292
If it weren't for this place
keeping you off the street,

216
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,393
you wouldn't have no pretty threads
on your back right now.

217
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,405
So don't you ever forget that.

218
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,473
Elston, we are not gonna keep
this place open just for you.

219
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,944
Nice shot. Nice shot.

220
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,608
-Hot out here, like Vietnam.
-What do you know about Vietnam?

221
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,878
I know that's where you going
if you keep flunking English.

222
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,613
You know, they draft the dumb ones first,
right?

223
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,586
-I guess you might be next.
-No, 'cause you're dumb.

224
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,850
Pass the ball. Come on.

225
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,892
Look who's back.

226
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,585
See you still ain't found a iron.

227
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,061
See you haven't found no game yet.

228
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,862
Hey, hey. Look, look, look. Look.

229
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,481
Well, we running a shelter here?

230
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,404
Yeah, I didn't know
the city paid you to swim.

231
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,671
That must be a real nice gig.

232
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,540
Actually, they don't pay me much at all.

233
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,845
But I didn't know the city paid you
to be in my business.

234
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,477
Well, let me get the iron out
and iron this wrinkle out of you right now.

235
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,522
I'm gonna let you know something
straight off the press, baby.

236
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,454
Everything up in here is my business.

237
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,528
And better yet, when the water bill come,

238
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,358
I'll make sure you get part of my business.

239
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:50,333
Okay, and I'll make sure I don't pay it.

240
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,733
For some reason, I knew that already.

241
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,868
Hey, so Puddin, man,
Puddin say he waiting to get married.

242
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,774
He waiting to fall in love before he do it.

243
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.

244
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,407
'Cause sex and basketball
ain't the only thing on my mind.

245
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,314
There's more to life than sex.

246
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,855
Man, what you know about sex, man?
You never got yourself none.

247
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,890
-What?
-Shut up, Reg.

248
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,217
Yo, what... What the hell?

249
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,195
-Oh, man.
-Hey, man, what you doing?

250
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,657
What does it look like?
Taking down the rims.

251
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,065
Yeah, but why?

252
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,163
City's closing the place down.
I'm supposed to bring the rims in.

253
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:32,801
-Sorry, fellows.
-You ain't got to take it, man, just leave...

254
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,245
They always messing
with our neighborhood.

255
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,406
Man, what we supposed to do now?

256
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,882
Walk eight miles
and play over at the Hudson Center?

257
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,886
Man, in this heat?
You must be out your mind.

258
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,216
Hey, say, man,
what you gonna do with that rim?

259
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,451
Get off me. Man, this is bullshit!

260
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,485
What's he smiling at?

261
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,135
What? It's hot.

262
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,358
Y'all having fun?

263
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,395
You suck! You suck!

264
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,193
-Give me the ball.
-I got the ball.

265
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,000
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.

266
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,200
Listen up,
I need to talk to y'all for a second.

267
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,334
You with the basketball.

268
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,606
I got to tell you, first of all, I think

269
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,012
that was pretty low,
what they did to y'all outside,

270
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,710
pulling down your basketball rim.

271
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:24,255
But as long as this place is open,

272
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,722
I'm gonna let y'all swim in here.

273
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:27,951
But if y'all gonna be in here,

274
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,720
you gonna have to act
like you got some sense

275
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,661
'cause, I mean, theoretically,
ain't none of y'all supposed to be in here.

276
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:36,393
Yeah, neither is Puddin Head,
but his pop's condom broke.

277
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,197
Hey, man, watch the 'fro now, brother.
Watch the 'fro.

278
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,238
-What's your name?
-Hakim.

279
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,102
My name's Jim Ellis.

280
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,402
What does that sign say up on the wall?

281
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,579
"No

282
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,310
-"Clowns."
-Clowning.

283
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,352
-l-N-G.
-Shut up, Walt. Did he ask you?

284
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,820
-l-N-G is clowning.
-Look, this isn't a joke right now.

285
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:02,860
It says, "No clowning in or out of the pool."

286
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,327
Stay away from the deep end
if you can't swim.

287
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,489
What you say you do up here?

288
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:11,002
Who are you, the janitor?
What, you clean toilets?

289
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,502
Is that it, man? Can we go swimming now?

290
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,334
Yeah, we're straight.
Y'all understand, right?

291
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,839
Yes, we understand.

292
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,437
-Can we swim now?
-Okay.

293
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:28,015
And you, Mr. Smartass, over there.

294
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,546
-Name's Andre.
-Okay, Andre.

295
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,318
If you cup your hands
while you're swimming,

296
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,724
you swim a whole lot faster, son.

297
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,557
Just think about it.

298
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,555
I think I swim fast enough, janitor.

299
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,871
What was that?

300
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,031
You heard me.

301
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,132
You need to stick to
stacking boxes over there

302
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,234
and leave the swimming to the experts.

303
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,041
-Tell him, Dre.
-Yeah, yeah.

304
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,672
Expert? So you the expert now?

305
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,115
Expert at what, like running your mouth?

306
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,856
Say, man, I back up what I say.

307
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:11,390
20 bucks says
I dust your old ass off in a race.

308
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:22,162
My 50 to your 20 says, "Negro, please."

309
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,370
Hey, man, you about to get smoked, man.

310
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,377
We talking three months
of swimming rehab.

311
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,674
Janitor don't stand a chance, man.

312
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,642
You ready, old man?

313
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,821
-He got blue panties on.
-I told you he was a fruitcake, man.

314
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,797
-Fruitcake! Fruitcake!
-Look at this! Look at this!

315
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,665
Superhero.

316
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,907
-Captain Panties.
-Save me! Save me!

317
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,536
To the end and back.

318
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:01,876
Lead the way.

319
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,938
All right. On your mark.

320
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,950
Get set.

321
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,713
Go!

322
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,955
Yo, man, what you doing, man? It's a race.

323
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,152
-Not really.
-Go, man.

324
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,228
Go, go.

325
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,600
All right, come on, Dre. Come on, man.

326
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,602
All right, here we go.
You got him. You got him.

327
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,830
Look, y'all.

328
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,613
You got it! You got it!

329
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,153
Come on.

330
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,890
Come on.

331
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,165
Oh, man,
he got beat by Captain Panties.

332
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,636
You lost! You lost!

333
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,004
-Hey, all I know...
-Get out the pool.

334
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,771
-...is you got burnt.
-For real.

335
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,140
-Burnt! Burnt! Burnt!
-Just shut up.

336
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,611
I'll kick both your ugly asses.

337
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:13,150
-At what? At swimming?
-I can see you drowning, you going down.

338
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,019
Man, you... You were fierce in that water.

339
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,755
Could you hook me up
with some of those moves sometime?

340
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,884
-First learn how to swim.
-Hey, hey.

341
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,518
What the heck is going on here?

342
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,722
Jim, what you call yourself doing, man?

343
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,731
I'm just surviving, baby.

344
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:33,065
I guess we just in the place
we supposed to be right now.

345
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,002
-ls that right?
-Yeah.

346
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,564
Y'all be careful.
No clowning in and out the pool.

347
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,268
I'm watching.

348
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,506
Hey, Elston,
why don't you come and swim with us?

349
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,847
Jim, where I come from, we swim naked.

350
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,182
And I don't want to embarrass nobody.

351
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,290
-You owe me 20, daddy.
-Nice, man.

352
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,306
Dre-T, where you going, man?

353
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,509
Stick around, brother, have a beer.

354
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,114
Might even let you drive tonight,
like old times.

355
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,119
Remember all the fun we used to have?

356
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,389
Yeah, I remember.

357
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,167
I remember you leaving me for dead.

358
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,166
Is that how you remember it going down?

359
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:48,738
No, see, I remember you
taking them bullets like a man, for us.

360
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,646
Look, here.

361
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,678
I haven't forgot that, brother.

362
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,088
You smell that?

363
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,727
Come on, baby.

364
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,696
It's for you.

365
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,267
Swollen up on me.

366
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,506
All right, brother.

367
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,705
It's all right, young blood.

368
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,543
You know where to find me.

369
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:55,068
What you guys have to remember

370
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,670
is that each and every stroke

371
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,284
begins with an extension into the water.

372
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:06,790
You are reaching and stretching
as far as you can.

373
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,584
Now, I'm gonna show you.

374
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,427
Remember, you keep moving your legs.

375
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,364
Stretch out, reach as far as you can.

376
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,763
Try it.

377
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,375
One, two, breathe.

378
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,571
Now you're swimming
like a wounded animal.

379
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,672
One, two, breathe.

380
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,348
One, two, breathe.

381
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,253
Coach, why do these got to be here?
They keep messing me up.

382
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,918
The line is there to keep you
from messing everybody else up.

383
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,552
One, two, breathe.

384
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,893
If you breathe correctly, you don't drown.

385
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,466
Pull it back.

386
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:53,900
Reach out.

387
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:59,443
Make eye contact, pull them back again.

388
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:02,012
Walt, who told you
to take a board out there?

389
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,809
-But my hair.
-Get rid of the damn board.

390
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,041
What, you trying to drown us?

391
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,248
I'll show you fools.

392
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,790
Hey, Jim, let me show them how it's done.

393
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,421
Push.

394
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,022
Push.

395
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,424
Push.

396
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,727
You can make it, don't give up.

397
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,208
You can't run across the water.

398
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,739
Come on out here, young man.

399
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:43,952
Hey, Mr. Ellis,
you see how fast I was today?

400
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:47,616
Yeah, Reggie, you were smoking, man.
I think you broke a record.

401
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:53,021
Hey, don't some of those
rec centers have...

402
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,491
Have like swimming teams?

403
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,365
Like... Like...

404
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,295
Swimming tournaments and stuff.

405
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,533
You mean like meets? Swim meets?

406
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,772
Yeah, I suppose they would,
especially the ones that got pools.

407
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:09,971
Why?

408
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,981
I'm saying...

409
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,246
We swimming like every day, you know.

410
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,548
Maybe we should get in some.

411
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:21,955
-Hey, mister. Are there girls at these meets?
-Yeah.

412
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,325
That must be why they call them meets.
You meet girls.

413
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:30,993
Hey, we could be
splish-splashing with some girls.

414
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,772
Yeah, I think we really should.

415
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,365
Look, fellows. Look, what we do here,

416
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,510
I mean, this is all fun and games.

417
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:47,516
You talking about leagues,
and these people, they take this serious.

418
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:51,145
Dig, man. I'm tired of racing these jokers.

419
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,983
I need some more janitors to go up against.

420
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,323
-Why? So you can get smoked again?
-And again.

421
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,895
And again.

422
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,226
Yeah, why don't y'all
finish getting dressed?

423
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,823
But I really think we're ready.

424
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,755
Hey, foxy.

425
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,957
-Say, baby doll.
-Yeah, my name is Walt.

426
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,460
What's your name?

427
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,563
Victoria, huh?

428
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:39,528
-Let me walk you on down the street.
-We on the swim team.

429
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,369
See, I know how to do the breaststroke.

430
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,339
-Girl, I'm just saying, look...
-Reggie.

431
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,382
Hey, baby boy, how you doing?

432
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,883
You want some of this candy
to go along with your groceries?

433
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,319
You need a new trick.

434
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,392
-Does she fetch, too?
-A little bit of everything, brother.

435
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,462
I'm just trying to hook you up, man.
Make a little peace offering.

436
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:09,226
-The brother loves the peace.
-I'm with you, man. I feel that.

437
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,767
You sure? I got your back, man.

438
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,262
Oh, it's like that?

439
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,398
It's like that, baby boy? It's all right, baby.

440
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,533
I ain't going nowhere.
You gonna learn to love me.

441
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,939
Here you go, Jim.

442
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,546
What's that?

443
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:33,181
All the city parks and recreational sports
schedule, right there.

444
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,984
Why do I need this?

445
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,254
I might start a lacrosse team or something.

446
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,592
Brothers around here don't lacrosse.

447
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,136
Brothers don't swim, neither.

448
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,236
Hakim!

449
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,131
Hakim!

450
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:28,638
Hakim!

451
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,411
-What?
-Come on.

452
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,348
It's past your curfew, boy.

453
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,255
Hey, shut up!

454
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,552
Hi.

455
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,289
You're about to get very embarrassed.

456
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,297
Can't you see me hanging with the guys?

457
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,866
Get in the car.

458
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,705
Out of the pool.
Come on, let's go. Right now.

459
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,937
Let's go, line up here.
Act like you got some sense.

460
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,310
-What did we do?
-Come on, you get right there.

461
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:07,316
Come on! Come on. There you go, Jim.

462
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,513
I wanna talk to you guys about something.

463
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,349
Do y'all remember the first gift
that you was given

464
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,949
after you made it into this world?

465
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,426
What was it?

466
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,098
-Your name?
-Your name.

467
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:27,102
What's the last thing that's remembered
about you when you leave this world?

468
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,070
-Your name?
-Your name.

469
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,840
-Where's Hakim?
-Man, that fool's on restriction.

470
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,912
Yeah, his sister's crazy, man.

471
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:39,312
I'm telling you, man,
she's all about the books and stuff.

472
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:40,645
Yeah.

473
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,117
Well, take a good look at each other.

474
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,957
-Mr. Taylor, right?
-Yeah.

475
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,461
Mr. Williamson,

476
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,295
Mr. Davis and Mr. Jones.

477
00:38:56,534 --> 00:39:00,334
You are now the official representatives

478
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,771
of the Marcus Foster Recreational Center.

479
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:06,866
-What you talking about?
-You guys asked for a meet, right?

480
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:10,743
Well, you got it.
This weekend against Main Line Academy.

481
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,282
You are now an official team.

482
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,954
We're a team, man,
we gonna be stroking.

483
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:25,652
-I'll be stroking on.
-Right on, brother.

484
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,988
-Yeah.
-Right on.

485
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,895
All right, I guess we a team.

486
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,475
How you doing?

487
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:06,064
Hello, my name's Jim Ellis.
I work down at the Foster's Rec.

488
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,733
-Foster's?
-Yes.

489
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,110
-ls Hakim home?
-Can I help you?

490
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:18,372
See, I'm coaching the boys down there.

491
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,746
We've started a little swim team.
I wanted to know if...

492
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:24,116
If Hakim would like to be a part of it.

493
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,756
-Swim team at Foster's?
-Yes.

494
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,128
We're closing that place down.

495
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,254
What do you mean, we?

496
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,629
We, meaning the city, me.

497
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,370
I'm Councilwoman Sue Carter,
Hakim's sister.

498
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,564
Well, is Hakim's parents home?

499
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:47,275
-I'm his legal guardian. You can talk to me.
-Okay.

500
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,142
Some of the kids kind of took to swimming.

501
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:53,375
And just Hakim
has shown so much promise.

502
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:56,920
So much promise and
I would love for him to continue with that.

503
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,948
And then what happens?
Do they get swim scholarships?

504
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:04,653
-Do they become professional swimmers?
-No, probably not.

505
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,787
Definitely not.

506
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:12,368
Miss Carter, do you swim, by chance?

507
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,636
-Do I swim?
-Yes, ma'am.

508
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:24,173
Mr. Ellis, Hakim missed three weeks of
school when he was with your swim team.

509
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,212
-I'm sorry, I didn't know that.
-Yeah.

510
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,752
I don't want my brother
back out on the street, okay?

511
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,881
So the best thing you can do for these kids
is encourage them to get a good education,

512
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,824
pack up that rec center and shut it down.

513
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,589
Well, Miss Carter, do you mind
if I have a word with him then?

514
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,891
Please.

515
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,964
Man, you got some really great books here.

516
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,138
You must love to read.

517
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,879
No, I ain't never read none of them.

518
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,243
Really?

519
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,145
"But the sister said, 'That is the pain."'

520
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,724
Looks like you could use some help,
young man.

521
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,624
Okay?

522
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:19,225
You serious?

523
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,272
One-zero.

524
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,271
All right.

525
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,712
-What y'all doing?
-Studying swimming.

526
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:37,309
Wait a minute,
y'all got two days before a Main Line event

527
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,389
and you sitting here, sitting on your ass?

528
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,323
I think Main Line's
got a meet with us in two days.

529
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,859
You know, pride is before crash.

530
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,333
Come on, man, you're a team now.
Get up, get up.

531
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:51,867
Get in the pool.

532
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,531
Excuse me. How you doing, young lady?
Can I help you with something?

533
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,632
-Yes, I'm here to swim.
-Coach, we got us a swimmer here.

534
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,576
Hi, I'm Wilhelmina Thompson.
My friends call me Willie.

535
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,874
I'm Jim Ellis.

536
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:08,816
But unfortunately, young lady,
we don't have a girl's team here.

537
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,821
Well, from the looks of it, you don't have
much of a guy's team, either.

538
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,525
-You feisty.
-I like her.

539
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,685
-Show us what you got.
-All right.

540
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,386
Excuse me, girl.

541
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,988
You know, you got a bright future with you.

542
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:47,986
Guess she on the team, huh?

543
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:02,462
Come on, man. Hey, look at
your mamma over there, walking.

544
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,473
Is that your mamma, covered in dirt?

545
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:08,102
What's up, brother?
We're going to swim. We're going to swim.

546
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:59,190
Hey, Coach, man, this place make
Marcus Foster look like a damn outhouse.

547
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,389
Boy, no need for all that.

548
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:04,990
What we're gonna try and do today
is go in there and swim like a team.

549
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,935
Because it's not where you swim,
it's how you swim.

550
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,232
And if we act like a team,

551
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,706
we might come out of here today
with some type of decent placement. So...

552
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,107
Might?

553
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,111
There ain't no might about it.

554
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:19,704
I say we go on up in here,
kick their white asses,

555
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:24,117
eat their little caviar and roll back
to the ghetto with a win. You dig?

556
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,121
Dre know what he's talking about.

557
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,817
No need to be so damn cocky,
this is your first meet.

558
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,416
We don't need to worry
about these white boys at all.

559
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,495
Cocky, man. We're just good.

560
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,325
You're that good? Okay.

561
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,230
Come here.
I'm not done talking to y'all. Listen up.

562
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,963
What we're gonna do,
we're gonna go inside the locker room,

563
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,972
-we're gonna put on the swim gear.
-Swim gear? Coach,

564
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,968
I got my shorts on under my pants.

565
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:48,974
-Me, too.
-No, you're not prepared.

566
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,014
Today, we're gonna wear the real thing.
Elston.

567
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,907
What you talking about?

568
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,552
One size fit all.

569
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,587
-No, hell no.
-I'm not wearing that.

570
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,247
That ain't funny. What you laughing at?

571
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:02,552
What do you mean, hell no?
This is a swim meet.

572
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,524
This isn't some backyard function.

573
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:07,654
This is proper swimming attire.

574
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,928
-This is your uniform.
-That's not my uniform.

575
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:14,435
Elston. Elston, come on now.
I can't even get my boys in those.

576
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:16,529
Trust me, you and your boys
will be just fine.

577
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,800
Look, I don't care what y'all say,

578
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:21,207
I don't got to wear no blue panties to go
in there and kick them white boys' asses.

579
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,608
Me, neither.

580
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,144
You're supposed to be a team.

581
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,342
A team wears the same thing.

582
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,284
I mean, if Willie wear them, then...
She wear them?

583
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,957
Oh, my goodness, man.

584
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,397
Please leave the preparation area.

585
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:45,867
Only registered swimmers of the teams
remain in the starting...

586
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,831
Man, what's all these people
looking at us like this for?

587
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:54,635
-Dyn-o-mite.
-I didn't know they swam.

588
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,440
Must be some kind of a protest march.

589
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:03,716
Come on, Reg. Just ignore them, man.

590
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,654
What the hell? Can you believe this?
They're not even dressed right.

591
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:09,487
-It's free dress today.
-Come on, no let down today.

592
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:12,585
We've got 56 consecutive home victories.

593
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,494
That's right, 56 straight.

594
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,296
It's impressive.
Some people can't even count that high.

595
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:22,895
No let down, boys, not today.
Let's go, Main Line.

596
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:26,776
Richard Binkowski,
around the sports world

597
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:28,970
-they know me as the Bink.
-We've met before.

598
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,808
-We have?
-Yes, we have.

599
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,348
-This is Mr. Johnson.
-Meet a lot of people.

600
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,111
Yeah, yeah, nice to see you.

601
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:38,620
-You have a girl on your team?
-Yes.

602
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:42,317
And you realize this is a boys' swim meet.
No girls allowed here.

603
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,450
Where does it say that?

604
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,425
We missed the sign
when we walked in here?

605
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,396
Better yet, you got a
rules and regulations book on you?

606
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,331
-Are you her lawyer?
-Yeah, you can say I'm her mouthpiece.

607
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:52,732
-You want to go to court?
-Yeah.

608
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:54,201
Bet you know your way
around the courtroom.

609
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,669
-I was born there.
-Yeah. Yeah.

610
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:57,467
-Well, enjoy your freedom while you can.
-Yeah.

611
00:47:57,574 --> 00:48:01,203
Yeah, well, listen,
just so you understand the format today,

612
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:04,712
'cause it's complicated.
We start off with a 50 breast,

613
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:09,047
-and then we go to the...
-I know the format, Mr. Binkowski.

614
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,380
-You do know the format?
-Yes.

615
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,216
-You understand it?
-I understand it.

616
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:15,223
Okay, because I'm here to help you
if you need anything.

617
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:18,920
Any questions that you need answered,
you talk to the Bink, okay?

618
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,122
-Thank you so much.
-You bet.

619
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,327
-Pompous ass, huh?
-All right, men, come on.

620
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,665
That's what I'm saying.
This is what we deal with.

621
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:28,999
Come on.

622
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:30,530
Stay focused.

623
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:34,771
Welcome to the
Main Line Academy Swim Meet.

624
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:38,075
Home of the current regional champion,

625
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:40,672
the Main Line Barracudas.

626
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,411
-You got this.
-You got to be kidding me.

627
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,950
You got a problem with me
and my swim team, man?

628
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,893
You mean,
you guys aren't the Harlem Globetrotters?

629
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,159
-No.
-That's cute.

630
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,995
-That's real cute.
-Mr. Davis, focus.

631
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:01,204
Will the swimmers involved
in the 50-yard breaststroke

632
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:05,435
-please approach the starting blocks.
-Mr. Davis, get us off to a good start.

633
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:07,242
All right, go.

634
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,153
Put your hand out. Reach out.

635
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:30,365
Let's go!

636
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,335
Give it, Miss Thompson.

637
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,602
Come on. Make your turn, come on.

638
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,170
Come on.

639
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:57,985
Keep your focus, find the center.

640
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,474
Come on!

641
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:23,185
Cheer for him!

642
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,523
He hit his head...

643
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,822
Swimmers, take your mark.

644
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,143
Get your pants back on.

645
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,879
Keep going.

646
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:57,650
Blast off!

647
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,495
Hey, you stand there
with your thumb up your ass?

648
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,329
What kind of bullshit circus
are you running here?

649
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,494
I'll take care of it.

650
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:16,504
Coach, keep your boys in line.

651
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,130
I'm sorry.

652
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,072
I apologize.

653
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:22,638
Come on.

654
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,049
I'm tired of embarrassing myself,
let's get out of here.

655
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:27,741
Come on, you guys.

656
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,052
We can't, Coach, we...

657
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,620
We got one more.

658
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:34,986
And now, the last race of the day,
the 50-yard freestyle.

659
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:39,722
Well, just be glad they took off the cuffs
so you could swim, brother.

660
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,267
Swimmers, take your mark.

661
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,131
Hey! Come on!

662
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,047
Go, Mr. Williamson.

663
00:51:58,515 --> 00:51:59,914
Make your turn.

664
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,119
He fouled!

665
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,024
Wait, wait, wait!
He just kicked him in the head.

666
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,151
-Coach, I didn't see anything.
-No, no. He just kicked him in the head.

667
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,990
-That's a disqualification.
-No, sir.

668
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:14,893
That's a foul! Did you see that?

669
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:16,863
-You guys saw it, didn't you?
-I didn't see a thing.

670
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,026
No, sir. Not a foul. Sorry.

671
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,132
Yeah, it figures you'd complain
about something.

672
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:23,263
Yes, yes!

673
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:25,398
Fifty-seven in a row. Come on!

674
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,067
Fifty-seven.

675
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,441
We made it, five, seven.

676
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:30,937
Once again...

677
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,675
