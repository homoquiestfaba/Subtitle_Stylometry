1
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,946
(film reel whirring)

2
00:00:06,947 --> 00:00:09,614
(ambient music)

3
00:00:12,115 --> 00:00:14,448
(dog barks)

4
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,169
(tone beeps)

5
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,196
Hey everyone, it's Wes Wheatley here,

6
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:47,859
and we're on location at Sarah

7
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,830
and Ian's residence,

8
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:50,979
where evidently, nightly,

9
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,679
Sarah has been rising out of bed

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,159
and wandering around the house

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,549
with no knowledge of having done it.

12
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,099
And Ian is afraid

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,349
that his wife might be
possessed by a demon.

14
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,409
We're here at the house right now

15
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,009
to investigate, to find out,

16
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,499
if Ian's concerns are valid.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,069
Let's go meet the couple.

18
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,070
Come on.

19
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,739
(door knocking)

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,033
This is Ian and Sarah.

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,933
Ian, hi.

22
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:16,933
Hey.

23
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,010
- Wes.
- Wes.

24
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:19,940
- Good to meet ya.
- Yeah, yeah, man.

25
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:21,099
Glad you're here.

26
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,933
All right, let's go.

27
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,629
- You ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,789
We're here in Ian and Sarah's living room,

29
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,009
where Sarah has agreed

30
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,979
to allow us to perform a deliverance,

31
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,059
otherwise known as an exorcism.

32
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,073
I have a book of demonology here,

33
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,080
just in case,

34
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:38,639
depending on the spirit
that has possessed Sarah.

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,709
When it comes forward,

36
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,439
we'll see if we need this book.

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
Sarah,

38
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,999
the way that an exorcism works

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,639
is not like, you might be accustomed

40
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,473
to seeing in the movies.

41
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:49,569
I don't know if you watch horror movies,

42
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,029
but it's nothing like that.

43
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,329
Usually, it's actually a very subtle,

44
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,669
a release in the shoulders

45
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,889
with tingling on the back of the neck.

46
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,839
So, what I want you to do

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,489
is that I want you to pay close attention

48
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,459
to how you're feeling in your body.

49
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,389
Demon, in the name of Jesus Christ,

50
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,413
I command you,

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,393
surface now.

52
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,290
Shh. Sit still.

53
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,123
Look at me.

54
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:13,899
Demon, in the name of Jesus,

55
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,133
I command you to show yourself, now.

56
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,599
Look in my eyes Sarah.

57
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,106
Demon, I am talking to you.

58
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:23,709
[Ian] Oh, God.

59
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,389
In the name of God,

60
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,179
I command you

61
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,683
to show yourself, now.

62
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,480
Demon, in Jesus' name...

63
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:39,289
Do you wanna kill her like
you killed the other one?

64
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,461
- [Man] Randy, you got the...
- Do you want to kill her

65
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:41,373
like you killed the other one?

66
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:42,206
Is that what you want

67
00:02:42,207 --> 00:02:43,797
Randy, grab her! Hold her down!

68
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:44,904
Demon!
- Is that what you want?

69
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:46,362
- Demon, I command you...
- Do you want to kill her

70
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:47,453
like you killed the other one?

71
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:48,821
Is that what you want?
- To leave this vessel now!

72
00:02:48,822 --> 00:02:49,655
Wes?

73
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:50,488
- Demon...
- Is that what you want?

74
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:52,153
I command you...
- Sarah!

75
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:53,888
- To leave this vessel now!
- Is that what you want?

76
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:57,277
(demon snarling)

77
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,618
Demon!

78
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:00,393
In the name of God,

79
00:03:00,394 --> 00:03:01,584
I command you,

80
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:03,615
to leave this vessel now!

81
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,146
(demon roaring)

82
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:08,264
Demon, in the name of God,

83
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:09,479
I command you,

84
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,963
to leave this vessel now!

85
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,216
Demon!

86
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:16,241
In the name of God,

87
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:20,270
I command you to leave this vessel, now!

88
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:21,767
(static ceases)

89
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,768
(breathing heavily)

90
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:33,227
Back up, back up, back up.

91
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:35,206
[Ian] What the fuck? Is she okay?

92
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:36,863
Shh.

93
00:03:36,864 --> 00:03:38,531
God, come on, Sarah.

94
00:03:39,863 --> 00:03:41,915
(Wes breathing heavily)

95
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,260
(Sarah gasps)

96
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:47,594
(Wes breathing heavily)

97
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,960
It's okay.

98
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
You did great.

99
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,810
Okay?

100
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,643
Okay.

101
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:55,490
You're gonna stop
having those bad dreams.

102
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,929
How you doing?

103
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,763
Good. Good. Hey.

104
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:15,763
Hey, guys.

105
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,699
What you just saw was a
successful deliverance,

106
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,209
what most people refer to as exorcisms.

107
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,589
That was Sarah and her husband Ian.

108
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,899
Sarah was possessed by a demon,

109
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,599
but we successfully exorcized the demon,

110
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,609
and, I think that she's
gonna be sleeping well

111
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,879
from now on.

112
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,303
So, great job, everybody.

113
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,773
(window bangs)

114
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,699
(Jane gasps)
- Oh, God.

115
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,533
Jane?

116
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:12,366
Yeah. Geoff?

117
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:13,199
- Yeah.
- Hi.

118
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,032
Here you go.

119
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:14,865
Back door's open.

120
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,399
Just, if you meet anybody,

121
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,039
don't tell 'em you got the keys from me.

122
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,496
Just you're on a night walk, okay?

123
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:20,330
Okay.

124
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,163
Keep it quick.

125
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:21,996
Be back here in an hour.

126
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:22,829
- Got it.
- Okay.

127
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:23,662
- See you in an hour.
- Okay, Jane.

128
00:05:23,662 --> 00:05:24,662
Thanks, Geoff.

129
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,669
(keys jingle)

130
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,503
All right, everybody.

131
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:33,799
We are here,

132
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
finally.

133
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,633
I think a lot of you know

134
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:38,466
that I have been trying

135
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,409
to get access to this building

136
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,939
for a really long time.

137
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,373
So, this is a pretty big deal.

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,399
All right, we are here.

139
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,899
We have the keys,

140
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,963
and we are entering in through
the side of the school.

141
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:58,037
Here we go.

142
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,943
We are in.

143
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,309
It's chilly in here.

144
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,633
The second floor.

145
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,413
Amazing to finally see what
this looks like on the inside.

146
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,869
Okay. We are inside

147
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,689
on the first floor.

148
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,619
My goal is to plant a camera on this floor

149
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,389
and then another one upstairs,

150
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,290
and I'll come back and get them later.

151
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,579
Okay, so now we are going to find a spot

152
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,653
to plant this first camera.

153
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,260
This looks like...

154
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:40,261
Let's see.

155
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,989
Oh, this looks like the front door,

156
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,550
so I bet if we place the camera

157
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,543
somewhere in view.

158
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,993
Oh, that little spot might work actually.

159
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,340
Let's see.

160
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:07,446
Okay.

161
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,983
Okay, there is our first hidden camera.

162
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,553
We are now just heading
into the old admin office.

163
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,929
Oh, here's the names
of some of the teachers

164
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,080
that used to work here.

165
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,219
There's a little, tiny door over here

166
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,586
with some really messed up carpet.

167
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:12,337
(carpet peeling)

168
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,890
(knocks on door)

169
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:40,430
(knocking on door)

170
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:43,519
(Jane gasps)

171
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,219
I'm just fucking with you.
(chuckles)

172
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,809
So, we will go up here

173
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,479
to do what I've been really excited to do;

174
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,023
check out the second floor.

175
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,773
All right.

176
00:08:55,774 --> 00:08:59,709
So, now we will find a
place to put the camera,

177
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,713
the second camera.

178
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,099
We have two stairwells.

179
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,173
So, 50-50 shot of where we wanna aim it.

180
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,519
I don't think putting it
under the water fountain

181
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,933
will work very well up here.

182
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,340
This will actually probably work fine.

183
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,433
So, turn it on.

184
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:23,069
Okay.

185
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:31,034
Okay.

186
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,130
There we go.

187
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,790
Yeah, looks pretty good.

188
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,873
Whoa!

189
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,249
It looks like everyone
in Sacramento is asleep.

190
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,979
Hopefully, if anyone's
looking in right now,

191
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,503
they don't think I'm a ghost.

192
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,989
Okay, now we'll go check out the basement,

193
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,039
which I think it's just a
bunch of dirt and chairs,

194
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,270
but we'll see what we can find.

195
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:17,688
(door bangs)

196
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,900
Geoff?

197
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,920
This door was open when
I was in here last.

198
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:53,921
(locker door bangs)

199
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:57,930
Geoff?

200
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:03,175
Hello!

201
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:14,034
I think, there's somebody
in here right now.

202
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:56,987
(locker door clunks)

203
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,273
So, not exactly sure
what that sound was, but

204
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:27,402
I think I need to get the
fuck out of here, because...

205
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:29,820
(door bangs)

206
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Hello?

207
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:37,331
(loud bang)

208
00:12:42,698 --> 00:12:45,615
(static crackling)

209
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:50,561
(footsteps approaching)

210
00:13:10,754 --> 00:13:12,465
Yep, rolling.

211
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:16,329
(Randy knocking door)

212
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,483
Hi, Isabel?
- Hello.

213
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,270
[Isabel] Yeah. Randy?

214
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:20,889
- Yes.
- [Isabel] Nice to meet you.

215
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,379
So, like I mentioned before,

216
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,327
we have a camera crew.

217
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:25,296
Oh.

218
00:13:25,296 --> 00:13:26,151
Oh! (chuckles)

219
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:26,984
Hello.
- This is Rob.

220
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:27,817
- Hey.
- Our camera guy.

221
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:28,650
- Hi, Rob.
- And this is Austin,

222
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:29,699
our sound guy.

223
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,886
Are we filming?

224
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:32,569
- We are.
- Oh.

225
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,239
Okay.
(chuckles nervously)

226
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Come on in.

227
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,810
[Austin] There. You're all set.

228
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,680
Okay.

229
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:45,659
I don't normally deal with demons

230
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,933
or kind of the darker side of things.

231
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,749
It's more, you know I
help people reconnect

232
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,949
with their loved ones

233
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,369
who have passed on, stuff like that.

234
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,959
I do believe in the kind of darker side

235
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,693
and that there are darker spirits.

236
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,469
But not to the level

237
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,704
that Wes seems

238
00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:08,629
to be involved.

239
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,259
I think, you have to tread lightly,

240
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,500
especially with...

241
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,459
You know, if you're
working on darker stuff.

242
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,150
And I think that...

243
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,263
That's all

244
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:24,809
I'll say about that.
(chuckles)

245
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,319
[Randy] Okay, you seem a bit...

246
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,549
I don't wanna be rude.

247
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,239
Obviously, we're not gonna put this

248
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,919
in the film

249
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,399
or wherever he wants to do it.

250
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,208
You seem a bit reserved.

251
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,579
I just...

252
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,413
You know, obviously,

253
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:38,966
I know I'm being recorded

254
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:42,583
and I know that you're
doing this with Wes.

255
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,879
So, I'm just trying to be
a little bit more judicious

256
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,169
about what I'm saying.

257
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,759
Are you gonna show him all
of the stuff that I say?

258
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,677
[Randy] Probably not.

259
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,009
I think Wes has a
different style than I do.

260
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,259
And I think,

261
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,083
it can be misused.

262
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,509
So, Wes doesn't know you're here?

263
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,510
[Randy] No.

264
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,009
Don't worry, he's not gonna know

265
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,459
that we're filming this.

266
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,023
As I said, this is just for us.

267
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,130
We're just curious.

268
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:19,939
So, you're not gonna
use this in the show?

269
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,023
[Randy] No.

270
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,450
Well, then

271
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,629
why are you filming it?

272
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,780
[Randy] For research.

273
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,403
'Cause as a producer,

274
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:32,419
I need to know more about him as a person,

275
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,809
because, you know these kinds of shows,

276
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,369
they have a personality,

277
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,709
and we're tryna humanize him more,

278
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,209
because he just seems very over-the-top.

279
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,379
And there's a lot of
stuff like that out there.

280
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,419
So, we wanna bring more to his character.

281
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,209
If we know more about
him, that's gonna help.

282
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,469
Do you talk to him still?

283
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,520
When was the last time you talked to him?

284
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:56,912
It was a couple of years ago.

285
00:15:56,913 --> 00:15:57,746
A couple of years ago,

286
00:15:57,747 --> 00:15:59,590
I had to call him about a health thing

287
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,969
relating to our mom,

288
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,599
but other than that,

289
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,779
I mean, we kind of had
a little falling out,

290
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,879
and so we haven't really talked.

291
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,380
[Randy] Do you do exorcisms?

292
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
No.

293
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
[Randy] Does he?

294
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,859
He has been known to do exorcisms.

295
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,179
That was actually part of
the contributing factor

296
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,843
to our falling out.

297
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
When was this?

298
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:37,339
[Randy] Three days ago.

299
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,340
Oh.

300
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,820
Did it...

301
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
What happened?

302
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,239
I mean, I don't wanna go into any details,

303
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,789
but that...

304
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,239
You know, the reason we're not talking

305
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,543
is all of this stuff.

306
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,006
So, this is some footage

307
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:56,129
that somebody sent to me.

308
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,899
This is the typical kind of thing I get

309
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,489
where somebody wants me to analyze some...

310
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,519
This is some security footage.

311
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,229
You can see the door closing by itself.

312
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,229
My job when I'm reviewing
something like this

313
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,773
is to see, first of all,

314
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:13,339
if there is a practical
explanation for this.

315
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,409
Most people, something spooks them,

316
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,349
and their mind immediately
zips to something paranormal.

317
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,039
And I know, that most of the time...

318
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,969
You can see actually here,
there's a spirit orb,

319
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,519
and the stool gets knocked over.

320
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,729
But I have to look at this and go,

321
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,269
okay, are there open windows around?

322
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,679
Is there a reason that the door
would have closed by itself?

323
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,939
Like, is there an AC unit

324
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,329
that comes on in the night?

325
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,829
And then after I look at the video

326
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,869
and I can see,

327
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,179
oh, actually there's legit reason

328
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,709
to think

329
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,469
that maybe there's something
spiritual happening here,

330
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,029
that's when I go and investigate.

331
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,033
Did you see the orb?

332
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,973
This is my, I call it the spirit satchel.

333
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,940
Take this with me.

334
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,673
I've got a book of demonology here.

335
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,739
All demons are spirits,
not all spirits are demons.

336
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,829
These are the devices that I've...

337
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,233
This is my haunting kit.

338
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,399
We've got an EMF meter here.

339
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,589
This is a spirit box

340
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,349
that scans through radio frequencies.

341
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,489
This is a recorder

342
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,209
that anybody could pick up,

343
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,819
although I've modified it a little bit

344
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,633
to hear higher frequencies.

345
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,489
And this is a,

346
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,269
just a regular camera,

347
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,629
although this does have
an infrared setting,

348
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,749
which is very important,

349
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,759
because that allows
you to see in the dark.

350
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,559
Does your camera have an
infrared setting by the way?

351
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,393
[Rob] Yeah, it does.

352
00:18:37,393 --> 00:18:38,340
It does.

353
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,173
[Rob] Yeah. Do you want to see it?

354
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:40,269
- Yeah.
- [Rob] yeah! Cool.

355
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,120
[Rob] So, it's the green type.

356
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,419
It doesn't have the white type.

357
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,260
[Wes] Yeah!

358
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,093
- [Rob] Hi, Randy.
- Hi.

359
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:45,322
[Wes] I know it doesn't look red,

360
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:46,519
it looks green,

361
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,519
but that is infrared.

362
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,659
Allows you to see in the dark.

363
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,339
A lot of ghost hunters use
these, which they should.

364
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,019
However, what I think that they get wrong

365
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,599
is most ghost hunters get
excited just when they get a hit.

366
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,369
But the reality is that
there are lots of things

367
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,623
that emit electromagnetic frequency.

368
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,369
So, getting a hit itself

369
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,109
isn't the thing that's exciting.

370
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,399
To me, what you're looking for

371
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,289
is something that is disrupting
the electromagnetic field

372
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,479
that is present.

373
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,199
This is a transmitter, right?

374
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,409
- [Austin] Yeah.
- Does this...

375
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,461
Here, let's see.

376
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:23,499
(transmitter beeping)

377
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,219
So, you can see right there

378
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,056
that a lot of people would go,

379
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:30,919
"Oh my God, there's a
ghost in your sound pack!"

380
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,559
Obviously, that's not the case.

381
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,635
What this does is...

382
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:36,811
(radio static crackling)

383
00:19:36,812 --> 00:19:39,709
This just picks up radio frequencies.

384
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,790
So, what you do...

385
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,739
is you let it cycle through
the radio frequencies,

386
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,699
and you'll notice you'll
pick up legit radio stations,

387
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,879
things that you know,

388
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,019
or DJs playing music, talk shows.

389
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,059
But to me, this is an opportunity

390
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,819
for spirits to actually
try to make contact with us

391
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,709
through this device.

392
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,660
Hey, everyone.

393
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,520
Wes Wheatley here.

394
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:05,349
Welcome to the first
episode of "Infrared".

395
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,859
This is a paranormal investigation show,

396
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,399
and right now we are on our way

397
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,879
to investigate the paranormal activities

398
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,919
that are taking place at
Jay and Nicole's residence.

399
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,109
They've been experiencing
what sounds to me

400
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,759
like an average haunt.

401
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,909
I think, that the spirits
don't mean them any harm,

402
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,009
but they themselves

403
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,149
are feeling very, very
frightened right now,

404
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,699
and we're gonna do a spiritual cleansing

405
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,149
so that we can release the spirits

406
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,769
from their residence

407
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,193
and let them get back to
feeling safe and secure.

408
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,220
Okay.

409
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,360
Here we are.

410
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,499
We are at Jay and Nicole's
residence right now.

411
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,333
We're gonna be going in.

412
00:20:39,334 --> 00:20:42,119
We're gonna do a spiritual
cleansing of the space,

413
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,449
release the haunt,

414
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,929
and let them get on with their lives.

415
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,149
So, let's do it.

416
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,553
[Randy] They know we're filming?

417
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,086
Uh...

418
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:52,799
Yeah.

419
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,369
Of course.

420
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,229
So, I'm just gonna go in there

421
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,869
and have a quick little pow-wow with them

422
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,549
to let them know what to expect,

423
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,959
and then we can all go in

424
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,419
and film this first haunt.

425
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,253
[Rob] I'll come with you.

426
00:21:07,253 --> 00:21:08,086
No, no, no. That's okay.

427
00:21:08,087 --> 00:21:09,687
It's all right. I'll just be right back.

428
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:15,615
(doorbell rings)

429
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,553
Hey, how's it going?

430
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:19,559
Jay. Hey man.

431
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,860
Good to meet you. I'm Wes.

432
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,649
All right, let's get this place cleansed.

433
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,709
We'll get you and your wife feeling good.

434
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,519
I've got a camera crew
here with me, actually,

435
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,215
that's gonna be filming the...

436
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:33,049
No.

437
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,429
- The cleansing.
- No, no, no.

438
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,430
We're not doing that.

439
00:21:35,431 --> 00:21:37,048
We're not doing cameras.

440
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:38,349
We didn't agree to that.

441
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,419
Little miscommunication.
(chuckles)

442
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,143
So, when I spoke to them earlier,

443
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,513
they thought it was next week.

444
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,129
Are you guys familiar with this?

445
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,673
This is Lincoln School.

446
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,129
This place gets talked about a lot.

447
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,299
A lot of people who have
tried to get into the space.

448
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,343
A lot of people who've tried
to sneak onto the grounds,

449
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,829
and cops are called,

450
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,419
and they're usually taken out.

451
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,809
Nobody's really been able to...

452
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:15,383
that I know of anyway, really infiltrate.

453
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,202
Is this good?
(laughs)

454
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:20,100
What do you think?
(crew chattering)

455
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:21,439
Okay.
(chuckles)

456
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,649
[Randy] Do you actually
believe in this kind of stuff?

457
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,669
Yeah, I do, very much.

458
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,660
[Randy] Really?

459
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:27,801
Yeah.

460
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:29,359
[Rob] Did you always?

461
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,829
I didn't when I was a kid.

462
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,663
Actually, it's funny.

463
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:33,719
When I was a kid, I grew up
in a very religious house.

464
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,993
I believed the idea of,

465
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,979
like something, I believed in, God,

466
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,429
and I believed in something different.

467
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,409
[Randy] Is your sister
religious as well?

468
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,489
Yeah.

469
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,779
I don't really wanna talk about my sister

470
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,259
in this, though.

471
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,436
[Randy] Why not?

472
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,209
'Cause she's not a part of it.

473
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,079
We don't really have,

474
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,439
you know, we don't work together anymore.

475
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,649
So, she's not a part of this show.

476
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,319
I'd rather just not have her be included.

477
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,389
So, there's a lot of different
rumors about, you know,

478
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,899
like why this school closed
down in the first place.

479
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,949
You can imagine 12 years

480
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,329
having been shut down,

481
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,483
you hear a lot of different stuff.

482
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,540
I think, the most popular rumor is that

483
00:23:22,323 --> 00:23:23,156
a teacher,

484
00:23:23,157 --> 00:23:25,020
I think, it was a seventh grade teacher,

485
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,823
went crazy.

486
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,459
Nobody really defined what crazy meant,

487
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,729
but went crazy

488
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,519
and like, murdered a
classroom of students.

489
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,939
An infestation of demon rats.

490
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,589
This was something I read on Facebook,

491
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,239
I think, like three years ago.

492
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,399
[Randy] So, do you
know why actually closed?

493
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,300
I do, yeah.

494
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:47,179
It's not quite as
exciting as demonic rats,

495
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,199
but what actually happened is that

496
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,609
there was a gas leak in a classroom,

497
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,539
and a teacher and five students died.

498
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,059
Since then, it's been totally shut down.

499
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,099
Nobody's been allowed on the premises.

500
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,809
And as far as I know,

501
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,369
nobody's actually been able to go in,

502
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,869
and there's no reports
of any kind of hauntings

503
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,429
or anything of that nature.

504
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,939
But, I think,

505
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,113
how can there not be?

506
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,169
With a tragedy like that,

507
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,579
the abandoned building.

508
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,389
It is the perfect atmosphere

509
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,723
for paranormal activity
to be taking place.

510
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,010
Yeah, I know, it was like maybe,

511
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:26,873
I don't know, five or six years ago.

512
00:24:28,124 --> 00:24:29,052
[Randy] And you still remember.

513
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:31,749
[Isabel] Mm-hm. Yeah.

514
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,649
[Randy] So, do you wanna tell us about

515
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,900
what's gonna happen here?

516
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,069
Yes. We're doing a cleansing today.

517
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,119
So, this woman, Judy,

518
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,040
has contacted me

519
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:46,449
because she has a spirit in the house.

520
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,279
And so, I'm here

521
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,909
to send the spirit,

522
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,573
so that it can be at peace.

523
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:54,930
- [Randy] Cool.
- So.

524
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:59,459
(knocking door)

525
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,336
Hello, Isabel.

526
00:25:01,337 --> 00:25:02,339
Hi, I'm Judy Perry.
- Hi, Judy.

527
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,260
Nice to meet you.

528
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:05,009
- Hi, fellas.
- [crew] Hi

529
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,129
Yeah, we have this
camera crew with us today.

530
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,716
You said that's okay.
- Yes, you mentioned that.

531
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:11,139
(Isabel laughing)

532
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,973
I'm just gonna...

533
00:25:11,974 --> 00:25:13,209
I don't remember exactly what I told you

534
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,639
about the circumstances around here,

535
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,929
so, I'll just tell you everything.

536
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,559
[Isabel] Okay.

537
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,420
My husband, Skip,

538
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:21,129
passed away six months, three weeks

539
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,454
and two days ago.

540
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:23,288
Okay.

541
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,049
And since that happened,

542
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,319
I've had several things

543
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,949
that have been disconcerting to me.

544
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,689
I mean, I think, probably most people.

545
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,677
One thing that happened,

546
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:33,683
and this has happened a couple of times.

547
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,039
Skip used to get my coffee every morning.

548
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,969
One morning I had had coffee, I took,

549
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,839
let me go in here and show you.

550
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,119
I had taken my empty coffee cup,

551
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,359
set it right here,

552
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,819
went into the bedroom

553
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,239
to try and go to get dressed for the day.

554
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,220
And when I came back out,

555
00:25:51,221 --> 00:25:53,170
I was gonna put it into the dishwasher.

556
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,339
It was full and it was hot.

557
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,340
It was steaming.

558
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,019
I mean, that's a little hello, right?

559
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
[Isabel] Mm-hm.

560
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,633
We used to have a little deal.

561
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,609
I would do the sorting of the laundry,

562
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,749
and I would put it in
the machine and wash it,

563
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,149
and then he would take
it out of the machine,

564
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,969
put it into the dryer, dry it

565
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,539
and fold it, put it away.

566
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,564
He kinda got the raw deal, if you ask me.

567
00:26:19,565 --> 00:26:20,629
(both laughing)

568
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,289
So, I had put the laundry in the washer,

569
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,589
and it was late at night,

570
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,649
and I thought, I'm just gonna go to sleep.

571
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,729
I'll put it in the dryer in the morning.

572
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,783
I came in here, and it was folded.

573
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,114
It was folded.

574
00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:34,948
Oh.

575
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:35,989
I feel something in this corner.

576
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,823
You do?

577
00:26:36,823 --> 00:26:37,656
Mm-hm.

578
00:26:37,656 --> 00:26:38,489
Yeah.

579
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,749
That's typical with kind
of hotspots like this.

580
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,309
Do you feel him? Do you feel a...

581
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,619
I don't know what it is, but...

582
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,599
Does it feel angry or sad?

583
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,609
I'm not sure yet,

584
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,687
but it's kind of confirming
what you're saying, so.

585
00:26:48,688 --> 00:26:50,019
Oh.

586
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,489
Wow! That's very exciting.

587
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,149
I mean, I just love the
idea that it is him,

588
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,110
- Yeah.
- And yet I don't want him

589
00:26:56,111 --> 00:26:57,149
to be unhappy.

590
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,044
Right.

591
00:26:58,044 --> 00:26:59,010
- You know?
- Yeah.

592
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:00,673
There's this little voice,

593
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,569
very high pitched, like a little baby,

594
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,209
little baby voice

595
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,759
under a pile of blankets.

596
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,249
It's very muffled.

597
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,250
It's like,

598
00:27:10,423 --> 00:27:14,291
"Help".
(whispers)

599
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:16,885
"Help".
(whispers)

600
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:18,063
Is that weird?

601
00:27:18,064 --> 00:27:20,083
It's like, baby Skip.

602
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,150
You know,

603
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,416
Judy, I totally understand why you would-

604
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:26,629
[Judy] You do?

605
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,879
I mean, this is not...

606
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,559
I wouldn't say it's
normal for me, but it's...

607
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,789
This is within the realm of standard.

608
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,623
[Judy] Oh.

609
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:35,456
You know?

610
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:36,310
[Judy] It's so reassuring.

611
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:38,989
So, what you're saying is that this...

612
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,169
You're not necessarily feeling distressed.

613
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,003
No.

614
00:27:42,004 --> 00:27:43,829
I mean, I do think it's Skip.

615
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,219
So, it doesn't distress me.

616
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,539
- Yeah.
- I love him.

617
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,329
But, I don't want him to be unhappy.

618
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,190
- [Isabel] We wanna...
- We want...

619
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:51,509
[Isabel] To set him at peace.

620
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,460
Yes.

621
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:54,099
Go. Go with God, honey.

622
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,050
Yep.

623
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:57,019
My method,

624
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,929
it'll probably take
about 20 to 30 minutes.

625
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,189
- [Judy] That's fast.
- Mm-hm.

626
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,609
It is best, if the loved
one is not in the room.

627
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,809
[Judy] Oh, you don't want me to here.

628
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,209
It just allows the spirit
to let go more easily.

629
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,339
- [Judy] Of course.
- So, I'll just ask you

630
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,449
to be in another room

631
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,044
for the 20, 30 minutes.
- I can.

632
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:11,878
Okay.

633
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:13,489
And then I'll just let you know,

634
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,323
when it's done.

635
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:15,509
So, I'm gonna go to my car

636
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,500
get some equipment.

637
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,340
So, if you just wanna,

638
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:18,839
I don't know if there
are any kind of things

639
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,959
you want to say to Skip...
- I've got some reading to do.

640
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,079
[Isabel] To let him go.

641
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,106
- Absolutely.
- [Isabel] In peace.

642
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:22,940
Absolutely.

643
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,833
[Isabel] And then you can
just go to the other room.

644
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:24,666
- Okay.
- [Isabel] I'll come back,

645
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:26,289
and I'll set him free.

646
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,379
I'm so relieved.

647
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,469
[Isabel] Okay.
I'm so relieved.

648
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,499
I didn't know it would happen today,

649
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,000
but thank you so much...
- Yeah.

650
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,009
- Isabel.
- So, I'll just run to my car

651
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,409
and grab some of my equipment.

652
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,939
- [Judy] Buh-bye.
- Bye.

653
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,940
[Randy] Thank you.

654
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,239
[Randy] So, is this
the only thing you do

655
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,200
when you come to these cleansings?

656
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,253
Not to the clients.

657
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,279
I mean, what's nice about smudging

658
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,310
is that it leaves

659
00:29:03,996 --> 00:29:06,379
a physical, like a smell,

660
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,709
you know, that something's happened.

661
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,169
So, it's like,

662
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,121
it represents the spirit passing on.

663
00:29:11,122 --> 00:29:12,793
So.
- Smells good.

664
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:13,794
Yeah.

665
00:29:17,206 --> 00:29:19,409
I mean, I get a lot of calls from

666
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,309
especially, it seems like a lot of widows.

667
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,439
So, I don't know what's going on there,

668
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
if it's like,

669
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,789
you know, women having trouble letting go

670
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,790
or something,

671
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,199
But, you know, this does actually,

672
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,800
I mean, it seems to help 'cause,

673
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,910
you know,

674
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,393
I haven't gotten any complaints.

675
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,229
We'll just hit it in here.

676
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,140
This is a nice touch,

677
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:44,959
'cause now her laundry
will smell like sage,

678
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
and it'll be like...

679
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,529
But, 20 to 30 minutes is still fast,

680
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,454
but a reasonable amount of time

681
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:53,336
(phone buzzing)

682
00:29:53,337 --> 00:29:55,469
To set a spirit free.

683
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,303
[Randy] Hey, Rob,

684
00:29:56,304 --> 00:29:57,687
I'm gonna take this. It's Wes.

685
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,989
[Isabel] Judy?

686
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,990
[Judy] Yes.

687
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,553
(door knocking)

688
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:09,470
Yes?

689
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,470
Hi, Isabel.

690
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:12,273
How did it go? Are you done?

691
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:13,107
Yeah.

692
00:30:13,107 --> 00:30:14,024
- Okay.
- All done.

693
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:15,814
- Well.
- So, you can come out.

694
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,555
That was pretty quick, wasn't it?

695
00:30:17,556 --> 00:30:18,460
Yeah.

696
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:20,879
- Well, that was easy, huh?
- [Isabel] Yeah.

697
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,131
Yeah.

698
00:30:22,132 --> 00:30:22,965
So, I will invoice you.

699
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:23,798
Okay. Okay, great.

700
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:24,899
I was gonna ask.

701
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,039
Yep.

702
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,759
So, I've got your contact info,

703
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,479
and so you'll get that.

704
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,313
- Okay.
- Just in

705
00:30:30,313 --> 00:30:31,146
probably like 20 minutes.
- In the email?

706
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:31,979
- Yep.
- Okay.

707
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:32,812
All right.

708
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:34,413
Okay, Isabel. Thank you so much.

709
00:30:34,414 --> 00:30:35,247
I'm so, so thankful.
- [Isabel] All right.

710
00:30:35,247 --> 00:30:36,130
Thanks, Judy.

711
00:30:36,131 --> 00:30:37,899
And you guys, thanks so much...

712
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,820
[Randy] Nice to meet you. Thank you.

713
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,653
For your help today.

714
00:30:39,654 --> 00:30:41,939
- [Rob] Thank you.
- [Judy] Yeah. Okay.

715
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,920
All right.

716
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,890
You have a good day.

717
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,723
Thanks. You, too.

718
00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:45,556
Buh-bye.

719
00:30:45,556 --> 00:30:46,556
[Rob] Thank you, Judy.

720
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,529
[Rob] We got all we need, right?

721
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,530
Yeah.

722
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,943
Wes said he has some news for us.

723
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,010
Something to do with that school.

724
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,369
[Austin] Good or bad?

725
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,919
Good, good. I think.

726
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,613
[Rob] I mean, he'd only
call if he got it, right?

727
00:31:02,614 --> 00:31:03,520
We'll see what he says.

728
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:05,769
So, I have this idea.

729
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:09,629
I think, I can convince him, but if...

730
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,530
Would you be open to joining the show?

731
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,793
I think, I can win him over.

732
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,009
First of all, I don't
think he's gonna want that.

733
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,302
I think he wants it.

734
00:31:21,303 --> 00:31:22,749
But, I also don't know, like,

735
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,859
what would I be contributing?

736
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,693
You know, like...

737
00:31:27,694 --> 00:31:30,423
Just keep him grounded,
some sort of human element.

738
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,339
I don't think, (chuckles)

739
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,245
I don't think I'm gonna keep him grounded.

740
00:31:35,246 --> 00:31:37,329
I think you can.

741
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,330
I don't think he's gonna listen to me.

742
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,249
[Rob] I think it's worth a shot.

743
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,942
Worst thing he can do
is tell you to leave.

744
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:48,739
I mean, you've been tryna
fix that relationship

745
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,349
with him.

746
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,350
Yeah.

747
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,678
I mean, I don't...

748
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,722
So, the point of this show is...

749
00:31:56,723 --> 00:31:57,849
[Randy] To hunt ghosts.

750
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,809
But is it to help him?

751
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,989
Like, is it going to end up helping him?

752
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,661
[Randy] I think it will help him.

753
00:32:03,662 --> 00:32:04,799
And it's helping people.

754
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,869
I think, he wants to
help people, honestly.

755
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,070
I don't know if he's
doing it the right way.

756
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,619
But I think, truly,

757
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,853
that's what he wants to do.

758
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,823
It's just been a long time

759
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:17,703
since I've talked to him, you know.

760
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,070
I did not think that this is
how this day was gonna go.

761
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,899
All right! Very
exciting news, everybody!

762
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,779
We've gotten permission
to go to Lincoln School.

763
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,769
It is an enormous abandoned building,

764
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,979
been abandoned for years,

765
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,599
and I've always wanted to go

766
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,399
and do a spiritual investigation there,

767
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,059
and we got permission
to go to that school.

768
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,979
It took some aggressively
charismatic emails,

769
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,579
but we did it.

770
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,540
And we're going

771
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,029
and that's our next haunt.

772
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,150
Super excited!

773
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,079
- [Rob] We're good.
- Good.

774
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,409
All right!

775
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,589
Great job.

776
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,379
So, the other day,

777
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,839
when you were doing your exorcism,

778
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,459
deliverance or wherever it was,

779
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,959
she mentioned that you killed someone.

780
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,033
What was that about?

781
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,519
During exorcisms, actually,

782
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,859
demons will say a lot of things

783
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,579
to try to provoke everybody.

784
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,233
So, it was nothing.

785
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:15,589
[Rob] It seemed like you knew

786
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,003
what she was talking about.

787
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:19,963
What I...

788
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,129
If you saw a recognition,

789
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,349
it was that I recognized

790
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,679
that this possession was legit

791
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
and,

792
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,163
it needed to be expedited. So, yeah.

793
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,149
[Rob] Not gonna give us anything else?

794
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,333
I'd give you something if
there was more to give you.

795
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,239
Geoff!

796
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,599
- Wes! Hey, welcome.
- So good to meet you.

797
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,759
[Wes] Thank you so much!

798
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,909
Yes, I'm Geoff.

799
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,059
I'm also known as the owner's manual.

800
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,109
- The owner's manual!
- Yeah!

801
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,943
Hey, I'm so...

802
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:50,810
- That's great.
- Come on in, guys.

803
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:51,932
Oh, yeah. I'm so sorry.

804
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:53,879
This is the crew.

805
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,729
This is my producer, Randy.
- Producer.

806
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,710
Never met a producer before.

807
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:58,619
This is great.
- Here he is.

808
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,299
This is Austin. He's our sound guy.

809
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,133
[Geoff] Hey, Austin. How are you?

810
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:01,966
[Wes] And behind the camera, that's Rob.

811
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:02,799
You know what?

812
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,712
I'm so excited for you guys to meet her.

813
00:34:04,713 --> 00:34:05,546
Meet her?

814
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:06,799
You know, this place,

815
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,909
it does need a facelift,

816
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,119
but to me it's the
happiest place on earth.

817
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,599
She. Oh, the building is her.
- [Geoff] Yeah.

818
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,999
Of course.
- [Wes] Great.

819
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,579
So anyway, let's get rolling.

820
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,689
I have a few other engagements today,

821
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,739
but I'm very happy to give you a tour

822
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,240
and show you all the things
we have to offer here.

823
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,723
Oh, I'm sorry.

824
00:34:23,724 --> 00:34:25,559
This is a closed...

825
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,393
Is this...

826
00:34:26,394 --> 00:34:28,569
This is my sister, Isabel.

827
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,679
[Geoff Oh, it's your sister, Isabel.

828
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,513
Okay.

829
00:34:30,514 --> 00:34:32,539
Well, who else is gonna show up? (laughs)

830
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,719
That's a great...
(laughs)

831
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,553
That's a great question!

832
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:35,939
I'm Geoff. I'm the owner's manual.

833
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,369
I'm the owner.

834
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,069
And we have a beautiful tour.

835
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,079
I'm ready to show you guys.

836
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,169
But we gotta get moving.

837
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,289
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

838
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,399
Believe it or not, I own
more than one property.

839
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,039
So, there's a lot of
history to this place.

840
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
Great, great.

841
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,495
Randy, let me talk to you for a second.

842
00:34:52,496 --> 00:34:53,329
[Randy] No, let's keep going.

843
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,939
Because, I guess, he's busy.

844
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,299
I understand that he's busy,

845
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,069
but I just want to have
a quick word with you.

846
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,459
Really fast. So, you can cut.

847
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,617
I'm sorry, just a show thing...

848
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:04,561
Is everything okay?

849
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:06,599
Talk about the framing
here for a second.

850
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,549
[Geoff] We are in view.

851
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,420
[Wes] Did you do this?

852
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,395
This building is the show.

853
00:35:10,395 --> 00:35:11,228
[Geoff] I'm trying to be
as lenient as I can here...

854
00:35:11,229 --> 00:35:13,106
- This is my show!
- She's gonna help.

855
00:35:13,107 --> 00:35:14,339
[Geoff] There's a time issue.

856
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,173
Absolutely. Yeah, Geoff.

857
00:35:15,174 --> 00:35:17,029
[Geoff] I just don't want
to cut your tour short.

858
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,030
You know, so.

859
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,499
Yep. No, no, everything's great.

860
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,039
Everything's great.

861
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,393
Yeah, I'd rather spend
time inside than out here...

862
00:35:25,394 --> 00:35:26,370
- Yeah, me too.
- Even though the whole place

863
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,203
is beautiful.

864
00:35:27,203 --> 00:35:28,203
But, after you. Yeah.

865
00:35:29,511 --> 00:35:30,510
You're still recording? Great.

866
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:32,888
[Rob] Yeah, I'm gonna turn the light on.

867
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:33,722
There we go.

868
00:35:33,723 --> 00:35:35,306
This...

869
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:37,299
I think that looks better.

870
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,439
Let's do it that way.

871
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,409
So, basically he's just gonna
do an intro to the episode.

872
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,269
He's gonna talk to you about the building.

873
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,289
Just give us a tour.

874
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,123
Okay.

875
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:47,259
Is this gonna be at the
beginning of the movie

876
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,759
or at the end of the movie?

877
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,083
This is the opening to the show.

878
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,529
Yeah.
- Show? Okay.

879
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,939
Yeah.

880
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,075
We're gonna give 'em a show.

881
00:35:56,076 --> 00:35:57,060
(Wes laughs)

882
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:59,539
We're gonna give 'em
a show. Let's do it.

883
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,359
Hey, everybody, it's Wes Wheatley here.

884
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,979
Welcome to another episode of "Infrared".

885
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,840
I'm here with Geoff,

886
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:06,389
the owner of the Lincoln School,

887
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,043
which you've seen or heard so much about.

888
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,379
Oh, this is adorable.

889
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,330
Is this a...

890
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:14,539
- You know,
- An original...

891
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,359
This supposedly, after midnight,

892
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,709
serves fruit punch.

893
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,550
(Wes laughs)

894
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:20,899
[Wes] Well then, we're in luck.

895
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,740
Just fruit punch.

896
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,723
Great, nothing but fruit punch here,

897
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:24,309
- Till 8 am.
- And water.

898
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,049
Freshly brewed. Yeah, water.

899
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:26,883
Cool.

900
00:36:26,883 --> 00:36:27,840
All original, all authentic.

901
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,673
Great.

902
00:36:28,673 --> 00:36:29,506
Just like this whole building.

903
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:30,339
Terrific.

904
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,779
And we'll get a sponsorship
from fruit punch.

905
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,299
So, then the classrooms,

906
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,479
they all kind of have their own story.

907
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,269
This used to be the vice-principal's spot,

908
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,359
but then it was taken
over by Miss Schultz.

909
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,479
Miss Schultz was a
fascinating English teacher.

910
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,669
She shared a lot of stories-
- Can we go in?

911
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,899
Of course.

912
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,733
Thank you.

913
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:45,809
Miss Schultz was...

914
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,329
It was not the vice-principal

915
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,249
but took over from the vice-principal.

916
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,579
Yeah, she was an English teacher.

917
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,969
She would share stories of Germany

918
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,569
and her time there.

919
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,429
These quotes are scattered
and written throughout.

920
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,099
I always wondered what
some of these things meant,

921
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,769
but you might be able to detect more.

922
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,459
[Isabel] Wait, when were
these written? These notes?

923
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,939
Ah, they've come from
all different times.

924
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,117
I mean, hey, time is a
big question mark, right?

925
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:11,159
I want to kind of give
you guys a basic feel.

926
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,993
Now, there was

927
00:37:11,994 --> 00:37:15,782
the security guard did talk
about this corridor here.

928
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:18,519
When he would do is his night watch,

929
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,919
he'd hear laughter.

930
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,870
In this corridor?

931
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,703
In this corridor,

932
00:37:21,703 --> 00:37:22,680
and a lot of times that would come

933
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,620
from either bringing in...

934
00:37:23,621 --> 00:37:26,149
There was like a puppy in
here, he would hear laughter.

935
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,829
There was a child, he would hear laughter.

936
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,959
So...
- Interesting.

937
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,539
Just patterns of sound

938
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,410
that pass through here,

939
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:34,419
but this was a spot he would talk about

940
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,400
that he would hear things.

941
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:36,899
[Randy] Just for the...

942
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,982
So we have it,

943
00:37:37,983 --> 00:37:39,499
can you just show us upstairs as well,

944
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,333
maybe more of the building?

945
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:41,819
Hey, you gotta love your producer.

946
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,889
He's always thinking up! Right?

947
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,915
He sure is always thinking.

948
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,350
This is gonna be a great movie!

949
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:47,240
(Wes claps)
I have a great feeling!

950
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:49,390
[Wes] Yeah, yeah.
He's worth every penny!

951
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,309
The higher up we go,

952
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,119
the more interesting it gets.

953
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,129
Interest rises, right?

954
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:55,963
Look at this!

955
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:56,900
(Wes laughs)

956
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:59,489
This is the happiest day of his life.

957
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,269
That's what I do. I make people happy.

958
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,563
So, there was an art class in here.

959
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,079
A painter from Spain would come through.

960
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,219
The light comes in at
very interesting angles.

961
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,599
He used to say that the sun burn

962
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,399
was starting to kind of fry
that part of the ceiling,

963
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,079
so the ceiling's starting to come down.

964
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,080
[Wes] Interesting.

965
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,633
[Isabel] He said that was burn?

966
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,409
I mean, the stories people come up with.

967
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,629
We all kind of make up our own reality.

968
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,129
That thing is bizarre.

969
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,969
Apparently, it's turned on on its own.

970
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:28,803
Oh, interesting.

971
00:38:28,804 --> 00:38:30,390
[Geoff] And even though
that outlet doesn't work,

972
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,224
- [Wes] It doesn't?
- So, I don't know.

973
00:38:31,224 --> 00:38:32,057
Yeah.

974
00:38:32,058 --> 00:38:33,789
Is there electricity
in the building at all?

975
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,780
No, not right now.

976
00:38:34,781 --> 00:38:36,589
[Rob] So, the exit signs,

977
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,693
they must be on a back-up service?

978
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,874
Hey.

979
00:38:41,874 --> 00:38:42,707
Or on a generator.

980
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,852
Maybe it's just a spirit.

981
00:38:44,853 --> 00:38:45,859
[Wes] Or maybe they are haunted, right?

982
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,649
Dr. Kenneth, when he was here,

983
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:51,799
he would teach psychology.

984
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,519
And he would walk into his
classroom early in the morning.

985
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,639
Nobody had been in here,

986
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,179
and he would just smell traces
of smoke, cigarette smoke.

987
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,639
I don't think the doctor did these.

988
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,419
He's not really into ballerinas.

989
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,547
But,

990
00:39:04,548 --> 00:39:05,450
(Wes laughs)

991
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,430
It's helped, you know.

992
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,263
(overlapping speech)

993
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,769
Again, there's codes here.

994
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,029
It's almost like you're...

995
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,429
You know, you go to, what
are those things called?

996
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,581
Escape rooms or something?

997
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:13,470
- Yeah.
- It's like

998
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,370
that might be a code word,

999
00:39:14,371 --> 00:39:16,239
that might be nothing.

1000
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,240
You know, how you could
grab this here and write,

1001
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,370
Mr. Geoff versus

1002
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,711
Wes, the hero.

1003
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:28,545
(Wes laughs)

1004
00:39:28,546 --> 00:39:29,679
Wes, the hero.

1005
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,513
You see what he's doing?

1006
00:39:30,513 --> 00:39:31,346
He's scoping everything out.

1007
00:39:31,347 --> 00:39:34,209
That's the kind of person
you need in your life.

1008
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,210
[Wes] Yeah, that's why I've got him.

1009
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:36,509
He sees the big picture.

1010
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,804
That's where things happen.

1011
00:39:37,805 --> 00:39:38,680
[Wes] That's right.

1012
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:41,873
He knows how to sculpt a narrative.

1013
00:39:43,138 --> 00:39:44,189
It may not be Hearst Castle,

1014
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,639
but it's got character.

1015
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,729
One time this guy came in,

1016
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,229
and he's like, "Wait, I feel
really dizzy when I walked in."

1017
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,063
It's like, well, no shit,

1018
00:39:50,064 --> 00:39:51,569
you had like two drinks

1019
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,749
before you came here, you know?

1020
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,609
So, I always like to just
see through the nonsense.

1021
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,299
But, again, I'm open-minded.

1022
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,809
I just haven't seen anything
that's convinced me.

1023
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,643
Sure.

1024
00:40:00,643 --> 00:40:01,490
In these...

1025
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:03,480
Not to diminish your efforts, but,

1026
00:40:04,328 --> 00:40:05,161
(locker door closes)

1027
00:40:05,162 --> 00:40:06,669
Hopefully you find
something that's concrete.

1028
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,829
[Wes] Yeah, yeah, for maybe...

1029
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,379
I want this movie to be good.

1030
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,430
Yeah, the show.

1031
00:40:10,431 --> 00:40:12,539
The show is gonna be a hit.

1032
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,919
Okay.

1033
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,253
Before you go,

1034
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,829
if you could, for the camera...

1035
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,689
There's been a lot of rumors. Right?

1036
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,459
About why the place closed down.

1037
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,739
And I would love to get
you telling the camera

1038
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,499
the real story of...

1039
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,393
You want me to be the movie star. Okay.

1040
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:30,227
(Wes laughs)

1041
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:32,229
Yeah, yeah. You're gonna
be the star of this episode.

1042
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,769
Let's all get closer.

1043
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,072
Let's get a...
- How's that look?

1044
00:40:35,073 --> 00:40:36,439
A quick snap.

1045
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,709
Yep.
(chuckles)

1046
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,629
So, the school, again, it's...

1047
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,269
Oh, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

1048
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,419
So, I'm gonna intro it,

1049
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,929
and then I'll throw it to you.

1050
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,199
Hey, everyone, Wes Wheatley here.

1051
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,180
Welcome back to "Infrared".

1052
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,013
We're here with Geoff,

1053
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:49,550
the owner's manual

1054
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,559
of Lincoln School.

1055
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,405
And he's about to put
those rumors to sleep.

1056
00:40:55,406 --> 00:40:57,339
Anyone who's been on
the Facebook group page,

1057
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,019
we've all heard a lot of crazy things.

1058
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,229
So, Geoff.

1059
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,799
I'm a little nervous,
I don't do this often.

1060
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,322
Yeah, why did it get abandoned?

1061
00:41:03,323 --> 00:41:05,459
I'm not into the whole whatever
it's called, the Facebook,

1062
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,759
I just like to tell the cold, hard truth.

1063
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,899
This is an amazing place,

1064
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,009
it's an inspiring place,

1065
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,909
a lot of great stuff has happened here.

1066
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,859
Unfortunately, the school closed down.

1067
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,839
There was a terrible, terrible tragedy,

1068
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,969
and it happened in the
lower level classrooms.

1069
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:24,499
There was a teacher, and five students,

1070
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,819
and there was a gas
leak, and they were like,

1071
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,843
they were trapped.

1072
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:34,121
It's hard for me to talk about it.

1073
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:35,369
Yeah.

1074
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,203
So, it was like,

1075
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:38,759
did you say the lower level classrooms?

1076
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,669
I had read that it took
place in the basement.

1077
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,489
There's all kinds of
stories that people tell,

1078
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,193
but it was the lower level.

1079
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:48,429
And it was a horrible tragedy.

1080
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,129
And I still try to-

1081
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,909
Would you be able to
say it one more time

1082
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,699
and just say that it was the basement,

1083
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,238
say that it happened in the basement?

1084
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,319
So, yeah, it closed the school down,

1085
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,609
And my wife, she's an
amazing teacher as well.

1086
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,979
We want this place to come back to life,

1087
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,359
because we can't live in the past.

1088
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,330
We want to live in the future,

1089
00:42:06,331 --> 00:42:07,379
and we go to these groups,

1090
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,619
and we talk about moving forward.

1091
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,159
And one of the theories is you know,

1092
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,000
you gotta forge ahead,

1093
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,920
and you gotta kick ass,

1094
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,910
and you gotta move forward.

1095
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,289
We're trying to come
back bigger and better.

1096
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:17,619
And that's...

1097
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,269
Did your wife work here also?

1098
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,319
She taught here, yeah. She taught here.

1099
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,153
She did? She was a teacher here?

1100
00:42:22,154 --> 00:42:23,369
She was a teacher here.

1101
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:27,319
Well, not like right there.
(laughs)

1102
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,153
What did she teach?

1103
00:42:28,153 --> 00:42:28,986
Oh, she's a...

1104
00:42:28,987 --> 00:42:31,729
Oh my God, she's just the
most amazing music teacher.

1105
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:32,563
Wow!

1106
00:42:32,564 --> 00:42:33,939
- I mean...
- Does she still teach?

1107
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,059
She's so great,

1108
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,687
she almost taught me how
to play one note of guitar.

1109
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:38,521
(all laughing)

1110
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:39,679
She got me to play "The Twilight Zone".

1111
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,749
That's all I could learn how to play.

1112
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,758
Oh, wow.

1113
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:44,049
She's a very passionate music teacher.

1114
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,599
Did she teach all
different levels of music?

1115
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,778
- I mean,
- Yeah.

1116
00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:48,612
Like, Kindergarten to on up.

1117
00:42:48,613 --> 00:42:50,659
She can do everything, yeah.

1118
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,580
She's brilliant.

1119
00:42:51,581 --> 00:42:55,219
But anyway, I'm kind of
taking over your show here.

1120
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,053
No, no, no.

1121
00:42:56,053 --> 00:42:56,886
Sorry, but I'll...

1122
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:57,719
You're doing such an awesome job.

1123
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,369
In fact, if we could,

1124
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,879
what would be terrific would be

1125
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,999
if we could actually get
access to the basement,

1126
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,772
because, I'm not sure if you know this,

1127
00:43:07,773 --> 00:43:10,400
but for the show, it's true that

1128
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,740
the point of a trauma or a tragedy

1129
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,479
fosters the most vulnerable space

1130
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,579
for spiritual activity.

1131
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,529
- So...
- Well, last I know,

1132
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:23,609
it's a storage unit.

1133
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:24,729
It's got a bunch of junk in there

1134
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:25,759
from when the school closed.

1135
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,419
So, it's not like anything like this,

1136
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,989
you know, but...

1137
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:30,823
No, no, no.

1138
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:32,099
And this is great. I cannot wait to...

1139
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,119
I mean, trust me, we're gonna...

1140
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,466
Every inch of this place,
we're gonna get to it.

1141
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:37,300
You know, I gotta run.

1142
00:43:37,301 --> 00:43:39,319
If you really want to,

1143
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,909
one of these I think,
will get you in there.

1144
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,459
Into the basement?

1145
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,659
I can't make any promises.

1146
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,099
I don't know it's...

1147
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,629
But anyway, I gotta run.

1148
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:48,463
Yeah, yeah.

1149
00:43:48,464 --> 00:43:50,689
[Geoff] Hey, I wish you guys
all the success in the world.

1150
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:51,523
[Wes] Thank you so much.

1151
00:43:51,524 --> 00:43:53,483
We really, really appreciate this.

1152
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,349
I'll be around.

1153
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,109
So, make yourselves at home.

1154
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:58,943
Okay.

1155
00:43:58,943 --> 00:43:59,776
And, you know,

1156
00:43:59,777 --> 00:44:01,199
let me know if you need anything.

1157
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,033
[Wes] Great.

1158
00:44:02,033 --> 00:44:02,866
[Geoff] Be safe.

1159
00:44:02,867 --> 00:44:04,020
Yeah. Thank you so much.

1160
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:11,224
Did you know she was gonna be here?

1161
00:44:11,225 --> 00:44:12,058
You did?

1162
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:13,580
[Rob] Yeah.

1163
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:17,659
Did he tell you? I
mean, how did you know?

1164
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,660
[Rob] We...

1165
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:20,443
I mean, you're gonna find out.

1166
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:22,149
We shot with her the other day.

1167
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,537
Randy thought that...

1168
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,300
You shot with her the other day?

1169
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,720
[Rob] Randy didn't feel the show

1170
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:33,133
was as dynamic as it could be, and...

1171
00:44:34,243 --> 00:44:35,859
Are you recording all this?

1172
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,519
[Rob] To use an old saying,

1173
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,453
y'know, get the band back together.

1174
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,989
I mean, like, would it not be nice

1175
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,373
to hang out with your sister,

1176
00:44:44,374 --> 00:44:45,579
again?
- No.

1177
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,139
No, it would not be nice.

1178
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,233
Otherwise, I'd have her here.

1179
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,889
[Rob] She is here.

1180
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,890
I would have invited her here, I mean.

1181
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,129
[Rob] I'm gonna go get some B-roll.

1182
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,000
Okay?

1183
00:44:58,001 --> 00:44:59,329
Sure.

1184
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,753
Make some good music with the old band.

1185
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,403
[Rob] All right.
(whispers)

1186
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:09,269
[Randy] So, it'd really
help if you stayed.

1187
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,648
How is it?

1188
00:45:10,649 --> 00:45:11,482
I don't know how it's helping.

1189
00:45:11,483 --> 00:45:12,839
I'm not, I'm not helping.

1190
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,869
I'm not helping by being here.

1191
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,109
He doesn't want me to be here.

1192
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,569
I don't wanna be here.

1193
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,199
- It's gonna help him.
- How?

1194
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,977
What does that-Oh my God.

1195
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:23,271
(footsteps banging)

1196
00:45:23,272 --> 00:45:24,862
How you doing guys? B-roll?

1197
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,196
[Rob] some B-roll for the, yep.

1198
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:30,170
[Randy] So, can you tell us about

1199
00:45:30,171 --> 00:45:31,989
what you're doing right now?

1200
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,189
Right now, I'm setting up a camera

1201
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,109
that has infrared capacity

1202
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:39,259
to film this hallway.

1203
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,093
[Randy] Cool. Okay.

1204
00:45:40,093 --> 00:45:40,926
So, what we're gonna do?

1205
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:43,083
We're gonna do an intro
with you and Isabel.

1206
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,219
So, we're gonna go get her now.

1207
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,059
Wait, what are you talking about?

1208
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,229
We're gonna do an intro
with me and Isabel.

1209
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:52,499
This is my show.

1210
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,669
[Randy] You want a good show?

1211
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,095
This is what I do.

1212
00:45:55,096 --> 00:45:56,759
But what we're doing a show
in the building right now.

1213
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,593
We can do the intro,

1214
00:45:57,594 --> 00:45:59,487
with you two in the building.

1215
00:46:00,462 --> 00:46:02,262
- What the fuck?
- [Randy] Double the ratings.

1216
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:06,364
[Randy] Let's do this.

1217
00:46:06,365 --> 00:46:07,198
You're gonna love it.

1218
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:08,229
Trust me.

1219
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:11,404
Trust me, I do this for a living.

1220
00:46:11,405 --> 00:46:14,569
(sighs)
- I got you off Craigslist.

1221
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:15,919
You do this for a living.

1222
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,920
Sure, bring her up.

1223
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,079
[Randy] Take it away, Wes.

1224
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,080
Give me an action.

1225
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,370
[Randy] Action!

1226
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:26,203
Hey everybody.

1227
00:46:26,204 --> 00:46:28,908
It's Wes Wheatley here and,

1228
00:46:28,909 --> 00:46:30,279
Izzy Wheatley.

1229
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,939
And we're here at the Lincoln School

1230
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,670
where we are looking to...

1231
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:40,323
Let's...

1232
00:46:40,323 --> 00:46:41,156
That sucks.

1233
00:46:41,157 --> 00:46:42,439
Hey everybody, it's Wes Wheatley here.

1234
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,689
[Randy] You don't need to do that again.

1235
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,523
I'll just fucking do it.

1236
00:46:44,523 --> 00:46:45,480
Just let me roll into it.

1237
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,360
Hey everybody.

1238
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:47,473
Hey everyone.

1239
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,529
Hey everyone, Wes Wheatley here and...

1240
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:52,363
Izzy Wheatley.

1241
00:46:52,364 --> 00:46:54,409
And we're here at Lincoln School,

1242
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:57,259
which has been such a dream come true,

1243
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,909
being able to get into this facility.

1244
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:01,659
I've wanted to get in here
for the last 10 years.

1245
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,359
And here we are.

1246
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,999
[Randy] What about if
you two do it together?

1247
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,681
If you Izzy, you start

1248
00:47:06,682 --> 00:47:09,253
and you just explain
to the camera together.

1249
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:13,803
And this is an infrared camera.

1250
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,773
That Wes set up.

1251
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:23,250
Wes, do you wanna...

1252
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:24,339
That's what it is...

1253
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,173
- Say some more about it
- It's an infrared camera

1254
00:47:25,174 --> 00:47:28,283
that I set up.
(chuckling)

1255
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Oh man.

1256
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,109
Randy, did you talk to him?

1257
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,139
[Randy] I haven't had a chance yet,

1258
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,003
but I'm gonna talk to him.

1259
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,213
This isn't working.

1260
00:47:51,173 --> 00:47:52,659
Randy, it's not helping. I'm not helping.

1261
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,959
You said I was coming to help.

1262
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,747
How is this helping?

1263
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,119
(footsteps)

1264
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,120
How?

1265
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:00,779
He needs more confidence.

1266
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,899
I think, you can give him that confidence.

1267
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,900
It's not, I can't do it.

1268
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,113
I'm not.

1269
00:48:06,114 --> 00:48:07,609
How am I gonna give him confidence.

1270
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,360
[Randy] He needs your acceptance.

1271
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:12,579
I think he's just lacking something

1272
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,549
that I cannot give.

1273
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,939
I think, you can help.

1274
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,940
I mean, if...

1275
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:20,489
He doesn't wanna talk to me.

1276
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,857
He hasn't wanted to talk
to me for two years.

1277
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,894
You wanna help him, right?

1278
00:48:24,895 --> 00:48:25,895
Yeah.

1279
00:48:28,361 --> 00:48:29,652
Do you have to do that now?

1280
00:48:29,653 --> 00:48:30,949
What will help him is,

1281
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,917
is if the show will work,

1282
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:35,168
'cause it's not working
at the moment, right?

1283
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,469
We want it to work as well.

1284
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,989
Let's work together.

1285
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,140
Let's make this happen.

1286
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:44,043
I mean, I'll try talking to him.

1287
00:48:44,044 --> 00:48:45,454
I don't think he'll talk to me.

1288
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:46,559
Please.

1289
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,560
Thank you.

1290
00:49:04,843 --> 00:49:08,829
Why did you decide to come, by the way?

1291
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:12,222
Because, Randy said that I would help.

1292
00:49:12,223 --> 00:49:13,851
He said that you would help,

1293
00:49:13,852 --> 00:49:14,741
with the show?

1294
00:49:14,741 --> 00:49:15,599
Yeah...

1295
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,344
- Like, a crew member.
- You would want me here

1296
00:49:17,345 --> 00:49:19,099
and that I would help.

1297
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,090
[Wes] Help doing what?

1298
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:21,099
I don't know.

1299
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,010
I mean, that's why I told him,

1300
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:23,010
I was gonna leave.

1301
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,250
Are you gonna leave?

1302
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,200
I mean, I will, if you want me to.

1303
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,539
You might as well leave

1304
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:39,820
because, this show is a sinking ship.

1305
00:49:41,955 --> 00:49:43,655
You drive me fucking crazy.

1306
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:49,185
But, you are really good at this stuff.

1307
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:51,900
You do not...

1308
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:52,999
- I do.
- Think that.

1309
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,369
I do.
- You never thought that.

1310
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:57,299
I do, You've been doing
this since we were like,

1311
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,639
I mean, like,

1312
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,389
you were like six years old

1313
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,429
and you were like, "The
Wes Wheatley Show".

1314
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:03,949
This has been your dream forever.

1315
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,463
And now we're finally here.

1316
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:08,029
You made it to the Lincoln School,

1317
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,919
which nobody has been able to get into.

1318
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,849
And you did that.

1319
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,413
You're here for a reason.

1320
00:50:15,038 --> 00:50:16,688
But the show is going terribly.

1321
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,519
I was the first one to get in here

1322
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,799
and now I could fuck it up.

1323
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,238
- But it's your own show.
- Great!

1324
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:27,329
You've never done this before.

1325
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:29,039
So, of course you're not gonna be like,

1326
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,290
you gotta figure it out,

1327
00:50:32,043 --> 00:50:33,903
but you were made to do this Wes.

1328
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:36,810
You might...

1329
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,543
Drive me crazy, but that's true.

1330
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:45,169
I thought the camera would be on

1331
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,779
and it'd be like, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom.

1332
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,930
Like when I was a kid.

1333
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,453
Do you remember your motto?

1334
00:50:54,507 --> 00:50:58,120
"I'm Wes Wheatley and I can't lose".

1335
00:50:58,121 --> 00:50:58,954
(Wes chuckling)

1336
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,719
Well, it hasn't felt like that.

1337
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,720
Well...

1338
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:05,750
Let's get back in there.

1339
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:10,030
You're gonna...

1340
00:51:11,414 --> 00:51:12,247
Do you wanna stick around?

1341
00:51:12,248 --> 00:51:15,057
You wanna be part of the "Wes
Wheatley Can't Lose Show"?

1342
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,619
Let's just get in there and do the show.

1343
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,620
I'll do that.

1344
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,900
If you admit,

1345
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,100
you feel something in here.

1346
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:33,669
Isabel, don't fuck around with me.

1347
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:37,213
It's drafty.
( Isabel laughing)

1348
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:40,719
It's an old drafty school. That's true.

1349
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,979
Well, let's get down to
the fucking drafty basement

1350
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,439
and find some God damn ghosts.

1351
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,919
Hey everybody. Welcome back to "Infrared".

1352
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,979
I'm Wes Wheatley and I'm
here with... Izzy Wheatley.

1353
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:54,293
Izzy Wheatley, how about some pep?

1354
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,659
One more time.

1355
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:57,493
[Randy] Action.

1356
00:51:57,494 --> 00:51:58,499
Hey everybody, welcome
back to "Infrared".

1357
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,739
I'm Wes Wheatley and I'm here with...

1358
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,369
Izzy Wheatley.

1359
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,249
And we are here at the basement door.

1360
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,553
So, let's go inside.

1361
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,259
You might recall,

1362
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,529
but this is the location
where the gas leak took place

1363
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:13,109
that actually saw the building condemned,

1364
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:16,409
where a teacher and five
students were killed,

1365
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:18,769
making this the most vulnerable
place in the building

1366
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,946
for spiritual activities.

1367
00:52:20,947 --> 00:52:21,780
These keys don't work.

1368
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,613
I need you to call Geoff

1369
00:52:22,614 --> 00:52:25,533
and tell him that the
basement key isn't here.

1370
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,849
Just tell him to bring all
of the building keys down

1371
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,159
so that one of the keys would,

1372
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,510
can you do that? Thank you.

1373
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:35,820
Okay.

1374
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:37,933
Okay.

1375
00:52:37,933 --> 00:52:38,766
Back upstairs.

1376
00:52:38,766 --> 00:52:39,766
Flashlights up.

1377
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:42,809
All right. Ready?

1378
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:43,810
Welcome back,

1379
00:52:45,202 --> 00:52:46,560
to "Infrared".

1380
00:52:46,561 --> 00:52:47,394
Infrared.
(chuckles)

1381
00:52:47,394 --> 00:52:48,350
Say it with me,

1382
00:52:48,351 --> 00:52:52,139
[Both] Welcome back to "Infrared".

1383
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,199
We'll work on that.

1384
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,259
I've got my EMF meter

1385
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,299
and what we're doing currently

1386
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,569
is we're gonna be
roaming the dark hallways

1387
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:03,563
of Lincoln School here.

1388
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,739
And we're gonna be using this EMF meter

1389
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,599
as our trusty guide

1390
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,289
to see where we can start to pick up

1391
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,043
on some electromagnetic frequencies.

1392
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,740
It smells in here.

1393
00:53:34,584 --> 00:53:36,219
Yeah!

1394
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,680
[Randy] Is that a quite common thing?

1395
00:53:38,681 --> 00:53:39,514
It is.

1396
00:53:39,515 --> 00:53:40,519
[Randy] With spirits.

1397
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,353
It's a common thing

1398
00:53:41,354 --> 00:53:43,463
in an old abandoned location.

1399
00:53:56,532 --> 00:53:57,859
I think, this is the location.

1400
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,929
The room where he mentioned

1401
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:01,409
that there's a security guard

1402
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:02,243
that comes around

1403
00:54:02,244 --> 00:54:04,929
that sometimes smells

1404
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:08,427
cigarette smoke.
- Oh yeah, like, smoke. Yeah.

1405
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:15,299
I think, that this is probably nothing,

1406
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,273
but let's bear the name Hannah in mind.

1407
00:54:19,317 --> 00:54:20,150
Okay. So, Izzy do you know

1408
00:54:20,151 --> 00:54:21,543
how to use an EMF meter?

1409
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,882
You just hold it.

1410
00:54:24,883 --> 00:54:26,289
(Wes giggling)

1411
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,123
That's true.

1412
00:54:27,124 --> 00:54:28,719
- Right?
- Yeah.

1413
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,189
Although, Izzy's job is
not using the EMF meter

1414
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:34,569
because anyone can do that.

1415
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:37,733
Izzy's job is to trust her intuition,

1416
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:43,079
because, Izzy is intuitively

1417
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,419
far more sensitive

1418
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,459
to the spirit realm

1419
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:48,429
than any of the instruments that I have.

1420
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:51,512
Izzy, in fact, is the reason...
- Let's go upstairs.

1421
00:54:51,513 --> 00:54:53,069
Izzy is the reason

1422
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:56,023
that I started doing
this in the first place.

1423
00:55:07,962 --> 00:55:08,962
Shh.

1424
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:12,980
Okay.

1425
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:19,809
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
(whispers)

1426
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:20,810
All right.

1427
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:24,850
We're getting some
interesting activity up here.

1428
00:55:26,853 --> 00:55:29,013
Let's see, if it get
stronger as we move up.

1429
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:32,970
Okay.

1430
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:37,503
Very interesting fluctuations right now.

1431
00:55:42,314 --> 00:55:43,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, twenty.

1432
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,660
Getting really high numbers right now.

1433
00:55:56,757 --> 00:56:01,757
Okay.

1434
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:03,491
Come on.

1435
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:10,349
(locker door bangs)

1436
00:56:23,557 --> 00:56:26,390
(EMF meter beeps)

1437
00:56:31,868 --> 00:56:32,868
Okay.

1438
00:56:42,081 --> 00:56:43,230
Okay.

1439
00:56:43,231 --> 00:56:44,369
(EMF meter beeps)

1440
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:45,413
Oh my God!

1441
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,327
That sounded like a locker.
(whispers)

1442
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:23,810
(EMF meter beeping)

1443
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:37,065
(locker door clunks)

1444
00:57:37,066 --> 00:57:40,399
(Wes breathing heavily)

1445
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,050
(EMF meter beeping)

1446
00:57:44,051 --> 00:57:45,051
Okay.

1447
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,483
This is the most fractured
signal I've ever seen.

1448
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:58,550
(EMF meter beeping)

1449
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:18,693
Look at that.

1450
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:22,277
Look at those fucking numbers.

1451
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:25,850
Holy shit!

1452
00:58:28,014 --> 00:58:30,665
(Isabel gasping)

1453
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:31,666
Holy shit!

1454
00:58:34,618 --> 00:58:35,875
Okay.

1455
00:58:35,876 --> 00:58:37,240
Guys?

1456
00:58:37,241 --> 00:58:38,823
Izzy,

1457
00:58:38,824 --> 00:58:40,454
Izzy,

1458
00:58:40,455 --> 00:58:41,288
what is it?

1459
00:58:41,289 --> 00:58:45,249
(EMF beeping continues)

1460
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,599
Izzy, okay, okay.

1461
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,733
Let me turn this off.

1462
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:49,710
Talk to me.

1463
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:52,916
What are you feeling?

1464
00:58:54,809 --> 00:58:57,059
Izzy, what are you feeling?

1465
00:58:57,912 --> 00:58:59,099
(Isabel weeping)

1466
00:58:59,100 --> 00:58:59,933
Huh?

1467
00:58:59,934 --> 00:59:01,066
It's here.
(sobbing)

1468
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:02,243
Where, where, where?

1469
00:59:03,365 --> 00:59:04,198
Where?

1470
00:59:04,198 --> 00:59:05,198
Show me.

1471
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,699
Izzy, stay with it.

1472
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,700
Show me.

1473
00:59:14,438 --> 00:59:15,271
Come on.

1474
00:59:15,272 --> 00:59:16,339
It's okay, it's okay.

1475
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,439
You're okay.

1476
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,440
Stay open.

1477
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,320
Where's the spot?

1478
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,480
Show me where it is

1479
00:59:37,194 --> 00:59:40,701
It's right here.
(sobbing)

1480
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:41,859
Right here?

1481
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,860
Yeah?

1482
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,820
Okay.

1483
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:46,973
Okay, so...

1484
00:59:49,536 --> 00:59:51,108
We're gonna get set up here.

1485
00:59:53,728 --> 00:59:56,395
(Spirit Box crackling)

1486
01:00:03,027 --> 01:00:06,444
If there are any spirits
present in this room,

1487
01:00:08,597 --> 01:00:10,892
we invite you to communicate with us.

1488
01:00:10,893 --> 01:00:15,893
(Spirit Box crackling)
(Isabel sobbing)

1489
01:00:22,113 --> 01:00:23,969
If there are any spirits in this room now,

1490
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:26,743
we invite you to communicate with us.

1491
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,860
Izzy.

1492
01:00:35,062 --> 01:00:37,170
I can't do it.

1493
01:00:37,171 --> 01:00:38,549
Huh?

1494
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:39,731
I can't do it.
(Isabel sobbing)

1495
01:00:39,732 --> 01:00:40,931
What are you talking about?

1496
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:42,265
I can't do it.

1497
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:44,598
Hey,

1498
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:47,539
Izzy.

1499
01:00:52,646 --> 01:00:55,312
Hey, are you getting something?

1500
01:00:55,313 --> 01:00:57,508
(Isabel crying)

1501
01:00:57,509 --> 01:00:59,676
Are you getting something?

1502
01:01:01,447 --> 01:01:03,739
Can we stop please?
(Isabel weeping)

1503
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,811
Izzy, no, no, no.

1504
01:01:05,812 --> 01:01:06,894
Hey, it's okay.

1505
01:01:06,895 --> 01:01:08,642
I wanna stop, please.

1506
01:01:08,643 --> 01:01:11,558
Izzy, please, please, please.

1507
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:13,309
Hey I'm sorry but..

1508
01:01:16,346 --> 01:01:17,893
What, what, what?

1509
01:01:17,894 --> 01:01:19,578
(door bangs)

1510
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:20,777
(Isabel gasping)

1511
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:22,861
Look, Izzy, Izzy, Izzy.

1512
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:25,947
Oh my God!

1513
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:28,449
What is wrong with...

1514
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,574
[Austin] It's not working..

1515
01:01:30,575 --> 01:01:33,939
[Wes] Rob, Rob, what the
fuck are you guys doing?

1516
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,440
I'm not going back in there.

1517
01:01:36,975 --> 01:01:38,968
That was so dark.

1518
01:01:38,969 --> 01:01:40,583
You don't know, you didn't feel it.

1519
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,760
That's true.

1520
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:44,660
I know.

1521
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:46,543
Listen, I know.

1522
01:01:46,544 --> 01:01:47,699
I understand.

1523
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,623
You're the one with the gift. Okay.

1524
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:51,750
And it is a gift.

1525
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,429
Which is why I need you.

1526
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:58,417
This is what you do,

1527
01:01:58,418 --> 01:01:59,599
you like using other people

1528
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,339
for your entertainment.
- That's not true.

1529
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:02,359
That's what you did with that guy.

1530
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,189
That's why he died.

1531
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,359
What happened with that guy,

1532
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,059
I felt fucking terrible about, all right.

1533
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,463
I was naive. I didn't
know what I was doing.

1534
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:12,286
No, this is exactly what you like to do.

1535
01:02:12,287 --> 01:02:13,120
You like to stir shit up.

1536
01:02:13,121 --> 01:02:14,309
You stir up all this dark.

1537
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:15,512
That's exactly what the show is all about.

1538
01:02:15,513 --> 01:02:16,563
It's not.

1539
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:21,429
Listen, you completely
misunderstand my interests.

1540
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:22,263
Okay?

1541
01:02:22,263 --> 01:02:23,096
The show is not about trying

1542
01:02:23,097 --> 01:02:25,089
to stir any darkness out.

1543
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:26,519
My interest has always been,

1544
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,409
always been trying to find out

1545
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:30,749
how to be able to set

1546
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,603
that dark realm free.

1547
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:36,663
That's true.

1548
01:02:36,664 --> 01:02:38,519
And from what I have seen,

1549
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,053
the way that you do that
is by acknowledging them.

1550
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,523
Let them be seen.

1551
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,533
But I cannot do that on my own.

1552
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:54,410
I need you.

1553
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:59,844
So, can we please,

1554
01:02:59,845 --> 01:03:02,039
Izzy, please, please.

1555
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,749
Will you please go back in there with me

1556
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,839
and help me find a way

1557
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,873
to give this place some peace.

1558
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:18,027
You felt that.

1559
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,499
Okay.

1560
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,500
Come on.

1561
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:30,586
Come on.
- Just give me a second.

1562
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:33,069
Alright. Hey guys, break's over.

1563
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:34,520
We're gonna go back in, okay.

1564
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,219
[Randy] Can we ask you a few questions?

1565
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,747
If you're okay with it?

1566
01:03:40,194 --> 01:03:41,277
About what?

1567
01:03:43,483 --> 01:03:45,566
What happened up there?

1568
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,550
Sometimes...

1569
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,403
Sometimes I'm able to feel,

1570
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:06,853
spirits.

1571
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:10,410
The dark ones are...

1572
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:15,984
It's really hard.

1573
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:17,780
They're really...

1574
01:04:26,231 --> 01:04:28,398
There's just a lot of pain

1575
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,870
and fear

1576
01:04:32,606 --> 01:04:33,619
and it's uh

1577
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,783
it's just overwhelming.

1578
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:38,500
[Randy] Was the one up there... bad?

1579
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:45,619
You didn't feel anything, Wes?

1580
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:46,789
Not like that.

1581
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:47,979
I mean, I sometimes,

1582
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:48,850
there's a little something,

1583
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,880
but it's nothing like...

1584
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,313
Izzy's got a gift.

1585
01:04:55,985 --> 01:04:57,759
That was the biggest reaction, I've seen.

1586
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,289
I've seen her react.

1587
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:00,123
When we were young,

1588
01:05:00,123 --> 01:05:01,123
it was a...

1589
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:04,063
Yeah.

1590
01:05:04,064 --> 01:05:05,850
We didn't know what was going on, but

1591
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,227
that was a big one.

1592
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,520
I think,

1593
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:18,103
this is a troubled space.

1594
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:20,280
[Randy] What happened two years ago,

1595
01:05:20,281 --> 01:05:22,372
was it something like this?

1596
01:05:22,373 --> 01:05:24,839
I don't wanna talk about that.

1597
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,939
[Randy] Okay.

1598
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:28,033
If you feel uncomfortable, that's fine.

1599
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,614
Thank you Izzy,

1600
01:05:31,615 --> 01:05:32,615
for talking to us.

1601
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:35,350
Okay.

1602
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:38,380
Okay.

1603
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:44,089
Okay. Hey, Austin is your
sound equipment okay?

1604
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:44,923
Yeah we're good.

1605
01:05:44,924 --> 01:05:47,239
You said, it got fucked up or something?

1606
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,589
Yeah, we had some interference,

1607
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,061
but I checked it all out,

1608
01:05:50,062 --> 01:05:50,895
we're good to go.

1609
01:05:50,895 --> 01:05:51,728
Okay, great, great, great.

1610
01:05:51,728 --> 01:05:52,561
Are you recording?

1611
01:05:52,562 --> 01:05:53,609
- [Rob] Recording.
- Okay.

1612
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:56,869
So, here we are at the camera

1613
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,729
that I set up in the hallway.

1614
01:05:58,730 --> 01:05:59,570
Battery is dead.

1615
01:05:59,571 --> 01:06:02,973
So, I'm just gonna do a
quick battery change here.

1616
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:09,359
And, once I get it on,

1617
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,279
I'm gonna scrub through
some of the footage to see

1618
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:15,239
if anything occurred

1619
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,639
during the time that we were in there.

1620
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,299
So, I'm just gonna jump
to the approximate time

1621
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:23,803
that we had that activity
in the other room.

1622
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:25,993
I'm looking for...

1623
01:06:25,994 --> 01:06:29,189
Holy shit, Izzy, come here.

1624
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:30,503
Look, look, look,

1625
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:34,280
did you see that orb?

1626
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:37,909
Did you see that?

1627
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,343
Rob, did you see that orb?

1628
01:06:39,344 --> 01:06:40,427
[Rob] Yeah.

1629
01:06:44,431 --> 01:06:46,418
(Wes gasping)
- Holy shit!

1630
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:47,629
(Wes claps)

1631
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:48,630
Oh my God!

1632
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:51,383
That was this door.

1633
01:06:51,384 --> 01:06:53,109
We were in that room

1634
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:54,389
and a door slammed, right?

1635
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:55,371
But that slammed.

1636
01:06:55,372 --> 01:06:57,304
Now, this is a different door.

1637
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:58,138
Izzy, Izzy,

1638
01:06:58,138 --> 01:06:58,971
come here, come here.

1639
01:06:58,972 --> 01:07:00,063
Is your infrared on?

1640
01:07:00,064 --> 01:07:00,897
[Rob] I can turn it on.

1641
01:07:00,898 --> 01:07:02,139
Turn on the infrared.

1642
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,889
Okay. Rob, I need you

1643
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,779
while you're looking at it. Right?

1644
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,559
You're also scanning for orbs.

1645
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,769
You saw that orb

1646
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:11,629
on the camera, right?

1647
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:12,590
- [Rob] Yeah.
- That's the kind of thing

1648
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:13,440
that you're looking for.

1649
01:07:13,441 --> 01:07:14,543
Izzy, how are you feeling?

1650
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:16,823
Rob, scan this room.

1651
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:18,230
See, if you can see anything.

1652
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,210
Okay.

1653
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:30,343
Izzy, do you feel anything?

1654
01:07:37,142 --> 01:07:38,159
No.
(whispers)

1655
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,089
No? What the fuck.

1656
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,439
Okay.

1657
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,449
Rob, with your infrared,

1658
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:44,669
I need you scanning,

1659
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,900
looking for...

1660
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:48,619
anything out of the ordinary,

1661
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,490
but there's these kinds of orbs.

1662
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:53,089
That's really what
you're looking for here.

1663
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:53,960
Izzy, here.

1664
01:07:53,961 --> 01:07:56,669
Let's also walk around, okay?

1665
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:57,720
You're our barometer.

1666
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,679
[Rob] What do we do if we find an orb?

1667
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,513
If you find an orb,

1668
01:08:02,514 --> 01:08:04,543
you let me know exactly where you saw it.

1669
01:08:14,987 --> 01:08:17,519
Izzy, are you getting anything?

1670
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,720
[Isabel] I don't know.

1671
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:22,620
[Wes] Relax into it.

1672
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:27,328
Wait, what?
- I don't feel anything.

1673
01:08:29,761 --> 01:08:30,761
[Rob] Wes?

1674
01:08:33,044 --> 01:08:34,044
What is it?

1675
01:08:35,843 --> 01:08:37,093
I don't know.

1676
01:08:38,962 --> 01:08:40,579
It looks like a camera.

1677
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:42,088
Is this one of ours?

1678
01:08:42,089 --> 01:08:43,802
[Rob] Nope. It's not one of mine.

1679
01:08:43,803 --> 01:08:45,969
Does it have a card in it?

1680
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:46,970
Yeah.

1681
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:49,713
What the fuck is it doing here?

1682
01:08:51,148 --> 01:08:51,981
Who would've done that?

1683
01:08:51,982 --> 01:08:53,239
It must be Geoff's right?

1684
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,026
He's the only one who's in here.

1685
01:08:56,027 --> 01:08:57,527
Why would Geoff put a camera there?

1686
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:01,370
He's watching us.

1687
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:04,210
[Randy] Where was it? Up here?

1688
01:09:04,211 --> 01:09:05,350
Yeah, it was right here.

1689
01:09:05,351 --> 01:09:06,238
It was right here,

1690
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:07,888
it was pointing right over there.

1691
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:11,709
It was pointed right here where

1692
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:17,459
all of the main activity happened. Right?

1693
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:20,749
Can we do a quick scan?

1694
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,306
Let's use your camera light here,

1695
01:09:22,307 --> 01:09:23,539
and do a quick scan

1696
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,359
to see if we find any more

1697
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,569
of these cameras.

1698
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:30,949
'Cause, if Geoff is watching us,

1699
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,113
I wanna know why?

1700
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:36,529
Hey everybody, we're downstairs now.

1701
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:40,149
And, we found another one of these cameras

1702
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:44,149
sitting here, hidden down on this outlet.

1703
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:47,509
And it's pointing at the
entrance of the building.

1704
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:49,419
We're gonna pop the card reader out

1705
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,419
and we're gonna take a
look at what's on this

1706
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,310
and the other camera

1707
01:09:52,311 --> 01:09:56,029
and see if there's anything interesting.

1708
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:58,669
A woman turned on this little camera

1709
01:09:58,670 --> 01:09:59,919
and she set it up

1710
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,449
and she positioned it on that ledge.

1711
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:03,899
And this is what the camera's filming.

1712
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,959
What it is that she's doing?

1713
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,089
Why she set up the camera?

1714
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:09,199
Where she is in the buil...

1715
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,783
Oh, there she is.

1716
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,570
So, this is the area
where those lockers are.

1717
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:25,039
So, this is the space
where everything happened,

1718
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,763
when we were up there.

1719
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:30,030
Okay, looks like she's coming now.

1720
01:10:34,707 --> 01:10:36,263
There she is.
(whispers)

1721
01:10:36,264 --> 01:10:37,118
[Isabel and Wes] Oh!

1722
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:38,951
[Wes] what the fuck?

1723
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:40,868
Holy shit!

1724
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:44,878
That was it.

1725
01:10:44,879 --> 01:10:45,712
[Wes] What?

1726
01:10:45,713 --> 01:10:46,729
That was it.

1727
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:48,401
[Wes] That was it?

1728
01:10:48,402 --> 01:10:49,402
Yeah.

1729
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:53,288
That had to be it.

1730
01:10:53,289 --> 01:10:54,929
That had to be it, what I felt.

1731
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:56,003
That's Geoff.

1732
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,383
Is that Geoff?

1733
01:11:00,187 --> 01:11:01,659
Oh, shit!

1734
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,560
Okay. I'm gonna put on the other card.

1735
01:11:05,245 --> 01:11:07,423
I mean, we're the only
ones allowed in here, right?

1736
01:11:08,299 --> 01:11:09,132
[Randy] Yeah.
(whispers)

1737
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:10,132
I mean, he...

1738
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:11,933
Yeah, that's right.

1739
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:15,749
Geoff said nobody else, nobody
else comes in here. Right?

1740
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,750
He said, nobody else is coming in here.

1741
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:20,969
We're scrubbing through,

1742
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:22,989
this is the lower level.

1743
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:25,049
But, why was she setting up cameras?

1744
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:26,030
I don't know.

1745
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:27,599
I mean, that's the question.

1746
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,999
Is she trying to...

1747
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,029
Is she looking for ghosts?

1748
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:32,253
Is she looking for him?

1749
01:11:33,464 --> 01:11:34,464
Fuck!

1750
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:40,560
Oh my God!
(gasps)

1751
01:11:40,561 --> 01:11:44,061
Geoff, what the fuck
are you goddamn doing?

1752
01:11:45,959 --> 01:11:47,564
Wes, we have to call the police.

1753
01:11:47,565 --> 01:11:49,184
[Randy] No, no, no, no police.

1754
01:11:49,185 --> 01:11:52,184
- [Wes] What?
- We have to call the police

1755
01:11:52,185 --> 01:11:53,018
What?

1756
01:11:53,019 --> 01:11:54,522
We call the police,
we're gonna lose the show...

1757
01:11:54,523 --> 01:11:55,356
Who gives a shit about the show?

1758
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:57,239
Whoa, whoa, Randy,

1759
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:58,240
she is right.

1760
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,379
We are absolutely going
to be calling the police.

1761
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:03,029
And we're gonna be turning over this,

1762
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:04,010
we're gonna be turning over

1763
01:12:04,011 --> 01:12:05,229
all of the footage that we have.

1764
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:08,293
This is a fucking crime scene man. Okay?

1765
01:12:09,812 --> 01:12:10,812
But, Izzy,

1766
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,539
it's also true that if we
call the police right now,

1767
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,373
they're gonna come,

1768
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:18,869
they're gonna lock up the building,

1769
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:20,419
and all of the darkness

1770
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,963
that exists in here right now,

1771
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:25,253
it's gonna stay.

1772
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,629
Whatever happened 12 years ago,

1773
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:31,839
whatever bad shit happened just now,

1774
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,487
it's gonna keep on happening.

1775
01:12:34,507 --> 01:12:35,999
Wes, I have never (whispers)

1776
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,609
Felt anything this strong.

1777
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:39,229
Like, not even two years ago,

1778
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,180
that was like nothing compared to this.

1779
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:45,700
I think we just call the police.

1780
01:12:49,711 --> 01:12:50,711
Izzy,

1781
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:52,363
I'm afraid,

1782
01:12:52,364 --> 01:12:53,897
that if we don't do something now,

1783
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:58,313
nobody's going to.

1784
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:02,303
Nobody's done anything
for the last 12 years.

1785
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:06,730
And once the police find out

1786
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:09,094
about whatever it is,

1787
01:13:09,095 --> 01:13:10,483
that's been happening in here.

1788
01:13:10,484 --> 01:13:13,411
We don't even know where it is.

1789
01:13:13,412 --> 01:13:15,490
We know where it is.

1790
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,836
It's in the fucking basement.

1791
01:13:18,837 --> 01:13:20,599
That's why he didn't want us down there.

1792
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,274
Did you get a hold of Geoff with the key?

1793
01:13:23,275 --> 01:13:24,455
- [Randy] Not yet.
- I don't think,

1794
01:13:24,456 --> 01:13:25,749
we wanna be talking to Geoff.

1795
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:26,819
I was just curious,

1796
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,723
if he came by with it.

1797
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,773
[Austin] I can just pick the lock.

1798
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:32,916
If you guys want.

1799
01:13:32,917 --> 01:13:34,959
You can pick locks?

1800
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:35,820
Yeah.

1801
01:13:35,821 --> 01:13:37,070
You can pick that lock?

1802
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,460
[Austin] I think so.

1803
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,653
Okay, then we pick the lock.

1804
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:49,359
We film it,

1805
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,943
and we cleanse this space,

1806
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:55,230
and then we turn everything
over to the cops.

1807
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:11,900
Got it.

1808
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:15,851
Okay.

1809
01:14:52,531 --> 01:14:54,395
Do you feel it?

1810
01:14:54,396 --> 01:14:55,229
Yeah.

1811
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:56,394
[Wes] Yeah?

1812
01:14:56,395 --> 01:14:57,511
It's here.

1813
01:14:57,512 --> 01:14:58,512
Okay.

1814
01:15:00,118 --> 01:15:02,535
(door bangs)

1815
01:15:04,923 --> 01:15:05,980
[Rob] Open it!

1816
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:08,501
(Wes banging the door)

1817
01:15:08,502 --> 01:15:12,533
(Wes grunting)
- Fuck! Come on

1818
01:15:12,534 --> 01:15:14,233
[Rob] Wes?

1819
01:15:14,234 --> 01:15:15,234
Shit!

1820
01:15:20,462 --> 01:15:23,379
(piano keys bangs)

1821
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:32,448
[Isabel] Wes.

1822
01:15:36,408 --> 01:15:37,241
Yeah.

1823
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:38,241
It's this way.

1824
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,840
Okay.

1825
01:15:43,727 --> 01:15:44,727
It's okay.

1826
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:50,444
Okay.

1827
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,781
It's here.
(sobbing)

1828
01:16:11,782 --> 01:16:12,782
In here?

1829
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:19,923
Can you shine your light in there?

1830
01:16:22,454 --> 01:16:24,020
[Isabel] You have to go in there.

1831
01:16:24,021 --> 01:16:24,977
[Wes] We have to go in there?

1832
01:16:24,978 --> 01:16:26,133
[Isabel] Yeah.

1833
01:16:26,134 --> 01:16:27,217
[Wes] Okay.

1834
01:16:29,078 --> 01:16:30,653
(Isabel weeping)

1835
01:16:30,654 --> 01:16:31,487
Okay, okay.

1836
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:32,320
Izzy, you're doing great,

1837
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,320
you're doing great.

1838
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:36,473
Okay, we find the spot.

1839
01:16:40,098 --> 01:16:40,931
It's right here.

1840
01:16:40,932 --> 01:16:42,493
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

1841
01:16:42,494 --> 01:16:43,327
Okay.

1842
01:16:43,327 --> 01:16:44,160
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

1843
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,140
Okay.

1844
01:16:45,141 --> 01:16:49,957
Spirit, we summon you to
commune with us in this space.

1845
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:52,090
(Isabel screaming)
(static crackling)

1846
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:56,175
Spirit, we invite you...

1847
01:16:56,176 --> 01:16:58,092
- Wes...
- We invite you

1848
01:16:58,093 --> 01:17:00,026
to communicate with us in this space.

1849
01:17:00,027 --> 01:17:01,885
(Isabel screaming)

1850
01:17:01,886 --> 01:17:03,174
Okay, okay.

1851
01:17:03,175 --> 01:17:05,675
Alright, let's go, let's go.

1852
01:17:09,926 --> 01:17:10,926
Izzy, Izzy.

1853
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:13,930
Turn it off.

1854
01:17:13,931 --> 01:17:17,170
Turn it off, okay.

1855
01:17:17,171 --> 01:17:18,912
Turn it off, okay.

1856
01:17:18,913 --> 01:17:20,562
Okay? Are you okay?

1857
01:17:20,563 --> 01:17:22,549
- Okay.
- All right, let's go.

1858
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:23,383
Where's Randy?

1859
01:17:23,383 --> 01:17:24,313
Hold on, hold on...

1860
01:17:24,314 --> 01:17:27,772
[Rob] Randy? Randy, come on we gotta go.

1861
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:28,863
[Austin] Where is he?

1862
01:17:28,864 --> 01:17:30,031
[Rob] Randy!

1863
01:17:30,945 --> 01:17:31,993
Randy!

1864
01:17:31,994 --> 01:17:33,410
[Isabel] We gotta go.

1865
01:17:33,411 --> 01:17:35,862
[Wes] Fuck, Rob, come on.

1866
01:17:35,863 --> 01:17:37,395
[Rob] Randy?

1867
01:17:37,396 --> 01:17:39,469
Fuck, is he really gone?

1868
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:41,303
- Randy!
- We gotta go.

1869
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:48,594
(loud bang)

1870
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,263
Go, go, go.

1871
01:17:52,729 --> 01:17:53,729
Fuck!

1872
01:18:00,663 --> 01:18:02,663
I think, it's in here.

1873
01:18:09,047 --> 01:18:11,297
Go back.
- Come on, come on.

1874
01:18:12,567 --> 01:18:14,191
[Rob] Shit.

1875
01:18:14,192 --> 01:18:16,192
This door is unlocked.

1876
01:18:20,257 --> 01:18:21,709
It's not fucking working.

1877
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:22,576
[Wes] Let me try.

1878
01:18:22,576 --> 01:18:23,576
[Rob] Fuck this.

1879
01:18:26,431 --> 01:18:28,605
[Austin] Where are you going?

1880
01:18:28,606 --> 01:18:29,888
[Rob] There's nothing here.

1881
01:18:29,889 --> 01:18:32,839
(Isabel grunting)

1882
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,376
Guys?

1883
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:36,032
(door closing)

1884
01:18:36,033 --> 01:18:38,950
- [Isabel] Rob.
- [Rob] Shit!

1885
01:18:38,951 --> 01:18:41,287
(Woman screaming)

1886
01:18:41,288 --> 01:18:42,320
Go, go.

1887
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:43,249
Run, run.

1888
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,414
Let's go.

1889
01:18:44,415 --> 01:18:46,401
(everyone shouting)

1890
01:18:46,402 --> 01:18:48,697
[Rob] She's behind us, just go!

1891
01:18:48,698 --> 01:18:52,529
(everyone screaming)

1892
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:53,730
[Wes] Rob, what did you see?

1893
01:18:57,010 --> 01:18:58,769
(door slams)

1894
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:00,191
Hold the door.

1895
01:19:00,192 --> 01:19:01,566
(Isabel screaming)

1896
01:19:01,567 --> 01:19:02,992
Hold the fucking door!

1897
01:19:05,382 --> 01:19:07,122
Okay, okay.

1898
01:19:07,123 --> 01:19:10,540
Let light rise, out of darkness!

1899
01:19:11,724 --> 01:19:14,589
Let light rise, out of darkness!

1900
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:15,423
(everyone screaming)

1901
01:19:15,424 --> 01:19:18,313
Let light rise, out of darkness!

1902
01:19:18,314 --> 01:19:20,029
Demon I banish you!

1903
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:23,138
Let light rise out of darkness!

1904
01:19:23,139 --> 01:19:25,089
I banish you!

1905
01:19:26,202 --> 01:19:28,203
Let light rise out of darkness.

1906
01:19:28,204 --> 01:19:29,204
(banging stops)

1907
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:31,639
Okay, let's go.

1908
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,242
Let's go, let's go.

1909
01:19:33,243 --> 01:19:35,049
(gun clicking)

1910
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:36,050
Shut up!

1911
01:19:37,155 --> 01:19:38,729
[Wes] Holy shit!

1912
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:40,522
Geoff, what the fuck?

1913
01:19:40,523 --> 01:19:41,629
What did I tell...

1914
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:43,299
Hey, don't play games.

1915
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,379
[Wes] I'm not playing games...

1916
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:45,213
Don't play games with me.

1917
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:47,409
What did I tell you?
- I swear to God,

1918
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:48,869
I'm not playing games...
- What did I tell you,

1919
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:50,569
there was nothing down here.

1920
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:52,079
What did you do?

1921
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,077
You disrespected me,

1922
01:19:53,078 --> 01:19:54,259
I'm the owner's manual,

1923
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:55,906
I let you in here!

1924
01:19:55,907 --> 01:19:56,740
Geoff, I'm so sorry.

1925
01:19:56,741 --> 01:19:58,169
I did not mean to disrespect...
- What were you doing

1926
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:59,607
in there?

1927
01:19:59,608 --> 01:20:00,580
You know what,

1928
01:20:00,581 --> 01:20:02,359
You made a mockery of me.

1929
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,509
You wanted to show,

1930
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:05,269
you brought these clowns in here

1931
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:07,009
to make a fucking show.

1932
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:07,950
- [Wes] I don't know...
- You better fucking

1933
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:08,783
keep recording,

1934
01:20:08,784 --> 01:20:09,989
'cause we got a show coming.

1935
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:11,759
You wanted show, you got it.

1936
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,279
But, I'm the fucking producer this time.

1937
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,399
Alright? I'm the producer.

1938
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,589
It's my show!

1939
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:18,239
- You're the producer.
- I'm the producer.

1940
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,239
Why aren't you fucking recording me?

1941
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,009
- You're the producer...
- You fucking asshole.

1942
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:22,843
I saw your attitude

1943
01:20:22,843 --> 01:20:23,676
when you walked in here,

1944
01:20:23,677 --> 01:20:24,909
you were making fun of me.

1945
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:26,109
[Wes] Geoff, Geoff!

1946
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:27,839
I own you guys now!

1947
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,673
[Wes] Geoff, just tell us,

1948
01:20:28,674 --> 01:20:29,852
what you need, man.

1949
01:20:29,853 --> 01:20:30,979
Just tell us what you need.

1950
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:32,605
We'll do whatever you want.

1951
01:20:32,606 --> 01:20:33,439
You wanted a show,

1952
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:34,272
that's what we're gonna do.

1953
01:20:34,273 --> 01:20:36,599
Get fucking moving, right now.

1954
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,600
- Okay.
- Get moving.

1955
01:20:37,601 --> 01:20:39,289
- Okay.
- Alright?

1956
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:41,419
15 minutes of shame starts right now.

1957
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:42,489
- You're the producer, man...
- Yeah, I'm ready

1958
01:20:42,490 --> 01:20:44,019
for my close-up.

1959
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:46,070
I've been ready for my close-up. Let's go.

1960
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:48,579
Wes, you're no hero.

1961
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:49,719
You're a fucking coward.

1962
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,339
You're a fake hero.

1963
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:52,366
You're a false idol.

1964
01:20:52,367 --> 01:20:53,719
[Wes] You're you're right, man.

1965
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,569
[Geoff] You're just
one big Facebook group.

1966
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:57,529
That's what I hate about Facebook.

1967
01:20:57,530 --> 01:20:59,749
[Wes] You're right, man. I'm so sorry.

1968
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:00,819
I'm sorry.

1969
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:01,853
[Geoff] Oh, hey.

1970
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,163
In here.

1971
01:21:04,164 --> 01:21:05,493
Where do you think you're going?

1972
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:07,984
You're driving around my place.

1973
01:21:07,985 --> 01:21:09,099
You all act like, you own the place

1974
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,519
What am I?
- You know, you're right.

1975
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,390
We're trying to follow your direction...

1976
01:21:12,391 --> 01:21:15,529
[Geoff] Isabel, this
is just ridiculous. Okay.

1977
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:16,363
Geoff, whatever you want...

1978
01:21:16,364 --> 01:21:18,939
Hey, right through there, come on.

1979
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,949
It's beautiful, come on.
- [Isabel] No!

1980
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:22,853
It's a great sound stage. Let's go.

1981
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,669
It's the scene of the crime.

1982
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:26,969
Hey Isabel, come on.

1983
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:29,499
You wanted show, what's your...

1984
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:30,450
Come on, Isabel.

1985
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:32,199
Hey, come on, come on.

1986
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,150
Just move the light on here.

1987
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:33,983
Let's help the sound guy.

1988
01:21:33,983 --> 01:21:34,920
Hey, is the sound okay?

1989
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:35,790
Yeah, it's fine.

1990
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:37,878
- Okay, great.
- [Isabel] Fuck!

1991
01:21:37,879 --> 01:21:38,969
So, Isabel, come on, come on.

1992
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:41,079
Let's save this for the show.

1993
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,369
You're giving away all your emotion.

1994
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:45,129
Like, you gotta teach
these guys everything.

1995
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:46,205
Come on, cameraman, come on...
- [Wes] Geoff, man,

1996
01:21:46,206 --> 01:21:47,039
you don't have to do this.

1997
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,129
[Geoff] This is going way too slow.

1998
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:49,289
- Geoff man you don't...
- [Geoff] too fucking slow!

1999
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:50,339
You don't have to do this, okay.

2000
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:51,340
Whatever you...

2001
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:54,119
No. We've got a show to do.

2002
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,179
- [Wes] Okay.
- Okay,

2003
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,100
enough bullshitting.

2004
01:21:56,101 --> 01:21:57,209
Let's slate.

2005
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:58,839
Come on, stop stuttering.

2006
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,673
What the fuck's your problem?

2007
01:21:59,674 --> 01:22:01,619
You're up there, you're
asking about the basement.

2008
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:02,550
Oh my God!

2009
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:03,809
You're a big show off.

2010
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:04,700
When the camera's on,

2011
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:05,620
you don't know how to shine,

2012
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,453
that's the problem.

2013
01:22:06,453 --> 01:22:07,286
Geoff, I'm ready.

2014
01:22:07,286 --> 01:22:08,119
I'll do the show, man.

2015
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:08,952
- [Geoff] Okay.
- Okay.

2016
01:22:08,952 --> 01:22:09,952
- [Geoff] Ready?
- Yes, yes.

2017
01:22:09,952 --> 01:22:10,930
[Geoff] And, action.

2018
01:22:10,931 --> 01:22:14,909
Okay. Hey everyone this
is Wes Wheatley here.

2019
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:16,219
Welcome back to "Infrared".

2020
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:17,456
We're here...

2021
01:22:17,457 --> 01:22:19,299
[Geoff] What did you
see? What did you find?

2022
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:20,133
What are you doing here?

2023
01:22:20,134 --> 01:22:22,349
Alright, We're here,

2024
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:23,449
at the Lincoln School.

2025
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:25,509
[Geoff] And, who introduced you here?

2026
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:26,343
We're here with Geoff,

2027
01:22:26,344 --> 01:22:27,789
who introduced us...
- Yeah!

2028
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:28,623
To the school.

2029
01:22:28,624 --> 01:22:30,399
He brought us down here for the show.

2030
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,199
And, so now, we're down here.

2031
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,190
We're doing this show

2032
01:22:33,191 --> 01:22:34,393
and Geoff is...

2033
01:22:35,813 --> 01:22:36,792
[Geoff] Oh man!

2034
01:22:36,793 --> 01:22:39,616
Geoff is here with us.

2035
01:22:39,617 --> 01:22:40,450
Cut, hold a sec.

2036
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:41,283
Yeah, man. Geoff is here with...

2037
01:22:41,283 --> 01:22:42,267
Hey, stop moving around,

2038
01:22:42,268 --> 01:22:44,393
you're like a ballerina.
- I'm so sorry.

2039
01:22:45,526 --> 01:22:46,719
Okay.

2040
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,029
Hey everyone, it's Wes Wheatley,

2041
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:51,409
we're here with a very
special episode of "Infrared".

2042
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:52,899
We're here with Geoff

2043
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:55,652
and he's let us down into
this really amazing space.

2044
01:22:55,653 --> 01:22:56,937
Shh, you hear that?

2045
01:22:56,938 --> 01:22:59,605
(Woman singing)

2046
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:01,983
Oh my God,

2047
01:23:01,983 --> 01:23:02,816
that melody is so beautiful.
(whispers)

2048
01:23:02,816 --> 01:23:03,816
Isabel, come in,

2049
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:05,736
come into the light.

2050
01:23:05,737 --> 01:23:07,713
Come in, you gotta hear this.

2051
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,384
Oh my God, they're marinating...

2052
01:23:13,385 --> 01:23:14,385
Okay?

2053
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:18,491
They're gonna be ready for the...

2054
01:23:18,492 --> 01:23:19,325
(Isabel crying)

2055
01:23:19,326 --> 01:23:20,709
- Okay.
- [Geoff] Okay?

2056
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:21,979
Yeah, yeah.

2057
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:23,384
Okay. Come in here.

2058
01:23:23,385 --> 01:23:24,285
Do you know why we're here?

2059
01:23:24,286 --> 01:23:25,569
Do you know why we're in this space?

2060
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:26,839
I don't know why we're in...

2061
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,319
Remember that story that I told you?

2062
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,062
Remember, you kept asking
the basement, what happened?

2063
01:23:32,063 --> 01:23:33,189
You were so interested...
- Yeah, yeah.

2064
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:34,759
This tragedy and my wife,

2065
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,453
you know what, this is where it happened.

2066
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:41,429
This is where the gas leak happened.

2067
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:42,263
He's gonna kill us.
(sobbing)

2068
01:23:42,264 --> 01:23:44,519
You see, that's the sign of a great show

2069
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,159
is you start with the emotion,

2070
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:46,993
you end with it.

2071
01:23:46,994 --> 01:23:49,032
You bookend it, you fucking bookend it.

2072
01:23:49,033 --> 01:23:50,945
You get the setup and the payoff.

2073
01:23:50,946 --> 01:23:51,800
- Yes!
- That's right.

2074
01:23:51,801 --> 01:23:53,339
Yes, Geoff-
- And now,

2075
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:56,540
you are gonna be part
of the most beautiful

2076
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:59,231
finale you've ever seen.

2077
01:23:59,232 --> 01:24:00,160
No...

2078
01:24:00,161 --> 01:24:02,599
Infrared is a fucking joke,

2079
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,409
compared to what this is gonna be.

2080
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:05,243
You're right.

2081
01:24:05,244 --> 01:24:06,509
- Okay?
- Yeah.

2082
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:07,343
You're right.

2083
01:24:07,343 --> 01:24:08,176
Why did you fucking move?

2084
01:24:08,177 --> 01:24:10,079
What are you shooting? Dirt?

2085
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,060
Let's get this over here.

2086
01:24:11,061 --> 01:24:13,179
Let's get us in a three shot. Come on.

2087
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:15,739
The new star, the movie stars.
(laughing)

2088
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:17,132
All =right, yeah man.

2089
01:24:17,133 --> 01:24:18,893
One final frame.

2090
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:22,270
- This is it...
- This is gonna be incredible.

2091
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,529
This is kind of tight.

2092
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:25,759
I see why you didn't like it.

2093
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,959
Come here, come on, come on.

2094
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,779
Guys, you can trust me.

2095
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:31,449
I'm the owner's manual.

2096
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:32,896
I gave you everything you wanted.

2097
01:24:32,897 --> 01:24:34,409
You wanted the basement,

2098
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:35,243
you got the basement.

2099
01:24:35,244 --> 01:24:36,559
Now, just come on.

2100
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,393
Come on.
- Okay.

2101
01:24:37,393 --> 01:24:38,226
We gotta move.

2102
01:24:38,226 --> 01:24:39,059
This is a slow.

2103
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:40,619
We've got run time here.

2104
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:41,899
Come on. Let's go.

2105
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,399
What are you shooting?

2106
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,609
That looks like shit.

2107
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:46,049
That's all green.

2108
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:47,699
- [Rob] It's infrared.
- We're not gonna get

2109
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:49,149
on a big show with this.

2110
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,909
This isn't a movie.

2111
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:52,239
Good lord!

2112
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:55,043
No, keep the camera on. Come on guys.

2113
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:58,713
You guys are...

2114
01:24:58,714 --> 01:24:59,859
This is gonna be fun.

2115
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:01,479
You guys got your show.

2116
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:02,929
This is the show.

2117
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:04,669
You guys look so scared.

2118
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:06,319
You guys don't take any creative risks.

2119
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,559
- Geoff.
- That's the problem.

2120
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,394
That's why the show hasn't worked.

2121
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:11,111
Geoff, just please man.

2122
01:25:11,112 --> 01:25:12,239
Yeah, we're going.

2123
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,751
Just please, what?

2124
01:25:13,752 --> 01:25:16,874
This is gonna be the
best show of your life.

2125
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:18,304
- No!
- Come on,

2126
01:25:18,305 --> 01:25:19,138
We're going here.

2127
01:25:19,139 --> 01:25:20,199
Just relax!

2128
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,909
Sometimes, what people want the most,

2129
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:23,830
you give it to them

2130
01:25:23,831 --> 01:25:26,296
and then they realize they don't want it.

2131
01:25:26,297 --> 01:25:28,719
(sobbing)
- Oh God!

2132
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,312
Geoff, you do not have to do this man.

2133
01:25:31,313 --> 01:25:32,280
[Geoff] You know what,

2134
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,113
Okay?

2135
01:25:33,114 --> 01:25:35,662
You should be calling me the producer.

2136
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:37,559
- [Wes] Okay.
- I'm not Geoff anymore,

2137
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,709
I'm the producer.

2138
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:40,809
Okay, you're the producer man.

2139
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:43,905
- Oh, this is...
- You don't have to do...

2140
01:25:43,906 --> 01:25:46,179
Whatever you have...
- Yes, I do.

2141
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:47,869
I gotta give you a show.

2142
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:50,003
I give people what they want.

2143
01:25:51,687 --> 01:25:53,509
Wes, the hero,

2144
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:54,979
I believed in you.

2145
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:56,809
I trusted you

2146
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:58,119
and I'm loyal to you.

2147
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:58,953
Now go.

2148
01:25:58,954 --> 01:26:01,269
This is gonna be the
greatest moment of your life.

2149
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:03,770
Man, people are gonna be wondering...

2150
01:26:03,771 --> 01:26:04,604
Let's go.

2151
01:26:04,605 --> 01:26:07,273
[Geoff] Nobody's gonna
ever fucking wonder.

2152
01:26:08,257 --> 01:26:10,179
Please, please, okay?

2153
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:11,681
You do not have to do this...

2154
01:26:11,682 --> 01:26:12,515
You're gonna take a nap.

2155
01:26:12,516 --> 01:26:14,099
You're upset.
- I swear to God, man.

2156
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,429
You're gonna need to relax.

2157
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:16,779
- I swear to God...
- So..

2158
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:18,509
- You do not have to...
- You know,

2159
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:19,783
you're gonna have to...

2160
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:22,809
I wanna tell your story, okay?

2161
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:23,829
I'm gonna tell your story.

2162
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:24,899
Now, sneak under here...

2163
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:26,629
We're gonna get this camera right.

2164
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:27,839
We're gonna do a little prep session.

2165
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,879
You're gonna go wait in here.
- Geoff.

2166
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,509
- This is your dressing room.
- Geoff.

2167
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:32,559
This is a real fucking show.

2168
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,450
- Geoff...
- Okay?

2169
01:26:33,451 --> 01:26:34,969
Please man, you do not have...

2170
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:36,699
I wanted to make a movie,

2171
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:37,570
you wanted to make a show,

2172
01:26:37,571 --> 01:26:39,069
now you've got a show, you're not happy.

2173
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:41,319
Get in there, it's your dressing room.

2174
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,099
- Please, man...
- Okay?

2175
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:44,799
There's some even good
food waiting for you.

2176
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,009
There's fillet mignon.

2177
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:47,310
[Rob] Just tell him to get in there

2178
01:26:47,311 --> 01:26:48,311
Just go!

2179
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:52,367
Please go!

2180
01:26:52,368 --> 01:26:55,720
Isabel, this is the greatest
moment of your life!

2181
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:58,619
This is your moment.

2182
01:26:58,620 --> 01:27:01,639
Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.

2183
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:04,049
This is gonna be a great movie. Okay guys.

2184
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:06,352
I will be back. Okay?

2185
01:27:06,353 --> 01:27:08,168
Give me five minutes.

2186
01:27:08,169 --> 01:27:10,268
(door banging)

2187
01:27:10,269 --> 01:27:12,051
(door closes)
(Isabel screaming)

2188
01:27:12,052 --> 01:27:13,219
[Isabel] No!

2189
01:27:14,818 --> 01:27:16,068
Knock, knock.

2190
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:18,783
Geoff.

2191
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,720
[Geoff] Say hi to my wife for me.

2192
01:27:20,721 --> 01:27:22,939
Geoff?
(door banging)

2193
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:23,773
Geoff?

2194
01:27:23,774 --> 01:27:25,732
[Rob] He's gone, he's fucking gone.

2195
01:27:27,074 --> 01:27:29,657
(door banging)

2196
01:27:30,685 --> 01:27:34,615
There's gotta be a way
to open this fucking door.

2197
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:39,616
(Woman singing)
(door banging)

2198
01:27:43,745 --> 01:27:47,278
(Geoff whistling)

2199
01:27:55,666 --> 01:28:00,133

2200
01:28:13,781 --> 01:28:16,614
(everyone screaming)
