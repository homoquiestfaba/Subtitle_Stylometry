00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:22,217
HITMAN: You gotta know what
you're doing when you go in.

2
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:25,007
You gotta have
it figured out.

3
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:28,297
Those are the rules.

4
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:39,569
How you get in,
how you get out,

5
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:41,359
how many shots
you're gonna need.

6
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,940
Make sure you know
where everybody is.

7
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:48,080
Make sure nobody sees you.

8
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,808
Don't hang around.

9
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:56,232
Don't get interested.

10
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,163
Then you
don't make mistakes.

11
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:16,011
[Phone ringing]

12
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:34,570
[Ringing]

13
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:43,978
Yeah.

14
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,197
MAN: How'd you like
to go to Detroit

15
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:47,569
and see a man in a hotel
Friday morning?

16
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:50,444
HITMAN:
I don't do that anymore.

17
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:53,545
MAN: I'll double your price.

18
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:55,497
You can do
whatever you want.

19
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:59,857
Can't hear you, chief.

20
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:01,833
I'm taking it
this guy in the hotel

21
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,264
is somebody you don't want
to look in the face.

22
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:07,375
I'm thinking maybe
it's the old man

23
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:10,346
with the big house
you want to move into.

24
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:12,973
Guy past his time,

25
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:14,703
and he don't like
how you do things.

26
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,365
Hey, fuck you.
I'll get somebody else.

27
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,054
You don't have
no somebody else.

28
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:21,993
You call me when your people
won't do it.

29
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:23,497
MAN: You want to leave it
all behind, chief,

30
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:25,197
here's your chance.

31
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:32,845
You have a Cadillac...
a blue one.

32
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:33,832
MAN: Yeah.

33
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:36,362
HITMAN:
Throw that in there,

34
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:37,713
you'll never see me
again.

35
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,121
MAN: You can collect your money
next Tuesday.

36
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:44,651
Union Station, usual place.

37
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:46,285
He'll have a girl with him.

38
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:47,533
She'll let you in.

39
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:13,515
HITMAN: Papa.

40
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,306
OLD MAN: Yeah?

41
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:17,713
You got somethin' for me?

42
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:20,554
HITMAN:
From your son-in-law.

43
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,716
OLD MAN: Oh, Christ.

44
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:29,002
I told my daughter,
"Don't marry that punk."

45
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:30,636
She don't listen.

46
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:32,813
I give him six months.

47
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:34,826
There'll be another funeral.

48
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:36,209
You want him done
sooner than that,

49
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:37,421
you tell me.

50
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:40,206
Who the hell are you?

51
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:41,869
You don't remember?

52
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:43,216
Should I?

53
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:45,641
You know
Walpole Island, Papa?

54
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,893
It's an Indian reserve.

55
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:49,037
My grandmother lives there.

56
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:50,733
She's a medicine woman.

57
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,601
She was going to turn me
into an owl one time.

58
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:57,491
I told her,
"I don't want to be no owl.

59
00:03:57,523 --> 00:03:59,760
I want to be a blackbird."

60
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:01,737
That's how I got my name.

61
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:03,689
Blackbird.

62
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:04,844
You remember now.

63
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:06,705
The Degas brothers,

64
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,016
one killed working for you,

65
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:10,440
shot dead in the hospital,

66
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,818
the other one doing life
in Kingston.

67
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:14,510
I'm the only one left.

68
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:19,688
Huh.

69
00:04:20,948 --> 00:04:22,922
Can she do that?

70
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:24,654
Turn you into an owl?

71
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:26,763
If she want to.

72
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:29,422
I could use
a woman like that.

73
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:42,417
I'd like to be dressed.

74
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:44,012
Is that okay with you?

75
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:46,578
Whatever you want.

76
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:18,192
WOMAN: Are you through?

77
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:19,176
Not yet.

78
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:23,920
# My, my #

79
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:28,013
# Little white lies #

80
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:32,361
# Swear I'm gonna
make it right #

81
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:35,665
# This time #

82
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,758
# Start the radio #

83
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:43,789
# Turn it way down low #

84
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:48,529
# Tellin' me things
I do not know #

85
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:51,378
# I know #

86
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:56,780
And it could be used equally
as a recreation room or a den.

87
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,063
WOMAN BUYER:
Look in here, Dan.

88
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:00,434
AGENT: Quite a lovely,
distinctive entrance hall,

89
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:04,428
which is so practical
and elegant, don't you think?

90
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,777
Thank you.

91
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:22,799
# Now who's to blame? #

92
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:24,777
# You used to be the same #

93
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,470
MAN: Wayne! Foreman!

94
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:31,337
WAYNE: What?!

95
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:33,484
What?!

96
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,359
# It's a suicide #

97
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:39,053
MAN: And don't bother
comin' back!

98
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:42,058
# Shut up and drive #

99
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:46,162
RICHIE: Mrs. Palino.

100
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:47,821
Richie Nix.

101
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:50,707
You were my foster mom
for a while.

102
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:52,910
I had a collection
of old Elvis vinyls

103
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:54,441
I left here a while back.

104
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:56,818
My girlfriend,
she's a big Elvis fan.

105
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:57,898
We thought we'd come by
and, uh,

106
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,019
pick 'em up from you.

107
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:02,834
Last time I saw you,
you drove off in my car.

108
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:06,096
Go fuck off
before I call the police.

109
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,445
# Tonight you will be mine #

110
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:11,563
WOMAN: It's okay.

111
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:20,402
# Tonight the monkey dies #

112
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:43,274
# Tonight you will be mine #

113
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:48,017
# Tonight the monkey dies #

114
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:12,242
If you're lookin' for
your grandmother, she's gone.

115
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:15,177
We buried her last winter.

116
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:33,200
WAYNE: Gonna spend
a few weeks huntin' deer.

117
00:08:33,235 --> 00:08:36,366
LIONEL: Be sure and pour
some of this stuff on ya.

118
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:37,516
Here.

119
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:39,082
Thanks.

120
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:40,781
Wayne?

121
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:41,833
Yeah?

122
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,631
You lookin'
for another job?

123
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:44,616
I don't know.

124
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:45,968
Try my hand
at real estate maybe.

125
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:48,687
Put you in an office
and a suit.

126
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:49,901
Ha ha! You bet!

127
00:08:57,363 --> 00:08:59,534
Hey, Lionel.

128
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:00,815
Where's your cane?

129
00:09:03,155 --> 00:09:05,227
I'm sorry
about your grandmother.

130
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:08,528
The band office
has been trying to locate

131
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:09,807
the next of kin

132
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:11,916
to find out what to do
with her house.

133
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:13,515
Hey, I been thinking.

134
00:09:15,283 --> 00:09:17,771
When I get paid
for this job I done,

135
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:19,950
maybe I could fix
the place up.

136
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:21,776
You could sell it
the way it is.

137
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,600
No, I mean fix it up
and live here.

138
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:26,479
A guy like you,

139
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:28,009
used to living
in the city?

140
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:30,385
There's no life
for you here.

141
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:35,122
I could always be
a friendly Indian like you,

142
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:36,497
maybe even a guide.

143
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:39,309
You wouldn't like it.

144
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:41,070
Why not? You do.

145
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:43,246
Hey, Lionel,

146
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,810
come on, you telling me
I can't live here?

147
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:50,730
Hey, you ever ride
in a Cadillac?

148
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:52,560
Come on. We'll take a drive.

149
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:54,505
Go to Algonac,
have some drink.

150
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,805
You go.

151
00:09:57,843 --> 00:09:59,599
I got to go home.

152
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:17,967
WAYNE: Hey.

153
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:18,896
Hi.

154
00:10:18,963 --> 00:10:21,549
WAYNE: Didn't let myself in.

155
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:23,506
Right.

156
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,513
Which is kind of weird.

157
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:38,380
CARMEN: Well,
I made a start.

158
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:41,875
I thought I'd leave
the hunting things for you.

159
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:45,100
Okay.

160
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,484
CARMEN: Well, the guns
I understand,

161
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:55,694
but why the suit?

162
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:57,771
You gonna rob a bank?

163
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:59,534
You mind if I leave
some of this stuff here

164
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:01,611
till next time?

165
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:03,756
What's this?

166
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:04,743
Buck lure.

167
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,584
Oh! God,
that smells like hell.

168
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:10,895
Not to a buck it don't.

169
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:15,249
So when is next time?

170
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:16,559
Tomorrow after work?

171
00:11:16,595 --> 00:11:17,839
Could be
anytime tomorrow.

172
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,762
What happened
to 350 Jefferson?

173
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:21,486
They want to put me
on a detail gang

174
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:23,378
on the ground.

175
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:26,321
I said no.

176
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,643
That's an old man's job.

177
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:36,618
# It hurts me
to see him treat you #

178
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,978
# The way that he does #

179
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:46,728
# It hurts me to see you
sit and cry #

180
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:52,168
# When I know
I could be so true #

181
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:56,302
# If I had someone like you #

182
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,951
# It hurts me
to see those tears... #

Pine Ridge was

200
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,280

let him know
what you're thinking.

by surprise.

suit or something?

00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:25,099
The window damages...

360
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:26,600
OFFICER: And you didn't know
these guys?

361
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:27,787
No, sir.

362
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:30,281
'Cause nobody witnessed
you arriving separately.

363
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:32,264
CARMEN: Wait just a minute.

364
00:23:32,306 --> 00:23:33,648
They shot at my husband.

365
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:35,406
He probably saved my life.

366
00:23:35,442 --> 00:23:38,192
Mr. Colson, you knew nothing
about these blackmail calls?

367
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:40,113
Hey, I don't know
about any calls.

368
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:41,128
What blackmail calls?

369
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:45,615
There were some calls
last week. Uh, creeps.

370
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,690
I told the police.

371
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,224
But not us?

372
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:51,754
Those creeps
had guns, Nelson.

373
00:23:51,794 --> 00:23:52,971
WAYNE: Asshole.

374
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,122
Wayne.

375
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:56,495
CARMEN: Asshole.

376
00:24:01,586 --> 00:24:03,626
RICHIE: I'm bleedin'
somethin' fierce here, man.

377
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,706
Let's just go to Marine City.
I want to see Donna.

378
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:07,502
Who the fuck is Donna?

379
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:09,164
She's this woman
that I'm stayin' with.

380
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:11,275
She's cool, man.
I told her about you.

381
00:24:11,314 --> 00:24:13,965
It's on the way
to Port Huron.

382
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:16,107
My brothers and I
come up here one time

383
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:17,292
to kill a guy.

384
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,330
No shit. What'd he do?

385
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,647
I didn't ask.

386
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:26,761
That doesn't
make sense to me.

387
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:29,519
I gotta be pissed at a guy
I want to kill him.

388
00:24:30,866 --> 00:24:32,491
Bird, why didn't you shoot him?

389
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,504
He was standin' right there
in the fuckin' window.

390
00:24:34,546 --> 00:24:36,072
You want to learn somethin'?

391
00:24:36,114 --> 00:24:38,503
The only time
you ever take out your gun

392
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:40,007
is when you're gonna
kill somebody.

393
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,904
Yeah? Well,
you could've right there!

394
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,825
It's the same as a hunter.

395
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,549
The guy who knows
what he's doing,

396
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:49,416
he don't take the shot
if he thinks he can miss.

397
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:52,807
See, then you gotta find
the animal and finish it,

398
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,962
two of them.

399
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:56,655
Are you talkin'
about the woman now?

400
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,697
What'd that woman do?

401
00:24:58,738 --> 00:25:01,194
She saw my face.

402
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:03,143
You don't
ever leave things undone.

403
00:25:03,186 --> 00:25:04,201
You don't ever think

404
00:25:04,242 --> 00:25:06,446
somebody's not going
to remember you.

405
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,814
LIONEL: Some people were askin'
after you this mornin'.

406
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,443
BLACKBIRD: What people?

407
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:26,127
Said they were friends
of yours from Toronto.

408
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:28,333
What'd you tell them?

409
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,686
I told them
I hadn't seen you in years.

410
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,578
You see
my friend's face, Lionel?

411
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,269
Fell off a ladder.

412
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:38,193
Got cut up,
couldn't go to work.

413
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:41,575
So I said, "Hey,
let's go duck hunting."

414
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:43,244
You free to take us?

415
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:47,688
Weather's supposed to turn.

416
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,934
Why don't we go anyway?

417
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,075
Richie's never seen
a marsh before.

418
00:25:52,114 --> 00:25:53,575
I've seen a marsh.

419
00:25:57,746 --> 00:25:59,273
Come on, Lionel.

420
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:02,663
This won't take long.

421
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:23,721
You okay?

422
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:26,250
I... guess so.

423
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,395
That Indian guy freaked me out.

424
00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:29,644
Walk you in?

425
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:33,000
CARMEN: So what things
are you looking at?

426
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:34,024
WAYNE: Huh?

427
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,081
Back there with the police,

428
00:26:35,122 --> 00:26:37,293
you said you were
looking at other things?

429
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,177
Yeah, well,
I'm lookin' at anything.

430
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,032
You said it.
I'm a dinosaur.

431
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,627
I gotta change or die.

432
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,226
I never said that.

433
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:47,153
Then I'm sayin' it.

434
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:49,607
So today's the day
you decide to come in

435
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,926
about a job in real estate?

436
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,294
What? I could sell a house.

437
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,534
Absolutely.

438
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,220
Anyway, thank God
you showed up in that suit.

439
00:26:58,258 --> 00:27:00,560
Yeah, dangerous suit.

440
00:27:00,594 --> 00:27:02,449
Got married in it,
got shot at in it.

441
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:04,816
Well, you look great in it.

442
00:27:06,514 --> 00:27:08,685
Anyway, thanks.

443
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:11,082
Anytime.

444
00:27:16,881 --> 00:27:17,830
Wayne?

445
00:27:21,714 --> 00:27:23,241
It's a deer.

446
00:27:23,282 --> 00:27:25,486
Get some rest.

447
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:28,140
You need anything,
just call the Hillcrest Motel.

448
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,177
RICHIE:
I don't see any birds.

449
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:40,941
LIONEL:
You want to hunt ducks?

450
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:43,150
You watch the sky.

451
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:48,812
It looks different,
all this water.

452
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,825
LIONEL: Maybe you never
came down this far,

453
00:27:50,866 --> 00:27:52,622
you and your brothers.

454
00:27:52,657 --> 00:27:56,040
There are no cats or dogs
around here to shoot.

455
00:27:57,938 --> 00:28:01,004
Last time I saw you,
you were going hunting

456
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:05,165
with some guy
in a ironworker's jacket.

457
00:28:05,202 --> 00:28:07,503
Seemed like a nice guy.

458
00:28:07,538 --> 00:28:09,480
What was his name?

459
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:11,818
Carl.

460
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,800
Wayne.

461
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:15,532
You can't remember the rest,

462
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,287
we'll go back and ask
your wife and daughter.

463
00:28:22,098 --> 00:28:23,724
Wayne Colson.

464
00:28:23,762 --> 00:28:25,136
Where does he live?

465
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:27,440
Algonac.

466
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:29,132
Is he married?

467
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,781
Kids?

468
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:33,931
They couldn't.

469
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,857
Hey, there's some!

470
00:28:40,882 --> 00:28:44,427
Looks like you're gonna
have trouble with this one.

471
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:46,375
He might shoot
the wrong bird.

472
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:49,160
What's that supposed to mean?

473
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,479
Ducks don't land in trees.

474
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,723
Why don't we go over there,
stretch our legs?

475
00:29:27,506 --> 00:29:28,815
Want to go first?

476
00:30:06,353 --> 00:30:08,012
You know,
you really piss me off!

477
00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:12,361
Tell me ducks
don't land in trees?

478
00:30:12,402 --> 00:30:14,060
Aah!

479
00:30:14,098 --> 00:30:15,952
I know ducks
don't land in trees.

00:30:31,057 --> 00:30:32,879
RICHIE: Bird, you comin'?

482
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:52,297
WOMAN: Excuse me.

483
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:56,230
Uh...

484
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:57,702
This is my house.

485
00:31:00,082 --> 00:31:01,511
Uh, yeah.

486
00:31:01,554 --> 00:31:04,107
It's a dump.

487
00:31:04,146 --> 00:31:05,837
You certainly have
your nerve.

488
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:08,456
RICHIE: Donna... ahem.

489
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:12,075
Donna, this is the Bird.

490
00:31:12,114 --> 00:31:13,902
He's gonna be stayin'
with us for a few days.

491
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,182
What happened to your face?

492
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:16,875
I got in a fight.

493
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:19,248
We got any beers?

494
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:21,518
Well, why don't you fix us
somethin' to eat,

495
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:22,568
and I'll go get some.

496
00:31:27,026 --> 00:31:30,670
Hey, don't call me
Bird no more.

497
00:31:30,706 --> 00:31:32,113
Why?

498
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:33,487
What do you
want me to call you?

499
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:36,331
My name.

500
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,646
Armand.

501
00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:40,103
Ar-mand? Armand?

502
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:42,317
Are you serious?

503
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:46,896
Listen...

504
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:50,859
when she's makin'
all that fuckin' noise in there,

505
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:52,304
it means she's pissed off.

506
00:31:52,338 --> 00:31:54,225
Why don't you go in there,

507
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:55,752
give her a little pat
on the ass, huh?

508
00:32:11,953 --> 00:32:14,342
You want the Weight Watchers
chicken patty or the regular?

509
00:32:14,385 --> 00:32:17,768
Mmm...
two Weight Watchers, please.

510
00:32:20,753 --> 00:32:23,503
Richie said you used to be
a hack in the joint.

511
00:32:24,753 --> 00:32:26,761
That how you met?

512
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:28,941
I was in catering services.

513
00:32:28,978 --> 00:32:32,011
Said you got fired
for screwin' the inmates.

514
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:37,709
You drive
that school bus out there?

515
00:32:43,218 --> 00:32:45,706
Hey, if you could be
any kind of a bird there is...

516
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,688
what kind of bird would you be?

517
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:54,255
What are you doing here?

518
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,016
Just need a place to stay.

519
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:00,170
For how long?

520
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:03,051
Couple of days.

521
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:04,845
Got some business
to take care of.

522
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,231

with your chicken patties?

Sure.
Oh, it's my pleasure.

526
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:47,403
I was busy, but, uh...

527
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,272
Well, I dragged myself away
from starin' at the ceiling.

528
00:33:52,305 --> 00:33:54,891
Well, anyway,
it turned out to be nothing.

529

I'm so jumpy. I'm sorry.

530
00:33:56,882 --> 00:33:58,256
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

No, no. Go to bed.

00:33:59,473 --> 00:34:01,196
I'll grab a beer,
at least till you're asleep.

00:34:01,234 --> 00:34:02,543
Well, there's really no need.

534
00:34:02,577 --> 00:34:06,855
Oh. Well, now you're not
scared, I can't have a beer.

535
00:34:06,898 --> 00:34:08,425

even have keys to the house.

I thought you called me.

538
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,159
I did call you,
and I am nervous,

539
00:34:14,193 --> 00:34:16,528
but if you can just let yourself
in whenever you want...

540
00:34:16,561 --> 00:34:17,489
Which I've never done.

541
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:18,601
But you could.

542
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,878
I don't know.
I know you've been here.

543
00:34:20,913 --> 00:34:21,895
Yeah, but not when you were here.

544
00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:23,563
So you <i>have been here.</i>

545
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:25,008
I fixed the porch light.

546
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,896
Carmen, I waited
till you'd gone out

547
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,620
so as not to get into a fight.

548
00:34:28,658 --> 00:34:29,901
Which means
you were watching me,

549
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:31,880
which might be why I'm
feeling watched all the time.

550
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:32,849
Come on!

551
00:34:32,881 --> 00:34:34,059
All right, you know what?

552
00:34:34,097 --> 00:34:36,301
I'm thankful to you
for fixing the porch light.

553
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:37,832
Yeah, and that faucet
in the bathroom.

554
00:34:37,873 --> 00:34:39,335
And the faucet
in the bathroom, too.

555
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,320
But this was supposed
to be a change.

556
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:43,216
Nothing's changing.

557
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,864
Wayne, I'm moving.

558
00:34:48,497 --> 00:34:50,602
I don't like
being this person

559
00:34:50,642 --> 00:34:53,260
who's blaming you for all
the things I'm blaming you for.

560
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:58,128
You know, there's no, uh...
middle, huh?

561
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:00,333
I mean, this is it with you.

562
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:01,482
You're either fine,

563
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:02,765
or you are leavin'
the country.

564
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:05,168
We don't have kids, fine.

565
00:35:05,202 --> 00:35:06,795
We can't have kids, fine.

566
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,703
No, suddenly,
we are killin' ourselves.

567
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:11,207
We are gettin' a divorce.

568
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:12,908
We are leavin' the country.

569
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:16,491
I mean,
it's like it's zero or ten.

570
00:35:16,529 --> 00:35:18,700
I mean, what happened to five?

571
00:35:18,738 --> 00:35:20,876
Five's pretty great.

572
00:35:20,914 --> 00:35:22,888
I'll take five again
in a fuckin' minute.

573
00:35:25,745 --> 00:35:26,923
RICHIE: See?
What I tell you?

574
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:29,001
He's fuckin' that woman
from the real estate office.

575
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:51,473
I got him!

576
00:35:51,505 --> 00:35:52,749
You get the woman!

577
00:35:59,697 --> 00:36:01,934
[Ringing]

578
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:03,857
CARMEN: Hello.

579
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:05,296
- It's me.
- Mom.

580
00:36:12,977 --> 00:36:15,017
Oh, ask me something else.

581
00:36:15,057 --> 00:36:16,967
How are you? How are you?

582
00:36:21,425 --> 00:36:22,603
Oh, he's out. He'll be back.

583
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:23,983
LENORE: You know,
I went to see

584
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:25,741
that doctor again
this afternoon.

585
00:36:25,777 --> 00:36:27,817
I told him those pills
don't agree with me at all.

586
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:30,224
Hey, Mom,
I have to call you back.

587
00:36:49,105 --> 00:36:50,534
BLACKBIRD:
You going hunting, miss?

588
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:54,414
I was looking
for your husband,

589
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:55,594
have a talk with him.

590
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:56,615
He's not home.

591
00:36:58,193 --> 00:36:59,469
I know that.

592
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:01,894
I was wondering maybe
I'd come inside and wait.

593
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:07,049
We met before, remember?
At the real estate office.

594
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:14,890
You going to shoot me?

595
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:18,668
The police should be here
any minute.

596
00:37:18,705 --> 00:37:21,007
Oh, you had time
to call them, huh?

597
00:37:23,633 --> 00:37:25,673
I don't think
you're going to shoot me.

598
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:43,528
Hi.

599
00:37:53,745 --> 00:37:54,858
Ohh!

600
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,679
All right!
It's your big day, honey!

601
00:37:57,713 --> 00:37:58,891
It's a double feature!

602
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:00,816
Get out the cash tray,
lay it on the counter.

603
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:03,304
And some gum.
Make that bubblegum.

604
00:38:03,345 --> 00:38:04,425
Do it!

605
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:13,899
Get out of there!

606
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:14,885
Get the hell
out of there!

607
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:43,725
Fuck!

608
00:38:59,857 --> 00:39:01,002
Fuck.

609
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:18,057
Get up.

610
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:25,776
Are you Indian?

611
00:39:27,538 --> 00:39:28,715
You look Indian.

612
00:39:28,753 --> 00:39:30,476
You know, you should do
somethin' with your hair.

613
00:39:30,513 --> 00:39:32,652
Use a shampoo
with conditioner in one.

614
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,729
Give it some body.

615
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:35,717
Look at me.

616
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:40,045
Are you sure
you're not Indian?

617
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:44,588
Oh, well, doesn't matter.

618
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:49,357
WAYNE: How many times
are you gonna ask me,

619
00:39:49,393 --> 00:39:51,281
"Did I see him
shoot the girl?"

620
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:56,202
I thought she'd gotten
out of there!

621
00:39:57,713 --> 00:39:58,280
How many times
are you gonna go

622
00:39:58,673 --> 00:40:01,291
look at that bullet hole
in the tree?

623
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:04,144
My wife told you that she
wasn't tryin' to hit him,

624
00:40:04,177 --> 00:40:05,965
and you guys act like
you don't believe her!

625
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:08,652
Not one of you guys
has said, "Nice goin',"

626
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:10,828
or that was brave thing
my wife did!

627
00:40:11,857 --> 00:40:13,799
These maniacs
are tryin' to kill us,

628
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:15,368
and what are you
doin' about it?

629
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:17,643
Mr. Colson?

630
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:18,826
Mrs. Colson.

631
00:40:18,865 --> 00:40:22,094
I'm Paul Scallen,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

632
00:40:23,281 --> 00:40:24,688
WAYNE: That's the same color
as the guy's car.

633
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:27,471
A big goddamn Cadillac
nobody can seem to find.

634
00:40:27,505 --> 00:40:29,993
Oh, we found it
on Walpole Island.

635
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:32,139
Only there wasn't
a lot of paintwork left.

636
00:40:32,177 --> 00:40:35,243
Mr. Colson, do you know
a Lionel Adam?

637
00:40:36,306 --> 00:40:38,029
Yeah, sure.

638
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:39,821
Well, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

639
00:40:43,313 --> 00:40:45,899
Would you mind telling us who
the hell these assholes are now

640
00:40:45,937 --> 00:40:48,239
and why would they want
to kill Lionel Adam?

641
00:40:48,273 --> 00:40:49,680
SCALLEN:
We don't know for sure.

642
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,982
We think they were
trying to find you.

643
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:53,927
It seems you and your wife
had a good look at them.

644
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:55,595
WAYNE: So what?

645
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:57,095
All they were doin'
at that point

646
00:40:57,137 --> 00:40:59,177
was shakin' down
a real estate business.

647
00:40:59,217 --> 00:41:01,322
SCALLEN:
This one maybe, but...

648
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:02,605
this one's
got more of a history.

649
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:04,135
His name's Armand Degas.

650
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:05,803
He's known as The Blackbird.

651
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:09,005
He's a contract killer
for the Toronto Mafia.

652
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:11,180
Takes an awful lot of nerve
to stand up to a man like that.

653
00:41:11,217 --> 00:41:13,705
What does the Toronto Mafia
have to do with us?

654
00:41:13,745 --> 00:41:14,793
Last week,
the head of the family

655
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,459
was shot dead
in a Detroit hotel room,

656
00:41:16,497 --> 00:41:18,985
along with a girl
who might have seen it happen.

657
00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:20,585
We think it was an inside job.

658
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:21,770
And thanks to you,

659
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:24,591
we know that Degas
was in the area at the time.

660
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,697
So if we can, uh,
pick him up,

661
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:27,914
even if it's
just for extortion,

662
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:29,807
there's a chance that
he may want to cut a deal.

663
00:41:29,841 --> 00:41:31,368
WAYNE: Wait.

664
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:34,311
You want us to testify
against a Mafia hitman?

665
00:41:34,353 --> 00:41:37,255
He's gonna come
after you either way.

666
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:41,129
Without you, there's nothing
to say he was even here.

667
00:41:41,169 --> 00:41:42,958
WAYNE:
So what do you suggest?

668
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:45,353
Well, your lives
are in danger,

669
00:41:45,393 --> 00:41:47,564
so we figure you qualify
for federal protection

670
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:49,095
under the Witness
Security Program.

671
00:41:53,265 --> 00:41:55,632
You want to move us
someplace else?

672
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:57,127
SCALLEN: Until we find them.

673
00:41:57,169 --> 00:41:59,308
We'll provide you
with new identities,

674
00:41:59,345 --> 00:42:01,167
temporary employment.

675
00:42:01,201 --> 00:42:03,535
You won't need
to sell the house.

676
00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:05,423
I'm sure we can make a deal
with this Nelson Davies,

677
00:42:05,457 --> 00:42:07,562
have his company appear
to offer it for sale.

678
00:42:27,665 --> 00:42:28,811
Yeah?

679
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:29,797
BLACKBIRD: It's me.

680
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:33,288
Why the fuck
are you callin' me here?

681
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:34,277
BLACKBIRD: I need a car.

682
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:36,077
A clean one with papers.

683
00:42:36,113 --> 00:42:38,284
MAN: Word is,
you really upset the man.

684
00:42:38,321 --> 00:42:40,263
He was fuckin' that girl
you blew away.

685
00:42:40,305 --> 00:42:42,214
BLACKBIRD:
Can you arrange it or not?

686
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:44,264
You can't come here.

687
00:42:44,305 --> 00:42:46,345
They got everyone
lookin' for you.

688
00:42:52,561 --> 00:42:54,568
FBI AGENT: We'll transfer
your baggage overnight.

689
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:57,391
Replacement vehicles will be
waiting for you in the morning.

690
00:42:57,425 --> 00:42:58,473
Your own will be held

691
00:42:58,513 --> 00:43:00,007
until you're released
from the program.

692
00:43:00,049 --> 00:43:01,544
WAYNE: Never hear about that,
do you?

693
00:43:01,585 --> 00:43:03,145
People gettin'
out of witness protection?

694
00:43:03,185 --> 00:43:05,935
Destination location
is Cape Girardeau.

695
00:43:05,969 --> 00:43:07,463
That's about
another 2-hour drive

696
00:43:07,505 --> 00:43:09,196
south down the Mississippi River.

697
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:12,103
Now, you'll be checking in here
under your new names.

698
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:17,328
You must be Pam Benkowski.

699
00:43:19,217 --> 00:43:21,453
I'm your husband Matt.

700
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:39,686
FEMALE FBI AGENT:
It's best to stick

701
00:43:39,729 --> 00:43:41,289
as close
to the truth as possible.

702
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:42,890
That way, you're less
likely to have trouble

703
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:44,139
with your invented histories.

704
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:48,140
How long you been married?

705
00:43:48,177 --> 00:43:49,104
WAYNE: 15 years.

706
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:50,511
AGENT: Where'd you meet?

707
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,399
WAYNE: On a building site
in Saint Auburn.

708
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:55,215
June 4, 1991.

709
00:43:55,249 --> 00:43:56,656
AGENT:
Who asked who out first?

710
00:43:56,689 --> 00:43:57,737
CARMEN: I did.

711
00:43:57,777 --> 00:44:00,013
How long after that
were you married?

712
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:01,031
A week.

713
00:44:01,073 --> 00:44:02,829
How many children?

714
00:44:04,657 --> 00:44:06,217
Almost one.

715
00:44:11,505 --> 00:44:12,617
RICHIE: Well, if they moved,

716
00:44:12,657 --> 00:44:14,184
how come all their furniture's
still here?

717
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,779
Hey, Bird.

718
00:44:20,817 --> 00:44:22,344
What?

719
00:44:23,313 --> 00:44:25,135
You gonna kill Donna, too?

720
00:44:28,305 --> 00:44:29,515
I mean, you're goin'
to all this trouble

721
00:44:29,553 --> 00:44:31,495
findin' witnesses,
and she's a witness.

722
00:44:31,537 --> 00:44:33,326
What does that make you?

723
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,713
No, you need me.

724
00:44:36,753 --> 00:44:39,404
Leave my fingerprints
everywhere.

725
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,869
Steal cars and shoot people,

726
00:44:40,913 --> 00:44:41,861
do all your dirty work
for you.

727
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:48,078
[Phone ringing]

728
00:44:54,897 --> 00:44:56,359
Who is it?

729
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:59,750
Uh, yes, ma'am,
I'm looking for Wayne Colson.

730
00:44:59,793 --> 00:45:02,510
Who gave you my number?

731
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:03,690
Excuse me, ma'am.

732
00:45:03,729 --> 00:45:05,071
That was a new fella
works here

733
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:06,185
I just asked to call you.

734
00:45:06,224 --> 00:45:07,980
We been tryin'
to get ahold of Wayne,

735
00:45:08,017 --> 00:45:10,505
and, uh, he gave us
this number before he left.

736
00:45:10,545 --> 00:45:12,912
He gave you my number?

737
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:15,432
Well, as a matter of fact,
he gave it to the boss.

738
00:45:15,472 --> 00:45:16,716
Boss gave it to me.

739
00:45:16,753 --> 00:45:18,760
Only he isn't here right now
'cause it's so late,

740
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,550
but, uh, he said that
you'd know where he was.

741
00:45:21,584 --> 00:45:22,730
Wayne, that is.

742
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:24,492
LENORE: I don't know
where they've gone.

743
00:45:24,529 --> 00:45:26,416
Wayne and my daughter
never tell me anything.

744
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:29,710
RICHIE: See, 'cause I got this
check I'm tryin' to send him.

745
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,109
Yeah. Yes.

746
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:49,391
FBI AGENT: Mr. Benkowski.

747
00:45:49,424 --> 00:45:52,174
Mrs. Benkowski.
Good morning. Welcome.

748
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:53,136
- Morning.
- Hello.

749
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:54,314
- Hi.
- Hi.

750
00:45:54,353 --> 00:45:55,662
Shall we?

751
00:45:55,697 --> 00:46:00,748
AGENT: If the neighbors ask,
you paid about $200,000 for it.

752
00:46:00,785 --> 00:46:03,469
CARMEN: It looks more
like 150 to me.

753
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:37,032
# The best I can #

754
00:46:37,072 --> 00:46:40,967
# But it's not good #

755
00:46:41,008 --> 00:46:43,594
# Enough for you #

756
00:46:45,393 --> 00:46:50,379
# You know I was
the kind who'd run #

757
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:53,199
# Anytime you'd call #

758
00:46:53,232 --> 00:46:57,160
# I guess I was the only one #

759
00:46:57,201 --> 00:47:00,332
# Who didn't mind at all #

760
00:47:00,368 --> 00:47:02,824
# I'll be your dreamer #

761
00:47:03,952 --> 00:47:07,913
# I'll be your fool #

762
00:47:07,953 --> 00:47:11,815
# Oh, my darling #

763
00:47:11,857 --> 00:47:15,818
# My whole life through #

764
00:47:15,857 --> 00:47:19,632
# Doing the best #

765
00:47:19,664 --> 00:47:22,763
# The best I can #

766
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:25,261
# But it's not good #

767
00:47:25,297 --> 00:47:27,817
Sure ain't much privacy
around here.

768
00:47:27,856 --> 00:47:29,002
# Enough for you... #

769
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:34,126
You want privacy,
you close the door.

770
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,102
But I don't think
that's what you want.

771
00:47:37,648 --> 00:47:40,332
Well, I guess you're gonna do
whatever it is you want.

772
00:47:44,368 --> 00:47:46,790
There's no way on earth
I can stop you.

773
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:09,320
There'll be a slight delay
in the divorce proceedings

774
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:11,368
while the couple hides out
from the killers.

775
00:48:13,969 --> 00:48:15,049
Good night.

776
00:48:15,088 --> 00:48:16,943
# Every time you kiss me #

777
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:21,417
# I'm still not certain
that you love me #

778
00:48:21,456 --> 00:48:24,424
DONNA: This is Elvis Presley
Boulevard on a rainy day.

779
00:48:24,465 --> 00:48:27,312
This is the <i>Lisa Marie.</i>

780
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:28,359
It's a jetliner he bought.

781
00:48:28,401 --> 00:48:30,343
He named it
after his daughter.

782
00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:32,141
Her and I have
the same birthday.

783
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:34,762
And I'll tell ya
somethin' else.

784
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,655
My life number is 9.

785
00:48:36,689 --> 00:48:37,933
BLACKBIRD:
What's a life number?

786
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:42,192
Okay, well, you add up
your date of birth, right?

787
00:48:42,224 --> 00:48:44,810
Um, like February's
the second month, so that's 2.

788
00:48:44,848 --> 00:48:48,776
I was born on the first.
That's 1, so 2 and 1 is 3.

789
00:48:48,817 --> 00:48:50,475
Then you add in the year
that you were born.

790
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:52,814
I'm not gonna tell you
when that was,

791
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:54,703
but my number
comes out to 9.

792
00:48:54,737 --> 00:48:56,362
BLACKBIRD:
Even if you were born in 1900,

793
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:58,856
that'd still add up to 10.

794
00:48:58,896 --> 00:49:01,067
Yeah, see, 10 counts as 1.

795
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:04,204
Donna, get dressed,
go buy some fuckin' beers.

796
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,997
Think he cares
about your queer photos?

797
00:49:06,032 --> 00:49:07,821
- You're just jealous.
- Jealous of what?

798
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:09,744
You know what the difference
between me and Elvis is?

799
00:49:09,777 --> 00:49:11,303
Yeah. You're ignorant.

800
00:49:11,345 --> 00:49:13,483
No. I'm alive,
and he's dead.

801
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:15,430
Well, I got news for you.

802
00:49:15,472 --> 00:49:17,261
After you die,
you think anybody's

803
00:49:17,296 --> 00:49:18,922
gonna go and visit your grave?

804
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,059
Not even your mama,
if you had one.

805
00:49:22,096 --> 00:49:23,623
But a hundred years from now,

806
00:49:23,664 --> 00:49:25,803
people will still be going
to Graceland.

807
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,775
Donna,
you're so goddamn stupid.

808
00:49:28,816 --> 00:49:31,566
Let me ask you
a question, Donna.

809
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,226
Would you rather
have Elvis sing to you

810
00:49:33,264 --> 00:49:34,246
or fuck you?

811
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:36,907
I know what you think
I'm gonna say,

812
00:49:36,944 --> 00:49:38,188
and you'll probably
call me a liar,

813
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,396
but I'd rather
have him sing to me.

814
00:49:40,432 --> 00:49:42,767
Damn. You know what?
I believe her, though.

815
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,262
'cause Elvis
wasn't no con.

816
00:49:44,305 --> 00:49:46,694
He wouldn't have been dirty
or smelly enough for Donna.

817
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:49,420
Hey, leave her alone.

818
00:49:49,457 --> 00:49:50,918
Who, Donna?

819
00:49:50,961 --> 00:49:54,343
Why don't you
shut the fuck up for a while?

820
00:49:56,881 --> 00:49:59,019
If you ever talk to me
like that again...

821
00:49:59,057 --> 00:50:00,551
Yeah?

822
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:02,021
What?

823
00:50:03,216 --> 00:50:05,605
This is
Elvis' billiard room.

824
00:50:05,648 --> 00:50:07,852
There's 750 yards of material...

825
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:10,027
Can I have a word... Armand?

826
00:50:13,617 --> 00:50:16,617
What the fuck
is your problem?!

827
00:50:16,656 --> 00:50:17,605
You are.

828
00:50:18,609 --> 00:50:22,438
And from now on, you don't
leave my fucking sight.

829
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,335
Well, how about
when I go to the bathroom?

830
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:25,296
You wanna watch?

831
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:26,474
Or when I'm givin'
Donna a jump

832
00:50:26,512 --> 00:50:27,974
and you're out there,
wishin' it was you.

833
00:50:28,017 --> 00:50:30,864
Or do we keep pretendin' that
you're not tryin' to fuck her?

834
00:50:34,577 --> 00:50:37,708
Hey, you listen to me.

835
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,187
Keep your big
fucking mouth shut,

836
00:50:42,224 --> 00:50:44,166
and don't worry about it.

837
00:50:45,968 --> 00:50:47,343
MAN: So you're a welder, huh?

838
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:49,645
WAYNE: You bet I am.
AWS certified.

839
00:50:49,681 --> 00:50:51,568
Can you weld plates
watertight?

840
00:50:51,601 --> 00:50:55,310
Well, I can weld a goddamn
building so it won't fall down.

841
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:57,930
MAN: I got a job you might
want to take a look at.

842
00:51:03,569 --> 00:51:04,648
BLACKBIRD: Hey.

843
00:51:04,689 --> 00:51:08,005
Maybe today she can't
tell us where they are.

844
00:51:08,048 --> 00:51:11,015
But tomorrow, she might.

845
00:51:27,825 --> 00:51:30,923
What job were
you and Wayne working on?

846
00:51:32,752 --> 00:51:34,825
Well, we've been
on different ones.

847
00:51:34,865 --> 00:51:36,556
Anyway, what I started
to tell you,

848
00:51:36,592 --> 00:51:39,112
I don't see what difference
it makes who mails the check,

849
00:51:39,153 --> 00:51:42,666
you or us, but the boss says
we have to do it.

850
00:51:42,704 --> 00:51:44,614
Now, I told him you were
a nice lady to offer...

851
00:51:44,657 --> 00:51:46,828
And I told you,
I don't have their address.

852
00:51:46,864 --> 00:51:47,944
She never gave it to me.

853
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:49,839
The only thing I have
is their phone number.

854
00:51:49,872 --> 00:51:51,595
You want that?

855
00:51:51,633 --> 00:51:54,764
Oh. Well, you didn't
mention that, did you?

856
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,044
You have their number?

857
00:51:56,081 --> 00:51:58,382
Not on the phone, I didn't.

858
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:03,053
I wasn't absolutely positive
whom I was speaking to.

859
00:52:03,088 --> 00:52:04,681
That's how they find out
if you're home

860
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:07,754
so they can come in
and rape you.

861
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,698
I understand.

862
00:52:10,737 --> 00:52:11,981
Can't be too careful.

863
00:52:12,016 --> 00:52:14,471
You give him a check... hmm!

864
00:52:14,513 --> 00:52:17,415
And you know
where he'll cash it, don't ya?

865
00:52:17,457 --> 00:52:19,180
The nearest bar.

866
00:52:19,217 --> 00:52:20,297
Oh!

867
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,573
What's wrong?

868
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:25,292
I should never bend
that far from the waist!

869
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:28,263
It's like somebody
stuck a knife in me.

870
00:52:28,305 --> 00:52:29,646
Oh!

871
00:52:29,681 --> 00:52:32,463
That's your sacroiliac.

872
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:35,344
Why don't you lay down
on the couch?

873
00:52:40,368 --> 00:52:44,809
No, no, let's get you
down here on the carpet.

874
00:52:44,848 --> 00:52:46,190
I'm gonna give you
a backrub.

875
00:52:46,224 --> 00:52:48,461
I had a foster mom
one time named Jackie.

876
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:49,543
She was some kind of therapist.

877
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:51,308
She worked with cripples.

878
00:52:51,344 --> 00:52:52,654
She showed me how.

879
00:52:52,688 --> 00:52:56,071
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

880
00:52:56,112 --> 00:52:57,127
Yes, ma'am.

881
00:52:57,169 --> 00:52:58,696
Oh!

882
00:53:00,816 --> 00:53:03,304
You're not gonna hurt me,
are you?

883
00:53:06,832 --> 00:53:10,061
Oh! Ohh!

884
00:53:14,384 --> 00:53:16,392
What the fuck
did you do?

885
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:25,061
Oh, God! Fuck!
I just gave her a backrub.

886
00:53:25,105 --> 00:53:26,446
Jesus!

887
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,058
It's a Missouri code.

888
00:53:30,096 --> 00:53:32,136
I did a bank there once.

889
00:53:32,177 --> 00:53:34,031
[Ringing]

890
00:53:41,488 --> 00:53:42,797
WAYNE, RECORDING:
Hi, it's Matt and Pam.

891
00:53:42,832 --> 00:53:44,425
We're not here.
We'll call you back.

892
00:53:46,192 --> 00:53:47,272
Hello.

893
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:49,770
Hello?

894
00:53:53,553 --> 00:53:54,862
Hello.

895
00:54:19,056 --> 00:54:21,391
[Phone ringing]

896
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:33,766
RECORDING:
Hi, it's Matt and Pam.

897
00:54:33,808 --> 00:54:36,045
We're not here.
We'll call you back.

898
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,277
WAYNE: Hey, it's me. I tried
calling you a couple times.

899
00:54:39,312 --> 00:54:40,294
Wayne.

900
00:54:42,065 --> 00:54:44,650
No, I'm fine.

901
00:54:44,689 --> 00:54:45,899
What?

902
00:54:45,936 --> 00:54:48,009
I'm losing you. What?

903
00:54:49,137 --> 00:54:50,381
BLACKBIRD:
We gotta make a plan.

904
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:51,910
RICHIE:
That's my fucking phone!

905
00:54:51,952 --> 00:54:54,341
You want to wait
till they trace the number?

906
00:54:54,385 --> 00:54:56,359
That thing had all
my fuckin' numbers in it.

907
00:54:58,288 --> 00:55:00,230
Why don't we go to Missouri?

908
00:55:00,272 --> 00:55:01,701
- We will.
- Yeah? When?

909
00:55:01,744 --> 00:55:03,632
When they stop looking
for us,

910
00:55:03,664 --> 00:55:06,698
or when they think
we stopped looking for them.

911
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:10,478
So, Gerald,
this is the master bedroom.

912
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,063
I love how you guys
say "master bedroom."

913
00:55:17,104 --> 00:55:20,071
Yes, we guys
like our guy words.

914
00:55:21,648 --> 00:55:23,982
You're not from here.

915
00:55:24,016 --> 00:55:25,260
That's right.

916
00:55:25,296 --> 00:55:26,954
Where are you from?

917
00:55:31,216 --> 00:55:32,645
Detroit way.

918
00:55:32,689 --> 00:55:34,445
I know Detroit.

919
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,579
We, uh, didn't look
at the kitchen.

920
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,673
Are you following me?

921
00:55:53,712 --> 00:55:54,857
Excuse me?

922
00:55:54,896 --> 00:55:55,823
Are you following me?

923
00:55:55,856 --> 00:55:58,573
Mrs. Benkowski, hello.

924
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:00,463
How'd the viewing work out?

925
00:56:00,496 --> 00:56:02,056
Well, you should know.

926
00:56:02,097 --> 00:56:03,209
You were outside
this morning.

927
00:56:03,248 --> 00:56:04,841
Hey, did you make
a sale with Gerald?

928
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,018
I know he's been
looking at a lot of places.

929
00:56:07,056 --> 00:56:08,517
Do they know we're here?

930
00:56:08,561 --> 00:56:09,771
Are they coming after us?

931
00:56:09,808 --> 00:56:11,085
Listen, you come by
the office anytime.

932
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,233
It's always good to see you.

933
00:56:18,928 --> 00:56:20,357
CARMEN: What if we're bait?

934
00:56:21,616 --> 00:56:22,826
What are you talkin' about?

935
00:56:22,865 --> 00:56:24,425
What if we're
being used as bait?

936
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,090
What if the FBI's just waiting

937
00:56:26,128 --> 00:56:27,557
for those two freaks
to find us

938
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,608
so they can find them?

939
00:56:29,648 --> 00:56:31,470
What if they
show up here, Wayne?

940
00:56:31,505 --> 00:56:33,708
They'll get caught.

941
00:56:33,744 --> 00:56:35,599
Oh. Before they kill us.

942
00:56:35,632 --> 00:56:36,680
Sure.

943
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,542
Yeah, I vote for before.

944
00:56:39,537 --> 00:56:41,871
I can't even begin
to pretend to do my job here.

945
00:56:41,904 --> 00:56:43,333
I show a house,
I'm just waiting

946
00:56:43,377 --> 00:56:45,100
for somebody
to pull a gun on me.

947
00:56:45,136 --> 00:56:47,209
What's the choice?
I mean, I don't understand.

948
00:56:47,248 --> 00:56:48,742
I could sit here
and go crazy.

949
00:56:48,785 --> 00:56:50,727
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

950
00:56:50,768 --> 00:56:51,716
Listen...

951
00:56:53,392 --> 00:56:54,919
can we try something different?

952
00:56:55,888 --> 00:56:57,644
Come down after work one night.

953
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,844
Meet some of the guys
and their wives.

954
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,506
You know, they're good people.

955
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,300
There's little places
along the river.

956
00:57:04,336 --> 00:57:06,409
We could get something to eat.

957
00:57:07,664 --> 00:57:10,566
Does nothing bother you?

958
00:57:10,608 --> 00:57:12,135
Sure, yeah.
This bothers me.

959
00:57:12,177 --> 00:57:13,486
You and me.

960
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,518
Not gangsters.

961
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:05,548
I need you to do
something for me.

962
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,909
Is that what you dragged me
out here to tell me?

963
00:58:11,312 --> 00:58:13,287
You got some balls on you,
chief, I'll give you that.

964
00:58:13,328 --> 00:58:15,783
I don't give a fuck
what you need.

965
00:58:15,824 --> 00:58:17,679
Yes, you do.

966
00:58:17,712 --> 00:58:19,883
That's why you come
when I called.

967
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:23,404
You don't want
the cops picking me up.

968
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,407
If for some reason
they start asking me,

969
00:58:26,448 --> 00:58:29,580
was I in Detroit
when the old man was killed.

970
00:58:29,616 --> 00:58:31,885
And how the fuck
they gonna connect me

971
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,097
to a half-breed
piece of shit

972
00:58:33,136 --> 00:58:34,827
they dragged up
from the bottom of this lake?

973
00:58:36,464 --> 00:58:39,246
The blue Cadillac
you gave me,

974
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,582
the one with the papers
in the glove compartment,

975
00:58:41,616 --> 00:58:45,358
registered
to your pepperoni company.

976
00:58:45,392 --> 00:58:47,596
Anything happen to me,

977
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:50,479
a friend gonna drive the car
to some precinct.

978
00:58:50,512 --> 00:58:52,650
They gonna find
the piece I used

979
00:58:52,688 --> 00:58:56,485
to whack the old man for you
wrapped in a letter...

980
00:58:56,528 --> 00:58:59,211
from me about you.

981
00:58:59,248 --> 00:59:01,614
Not a love letter.

982
00:59:03,152 --> 00:59:06,250
This is what
you're gonna do for me.

983
00:59:06,288 --> 00:59:09,190
There's a cemetery
in Port Huron.

984
00:59:09,232 --> 00:59:12,266
My kid brother
is buried there.

985
00:59:12,304 --> 00:59:15,882
He never had the kind
of funeral he deserved.

986
00:59:18,736 --> 00:59:21,224
WAYNE: You can be walkin' around
on that skinny little beam,

987
00:59:21,264 --> 00:59:23,533
and you've got clouds
around your head.

988
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,295
I mean, some days, you think
you see things so clear.

989
00:59:28,336 --> 00:59:31,500
The place you live,
the store you shop in,

990
00:59:31,536 --> 00:59:33,030
the church
you got married in.

991
00:59:33,072 --> 00:59:34,446
I could see everything.

992
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,236
Everywhere I'd ever been
my whole life

993
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,930
from the top of a building.

994
00:59:37,968 --> 00:59:40,750
MAN: So why the hell
did you quit and come here?

995
00:59:40,784 --> 00:59:42,889
Job quit me, man.

996
00:59:42,928 --> 00:59:44,935
Get to an age,
they start pullin' you down,

997
00:59:44,976 --> 00:59:46,983
about one floor a year.

998
00:59:47,024 --> 00:59:48,682
End up too near the ground.

999
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,956
I got my pride.

1000
00:59:50,992 --> 00:59:52,453
Too much maybe.

1001
00:59:52,496 --> 00:59:54,536
WAITRESS:
I've been watchin' you, honey,

1002
00:59:54,576 --> 00:59:56,299
and you should talk less
and drink more.

1003
00:59:58,544 --> 01:00:00,137
I think these poor folks

1004
01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:03,111
deserve another round there,
uh... Linda.

1005
01:00:03,152 --> 01:00:05,257
MAN: Oh, ho ho, yeah.

1006
01:00:05,296 --> 01:00:07,238
Hey, Pam, honey,
how did you, uh...

1007
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,095
fall for a shy guy like Matt?

1008
01:00:11,504 --> 01:00:13,576
- His muscles.
- Ahh!

1009
01:00:13,616 --> 01:00:14,696
And the short shorts.

1010
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:15,913
Ooh!

1011
01:00:15,952 --> 01:00:17,545
CARMEN: Nah, he was
a show-off, even back then.

1012
01:00:17,584 --> 01:00:19,820
I had to show off
to get her attention.

1013
01:00:19,856 --> 01:00:22,125
Every guy in town's
chasin' after her.

1014
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:24,810
Not only is she gorgeous,
she's smart as a whip.

1015
01:00:24,848 --> 01:00:26,157
Don't exaggerate, Matthew.

1016
01:00:26,192 --> 01:00:28,199
Her mother's always sayin',
"Carmen, honey"...

1017
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,301
because that's
what her mother called her

1018
01:00:32,336 --> 01:00:33,612
'cause she's a great singer.

1019
01:00:33,648 --> 01:00:36,201
She'd say, "Carmen, honey,

1020
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,345
"you're a talented,
beautiful girl.

1021
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:41,417
"Don't go wastin' your life
on an ironworker.

1022
01:00:41,456 --> 01:00:43,180
"You're gonna wake up
in 20 years,

1023
01:00:43,216 --> 01:00:46,064
and you're gonna realize,
he never deserved you."

1024
01:00:47,568 --> 01:00:49,161
15 years.

1025
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,233
He is such a liar.

1026
01:00:52,271 --> 01:00:53,580
My mother adores him.

1027
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,721
We got karaoke here
on Friday.

1028
01:00:55,759 --> 01:00:57,003
You gotta come.

1029
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:57,967
- Yeah!
- Oh, no.

1030
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,105
You wait.
She's a knockout.

1031
01:01:00,144 --> 01:01:02,348
Ah ha ha. I'm gonna
knock you out, Matt.

1032
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:10,860
"I have been
watching you, honey.

1033
01:01:10,896 --> 01:01:12,968
You should talk less
and drink more."

1034
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,512
Why is it that
I feel I know you best

1035
01:01:17,552 --> 01:01:20,007
when I hear you talking
with other people?

1036
01:01:20,048 --> 01:01:21,357
WAYNE: I felt good tonight.

1037
01:01:21,392 --> 01:01:22,799
I like this town.

1038
01:01:24,272 --> 01:01:26,028
Telling all your stories.

1039
01:01:26,064 --> 01:01:27,526
Hey, nothin'
I said tonight back there

1040
01:01:27,568 --> 01:01:28,877
wasn't the God's truth.

1041
01:01:28,912 --> 01:01:30,537
Hmm.

1042
01:01:31,887 --> 01:01:32,902
No.

1043
01:01:33,872 --> 01:01:35,366
Don't turn on the light.

1044
01:01:43,536 --> 01:01:44,780
You married?

1045
01:01:47,216 --> 01:01:49,583
No, sir, I'm on a break.

1046
01:01:50,704 --> 01:01:52,231
Live around here?

1047
01:01:53,808 --> 01:01:56,077
I can't tell you
where I live.

1048
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,672
That's a government secret.

1049
01:02:55,952 --> 01:02:57,294
SCALLEN: We found them
last week.

1050
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,789
Two bodies, probably shot,
driven to a remote location,

1051
01:03:02,831 --> 01:03:04,358
and burned in the car.

1052
01:03:04,399 --> 01:03:06,025
Nothing much left
to be identified.

1053
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,727
The Indian has
a surviving brother.

1054
01:03:10,767 --> 01:03:13,134
He's doing life in Kingston
Correctional Facility.

1055
01:03:14,511 --> 01:03:17,610
We ran DNA tests,
and we checked them against his.

1056
01:03:19,792 --> 01:03:21,166
Match was positive.

1057
01:03:25,232 --> 01:03:27,119
What happens to us now?

1058
01:03:27,152 --> 01:03:28,712
Well,
after we close the case,

1059
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:31,402
you can go back
to your life.

1060
01:03:31,439 --> 01:03:33,000
What if we
don't want to go back?

1061
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,982
SCALLEN: That happens.

1062
01:03:37,295 --> 01:03:40,165
But what you're saying is,
if we wanted to, we could?

1063
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:41,964
That also happens.

1064
01:03:52,047 --> 01:03:53,640
It's still busy.

1065
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,989
Try her again.

1066
01:03:57,007 --> 01:03:59,179
I'm not your fuckin'
kid brother.

1067
01:03:59,216 --> 01:04:00,361
You can't order me around.

1068
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,018
I know that, Richie.
I buried my kid brother.

1069
01:04:03,056 --> 01:04:05,129
So lighten up. We're dead.

1070
01:04:05,168 --> 01:04:08,430
If they dig around some more,
we're alive.

1071
01:04:08,464 --> 01:04:10,886
We just bought us
some more time, that's all.

1072
01:04:10,928 --> 01:04:12,422
Now try the old lady again.

1073
01:04:15,152 --> 01:04:17,453
WAYNE: She's, uh, packing,
Lenore. Let me go find her.

1074
01:04:21,072 --> 01:04:23,821
She says she'll call you
when she gets back to the house.

1075
01:04:23,856 --> 01:04:25,449
LENORE: You're not
coming together?

1076
01:04:25,488 --> 01:04:26,503
No. As a matter of fact,

1077
01:04:26,544 --> 01:04:28,846
I'm stayin' down here
for a while.

1078
01:04:28,879 --> 01:04:30,373
LENORE: What do you mean,
for a while?

1079
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:33,318
Kind of a trial separation.

1080
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,531
LENORE: I don't understand.

1081
01:04:35,568 --> 01:04:37,226
I'm not sure we do, either.

1082
01:04:37,264 --> 01:04:40,046
But that's where we're at.

1083
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,967
LENORE: Have you been
fighting again?

1084
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,625
No, no fighting.

1085
01:04:43,664 --> 01:04:44,744
LENORE:
You will not break up.

1086
01:04:44,784 --> 01:04:46,693
Lord knows
I prayed for it.

1087
01:04:46,736 --> 01:04:48,492
WAYNE: Okay, Mom,
appreciate it.

1088
01:04:51,664 --> 01:04:55,625
Well, she says
no way we'll break up.

1089
01:04:55,663 --> 01:04:58,598

It'll never happen."

1093
01:05:11,471 --> 01:05:13,381
I'll wait for the movie.

1094
01:05:14,671 --> 01:05:16,297
Can we at least
give it a try...

1095
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:19,502
now that we're safe?

1096
01:05:19,536 --> 01:05:21,226
Maybe Matt and Pam
can fix the things

1097
01:05:21,264 --> 01:05:22,638
Wayne and Carmen
never could.

1098
01:05:24,176 --> 01:05:25,582
Do you honestly believe that?

1099
01:05:25,616 --> 01:05:27,307
I honestly do.

1100
01:05:30,704 --> 01:05:31,652

No.

It's not one day.

what I cared for you,

1113
01:05:58,575 --> 01:06:00,299
and what you cared for me.

1114
01:06:00,335 --> 01:06:01,448
Okay, let's fix that.

1115
01:06:03,408 --> 01:06:05,034
I think we can fix that.

1116
01:06:06,736 --> 01:06:08,841

Your mom told us
you'd be home by breakfast.

01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:42,214
four double cheeseburgers,
eight boxes of fries.

1234
01:16:42,255 --> 01:16:45,452
For dinner, three ham steaks,
six sweet potatoes,

1235
01:16:45,487 --> 01:16:49,099
six or seven regular potatoes,
some stuffing.

1236
01:16:49,135 --> 01:16:52,518
Carmen, can you imagine
this guy takin' a dump?

1237
01:16:57,326 --> 01:17:01,866
See, Donna,
that's the Bird's sweetheart.

1238
01:17:01,903 --> 01:17:05,286
When this is all done,
the Bird and Donna...

1239
01:17:05,327 --> 01:17:07,149
they're gonna
go down to Memphis,

1240
01:17:07,183 --> 01:17:11,143
hold hands,
look at all that Elvis shit.

1241
01:17:11,183 --> 01:17:12,906
Isn't that right, Bird?

1242
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,817
Only trouble is,

1243
01:17:15,855 --> 01:17:18,026
Donna is probably fuckin' Elvis
as we speak.

1244
01:17:37,103 --> 01:17:41,161
You get one, Richie,
just like everybody else.

1245
01:18:04,495 --> 01:18:05,956
You know why I shot him?

1246
01:18:09,807 --> 01:18:11,530
He wasn't who I thought he was.

1247
01:18:14,478 --> 01:18:16,867
I had this kid brother.

1248
01:18:16,911 --> 01:18:20,009
We were in a hospital
one time on a job.

1249
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:22,661
And when we were done,

1250
01:18:22,703 --> 01:18:24,361
there was this nurse
standing there.

1251
01:18:26,575 --> 01:18:28,430
She saw us do it.

1252
01:18:32,335 --> 01:18:35,269
My kid brother just stood there,
looking at her.

1253
01:18:41,903 --> 01:18:43,725
He looked at her too long.

1254
01:18:47,183 --> 01:18:49,070
Maybe he liked her face.

1255
01:18:57,103 --> 01:18:58,826
Anyway,
that's what killed him.

1256
01:19:04,623 --> 01:19:06,030
Go put some clothes on.

1257
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:14,057
I have to go upstairs.

1258
01:19:19,503 --> 01:19:21,129
I'm not like Richie.

1259
01:19:22,607 --> 01:19:24,101
I'm not the same as him.

1260
01:19:27,759 --> 01:19:28,741
I know.

1261
01:20:54,383 --> 01:20:55,495
Aah!

1262
01:20:56,782 --> 01:20:59,171
You meet a woman.

1263
01:20:59,215 --> 01:21:02,346
You kid yourself
she sees you.

1264
01:21:02,382 --> 01:21:04,771
Sees who you really are
under all the shit.

1265
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:08,838
Turns out, just another bitch
with the lip service.

1266
01:21:08,879 --> 01:21:10,373
You're wrong.
You're wrong.

1267
01:21:10,414 --> 01:21:12,105
- I do see you.
- Shut up.

1268
01:21:12,142 --> 01:21:14,052
I panic. I panicked
when I saw the gun.

1269
01:21:14,095 --> 01:21:15,022
I... I panicked.

1270
01:21:15,055 --> 01:21:16,462
Shut up!

1271
01:21:16,495 --> 01:21:18,088
Where's your husband?

1272
01:21:18,127 --> 01:21:19,054
I don't know.

1273
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:20,134
When's he get back?

1274
01:21:20,174 --> 01:21:21,352
I don't know.

1275
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:23,430
Well, then you call him.

1276
01:21:23,471 --> 01:21:25,958
You call him, and
you tell him to get back here.

1277
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:28,457
I'm tired of waiting.

1278
01:21:28,495 --> 01:21:30,317
I want to finish this.

1279
01:21:30,351 --> 01:21:32,009
No, please.

1280
01:21:34,574 --> 01:21:36,429
He's not coming back.

1281
01:21:36,463 --> 01:21:38,983
He's in Missouri.

1282
01:21:39,022 --> 01:21:41,357
He's not even
my husband anymore.

1283
01:21:43,247 --> 01:21:45,352
Don't you get it?

1284
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:47,846
Don't you know anything
about real life?

1285
01:21:50,286 --> 01:21:52,109
Real life?

1286
01:21:52,143 --> 01:21:53,998
What the fuck is that?

1287
01:22:15,215 --> 01:22:16,589
Missouri, huh?

1288
01:22:24,494 --> 01:22:25,639
WAYNE: Carmen?

1289
01:22:27,343 --> 01:22:28,390
It's me!

1290
01:22:30,415 --> 01:22:32,040
Tried calling.

1291
01:22:33,423 --> 01:22:34,601
Honey?

1292
01:22:36,814 --> 01:22:37,927
You're gonna have to let me in.

1293
01:22:37,967 --> 01:22:40,007
I... I don't have a key.

1294
01:22:40,046 --> 01:22:41,475
CARMEN: Wayne, please go.

1295
01:22:41,518 --> 01:22:42,893
WAYNE: Okay, all right.

1296
01:22:42,926 --> 01:22:44,999
Just hear me out.

1297
01:22:47,151 --> 01:22:51,558
Look, I've had 400 miles,
15 years

1298
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:53,126
to think about this, so...

1299
01:22:54,927 --> 01:22:56,715
say five's terrible, right?

1300
01:22:56,751 --> 01:22:58,889
That's what you said.

1301
01:22:58,927 --> 01:23:01,512
So let's go for six.

1302
01:23:02,542 --> 01:23:08,172
And then if we make it to six,
then we could try for seven.

1303
01:23:09,295 --> 01:23:14,630
'Cause... I really want
to make it to 10 for you.

1304
01:23:16,047 --> 01:23:19,724
Carmen, 'cause I get it now.

1305
01:23:19,758 --> 01:23:21,700
Carmen?

1306
01:23:29,262 --> 01:23:30,888
I understand.

1307
01:23:30,926 --> 01:23:35,149
So, uh, if you're
not gonna let me in,

1308
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:38,150
then at least
let me get somethin'...

1309
01:23:39,663 --> 01:23:41,834
in the car.

1310
01:23:41,871 --> 01:23:43,561
A present. I left it.

1311
01:23:49,134 --> 01:23:50,083
Ooh!

1312
01:24:17,103 --> 01:24:19,372
Aah! Aah! God!

1313
01:24:32,655 --> 01:24:34,411
Aah!

1314
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:37,550
Aah!

1315
01:24:37,582 --> 01:24:41,095
BLACKBIRD: You gotta know what
you're doing when you go in.

1316
01:24:42,830 --> 01:24:44,554
You gotta have it
figured out.

1317
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:49,412
Don't hang around.

1318
01:24:49,454 --> 01:24:50,883
Don't get interested.

1319
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:53,575
It's empty.

1320
01:24:55,951 --> 01:24:57,773
Then you
don't make mistakes.

1321
01:26:57,774 --> 01:26:58,774
