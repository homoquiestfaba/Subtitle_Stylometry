1
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:36,119
LEADING LADIES

2
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,553
No.

3
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,521
We did not just get second place!

4
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,790
We are not second best!
We are not second place!

5
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,824
Mom...

6
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,560
We worked so hard for this...

7
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,528
Hours, weeks!

8
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,031
Couple number 23!
Did you see her samba?

9
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,300
I'm so sorry about your second place.

10
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,801
I know. I really let Mom down again.

11
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,304
We are just horrible,
horrible daughters.

12
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,572
We failed Mom.

13
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,307
We failed her for the last time.

14
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,541
We'll never dance again!

15
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,310
You didn't do this
all by yourself, dear.

16
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,545
It takes two to Cha-Cha,
and I don't know what

17
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,514
that sweet honey Cedric thought
that he was doing out there,

18
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,516
but he left you high and cold!

19
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,819
Oh, you think this is funny?

20
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,021
This is serious - deadly serious.

21
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,023
Some people go through their
whole lives without having

22
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,292
the kind of talent that you
have in your little pinky toe,

23
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,295
and I'll be boxed up and bowed
if some unworthy slip of a man

24
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,297
thinks he's going to take
our dreams away from us.

25
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,299
- Our dreams?
- Mom, that's enough.

26
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,534
Oh, no, no, no!

27
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,837
I can never get enough of
your sweet, sweet loving, Sheri.

28
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,505
You were just getting going.

29
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:03,308
Enough about me, let's talk about me.

30
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,510
I don't have any more
words to say to you tonight.

31
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,347
I'll see you tomorrow at 7 am, pronto.

32
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,815
Breakfast in bed?

33
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,283
I like my eggs over easy.

34
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,517
Like he likes his men.

35
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,787
Shh! Girls, your mother is
still pretending I'm not gay.

36
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,022
Oh, Cedric...

37
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,524
When you finally decide to settle down,

38
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,561
no self-respecting young woman
is going to want to marry a man

39
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,829
who says that he's gay.

40
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,531
That's a good one, Sheri.
May I borrow that?

41
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,267
It'll cost you.

42
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,035
I secretly love your mother.

43
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,808
- 7 am!
- Have fun.

44
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,811
- I'm serious, Cedric!
- So am I.

45
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,780
Hey, Rickie! We're number two!

46
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,515
Tasi!

47
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,030
OK, maybe we were wrong
about Kelly green.

48
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,531
Maybe it's fuchsia.

49
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,800
Fuchsia with more stones, size twelves.

50
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,037
But if we do it that way,
we're gonna take in the bodice,

51
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,271
and add more sequins...

52
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,273
and that beautiful gauzy material!

53
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,541
You were right, baby girl.

54
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,310
Kelly green was not the way to go.

55
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,311
It washes you out.

56
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,780
Now fuchsia - nobody overlooks
a girl in fuchsia!

57
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,819
Definitely fuchsia!

58
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,287
But we'll need to make sure

59
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,556
the sequins match the fabric exactly.

60
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,258
That fish is gonna pop, Sheri.

61
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,560
Mom, do you really think Bubbles
should be eating fried chicken?

62
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,561
No.

63
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,530
Why would you ask a question like that?

64
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,799
Bubbles can eat whatever he wants.

65
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,534
Can't you, Bubbles?

66
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,536
Here, Toni.

67
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,771
You need your energy for tomorrow.

68
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,807
What about me, Sheri?

69
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:45,777
Oh, you never have a
shortage of energy, Moon Pie.

70
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,780
Well, we have seven months,
two weeks and four days

71
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,549
before the South-Eastern
Midwest Regional

72
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,584
Amateur Ballroom Competition.

73
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,786
Tougher competition
means tougher rehearsals...

74
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,256
waterproof mascara
and all-day lip gloss!

75
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,525
We Camparis have met defeat before

76
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,527
and she is wearing a cheap, knock-off,

77
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,563
polyester periwinkle gown

78
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,798
from the Famous Barr basement sale.

79
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:10,535
Next time, we'll meet her
stone-faced and steadfast

80
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,504
with our shiny, glass stiletto heels

81
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,539
with size 5 Swarovskis.

82
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,308
Bed!

83
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,278
Don't forget to brush your teeth!

84
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,289
- Toni?
- Yeah.

85
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,790
I need you to cut in here.

86
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,058
Yeah, OK. Why?

87
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,527
Something is not working right

88
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,529
and I need to see if it's her
or if it's her.

89
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,797
- You're such an ass.
- Thank you.

90
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,533
Who put you in charge?!

91
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,035
Who put me in charge?
Who put you in charge?

92
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,510
OK...

93
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,512
Start right after the first dip.

94
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,018
Watch your forearm.

95
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,288
Now give her some good resistance...

96
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,023
I'm never going to be
doing this, Ced, come on.

97
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,824
But you're doing it right now.

98
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:23,528
It's in that transition, Tasi.
Your weight's on the wrong foot.

99
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,030
You mean where you stepped on my foot?

100
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,032
That's because your foot
wasn't supposed to be there.

101
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,034
- Where? Under your heel?
- Children!

102
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,036
Children, my head is splitting.

103
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,804
We have got to quit for the day!

104
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,539
I have to get that pot roast in the oven

105
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,807
if we plan to eat later.

106
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:36,775
We've hardly eaten breakfast

107
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,543
and she's already thinking
about pot roast.

108
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,012
- It's called lunch, you idiot!
- It's called obsessive.

109
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,548
Enough! We're off.

110
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,016
- Fine.
- Fine.

111
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,523
Toni, do you need a ride to work?

112
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:56,795
Umm... Sure.

113
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,530
Fine. Come on let's go.

114
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,531
See you at home later?

115
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,832
Fine.

116
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,034
I mean, yeah, I'll see you later.

117
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,036
Maybe I'll stop by the restaurant.

118
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,813
Whoa!

119
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,281
Is this the first time someone
got your pants off in the car?

120
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,282
You know you don't count.

121
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,552
Just because I like boys,
that means I'm not one?

122
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,021
I don't mean it like that.
You're family.

123
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,023
Am I?

124
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,558
Last time I checked,
there weren't any men

125
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:27,792
in the Campari family.

126
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,027
Touché.

127
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,296
Those two are lucky they have you.

128
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,798
Well, someone's got to wear the pants.

129
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,067
What's Sheri gonna do

130
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,036
when you move out
and stop supporting her?

131
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,804
Hmm... Move out.

132
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,773
There's an interesting notion.

133
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,008
Why that would just change everything!

134
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,776
Why haven't I thought of that before?

135
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,811
Are you here all night?

136
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,279
Yeah, I'm working a double.

137
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,547
Yuck.

138
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,816
Geez!

139
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,786
You gotta put some aloe on those arms.

140
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,022
Or some evening gloves.

141
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,523
Thanks for the ride, Ced.

142
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,818
That's the problem!

143
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,286
I don't have to. This is your thing.

144
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,022
No, this is your responsibility.
You're the one that...

145
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,023
No. No.

146
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,024
I'm not gonna take
responsibility for this.

147
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,326
This is your fault.

148
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,296
Owww! Shit!

149
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,031
Take that one to table seven.

150
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,533
Yeah, I'm on it, Tony.

151
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,802
And can I get that minestrone
before the guy eats his arm off?

152
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,036
Aw, you're killin' me, Toni.

153
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,271
You're killing me!

154
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,039
Who's the boss, huh?

155
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,010
Toni, Tony, Tone!

156
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,312
I feel like I'm stuck
in an early 90's time warp.

157
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,014
Hey, Ced, your booth just opened up.

158
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,282
Oh, perfect.

159
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,817
No rush, sweetie.

160
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,318
We'll be over here
starving half to death.

161
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,521
Oh, uh, Tasi's over at table two...

162
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,023
under the window,
carefully ignoring you.

163
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,293
With what's-his-face?

164
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,262
Yeah, that what's-his-face.

165
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,018
Hey, you got a handle
on this mess, boss?

166
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,553
You know the wife at this hour.

167
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,787
It's all good, boss. I got it.

168
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:45,023
You're a good kid. If I had a son...

169
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,558
Get outta here.

170
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,059
OK, OK...

171
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,001
I'm helping!

172
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,736
Yeah.

173
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,739
You never helped before.

174
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,508
There's a first time for everything.

175
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,978
Speaking of which...

176
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,480
How 'bout you and I go find ourselves

177
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,983
a real pardner, pardner?

178
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,252
Don't do John Wayne.
It doesn't suit you.

179
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,987
But I like cowboys.

180
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,989
Where's your crew?

181
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,491
Outside in the car waiting for you.

182
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,993
Is it a clown car?

183
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,762
Toni, you're going. Tonight we dance.

184
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,763
Fine.

185
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,232
If you want to go, just go.

186
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,499
- Fine.
- Fine.

187
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,237
Do we invite them?

188
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,474
I take it we're not going.

189
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,247
Tasi? Ride?

190
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,748
No, I have the car.

191
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,018
Every exit is an entrance.

192
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,254
Goodbye, favorite sisters.

193
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:49,988
Bye, Rickie.

194
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,259
Women's room still out of order?

195
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,227
Yeah, let me key you into the staff one.

196
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,996
I don't want you to catch anything.

197
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,998
Yeah. Boys are gross.

198
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,768
Yeah.

199
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,252
How long do you think
we could sit out here

200
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,254
before she'd actually
come out and get us?

201
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,223
Do you think she knows we're here?

202
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,292
Sheri knows all.

203
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:29,994
I don't know...

204
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,996
Isn't there a little
bit of comfort in that?

205
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,503
I kind of love her from this distance.

206
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,241
It's nice to watch her
when she's not watching me.

207
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,242
I wouldn't know.

208
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,481
She's like a sweater
that's two sizes too small...

209
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:54,285
It keeps you warm,
but it itches like hell.

210
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,487
I don't think anyone's
ever referred to her

211
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,256
as 'too small' before.

212
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,497
There's lasagna in there.

213
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,765
You ready then?

214
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,000
Ready.

215
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,012
My girls!

216
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,247
- Who's hungry? Toni?
- I'm starving.

217
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,250
Did that dress seem a little
snug at your last fitting?

218
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,519
Is that going to work
for the demo tomorrow?

219
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,989
Or are you just bloated
from your... period.

220
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,224
Well, apparently everything's
going to fit just fine

221
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,493
since you keep taking my food away.

222
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,995
Where is everything going?

223
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,997
I'm just loving you, Moon Pie.

224
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,000
I have smoked turkey. Gobble, gobble!

225
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,570
Did you really smoke it
or just smoke around it?

226
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:49,240
It used to be the three
of us against the world,

227
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,243
and now it's just you two
against your mother.

228
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,746
All I do is love you.

229
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,247
We know.

230
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,251
Apparently that's not all you do.

231
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,986
Shh.

232
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,022
Honestly, who raised you two?

233
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,258
He's leaving in the morning.

234
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,227
Goodnight, my darlings. Kiss, kiss.

235
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,987
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

236
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,256
You shouldn't let her
get to you like this.

237
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,024
This has nothing to do with her.

238
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:40,992
Doesn't matter.

239
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,794
You shouldn't let her get to you.

240
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,229
You can eat whatever you want.

241
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,503
And this - it's gotta stop.

242
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,005
What can I do?

243
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,474
You know she's full of crap.

244
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,976
I told you this has
nothing to do with her.

245
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,978
It has nothing to do with you either.

246
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,480
It has nothing to do with anybody

247
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,816
in this pathetic, psychotic family, OK?

248
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,484
- Whoa...
- No! Just leave me alone!

249
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,252
Hey! What is going on here?

250
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,021
Why are you freaking out at me?

251
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,490
Was that not you with me
just now laughing at Mom?

252
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,492
I am always on your side.

253
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,494
We need to be with each other on this.

254
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,495
She's crazy.

255
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,797
I told you it's not about her.

256
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,000
I need you to not be crazy with me.

257
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,003
I don't care what you need.
It's not about you.

258
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,272
Do you even know what I need?

259
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,242
I need you to not be
in my face right now.

260
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,986
No, no. This just can't be.

261
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,489
It has to fit.
This just has to fit, Sugar!

262
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,226
Zippety-doo-dah that's tight!

263
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,996
It's not happening, Sheri.

264
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,732
This just can't be.

265
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,267
I added the extra fabric,

266
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,002
and the sequins are on
that stretchy thread

267
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,004
so this shouldn't bunch.

268
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:06,010
Maybe if we just shift
some things around in there.

269
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,012
Mother! Get off of me!

270
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:11,782
It's not working!
None of this is working!

271
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,018
Just get this damn thing off of me!

272
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,522
OK, OK. We're fine, we're fine.

273
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,223
I'm fine, we're fine.

274
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,526
You don't have to wear it for the demo.

275
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,227
But let's just fix your hair at least.

276
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,763
Toni, be a dear and pick
this up for your sister.

277
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:29,033
OK, Moon Pie,
let's see what we can do here.

278
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,235
A couple more pins...

279
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,039
There we go...

280
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,507
Breathe...

281
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,976
Breathe and... Sparkle!

282
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,745
You are insane!

283
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,481
Just get away from me!

284
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,482
I'm not doing this!

285
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,484
This demo is not that important.

286
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,756
So, I'm supposed to just march in there

287
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,992
and interrupt Gene's class
and tell all those good people

288
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,761
that we're not going to do it...

289
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,763
that you're just not going to dance?

290
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,499
I don't care.
I don't care about any of this.

291
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,235
I just don't care!

292
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:10,741
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care...

293
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:14,779
Tasi, stop it! Just calm down!

294
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,013
We're gonna get out of here.

295
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,248
We're gonna go home,

296
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,250
but you need to snap out of this.

297
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,751
Get off of me!

298
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,987
And don't tell me what to do!

299
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,756
Don't tell you what to do?

300
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,525
I'm the one always
taking orders around here.

301
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,759
That's all I do.

302
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,495
I take orders from you.
I take orders from Sheri.

303
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,264
I take orders at work
from pimply little brats

304
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,498
who haven't even hit puberty yet.

305
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,500
All I do is take orders.

306
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,769
Oh, you're such a martyr.

307
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,771
This is all about you now?

308
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:44,242
You have no idea what I'm going through.

309
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,776
This is about me!

310
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,511
This is about me, damn it!

311
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:53,484
ME, ME, ME, ME, ME,
ME, ME, ME, MEEEE!!!!!

312
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,785
Wow.

313
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,255
I can't even compete with that.
You sound just like Mom.

314
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,492
Ouch.

315
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,494
Get me out of here... Now!

316
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,999
Oh, drama, drama, kickball change!

317
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,767
Marjorie, love the polka dots.

318
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,503
Gene, the glasses are
always smashing on you...

319
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:17,241
Ladies, gentlemen... Sheri...

320
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,478
It's been a lovely evening,
but I must bid you adieu.

321
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,749
There's no place like home.

322
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,251
- Home?
- Oh, come on, girl.

323
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,519
You've been doing this your whole life.

324
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,254
Yeah, with my sister.

325
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,022
Eww...

326
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,227
Don't worry.
We're all sisters down here.

327
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,229
It's time we got you a real partner.

328
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,001
What took you so long?

329
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,769
I brought a friend.

330
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,773
She's not really your type.

331
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,775
She's my stunt double!

332
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,244
Oh, she's the one you've
been telling me about...

333
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,479
The one with the mom.

334
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,780
He knows.

335
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,782
Your mom's a nut job,
your sister's impossible,

336
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,784
and you're the only one worth saving.

337
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,253
We've all been waiting for
you to come out dancing.

338
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,522
We? Who's we?

339
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,790
And I didn't say I was going to dance.

340
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,525
Ah, but you will.

341
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,993
Says who?

342
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,762
I know you well enough.

343
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,765
You're too strong a lead to
let these amateurs show you up!

344
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:48,766
Me?

345
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,234
Come on.

346
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,004
What?

347
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,507
I've just never seen you like this.

348
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,775
With a guy?

349
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,243
No, following.

350
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,780
If you wanna be a good lead...

351
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,749
you have to learn how to follow!

352
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,752
Wait! Where are you going?

353
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,488
Don't worry! You'll be fine.

354
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,257
Just remember:
walk, walk...

355
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,792
triple... triple.

356
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,261
I know that! Wait!

357
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,530
Where are you going...

358
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,500
...going ...gone.

359
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:47,998
Oh, my gosh!

360
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,002
I'm sorry.

361
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,738
No. I'm sorry.

362
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,508
I guess I really don't know
what I'm doing.

363
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,742
Oh, no, you're fine!

364
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:01,745
You know, with a better lead
it doesn't have to be that way.

365
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:02,780
Really?

366
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,512
Uh, I don't know how...

367
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,515
It's OK. Just follow me.

368
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,243
Ladies, this is...

369
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,246
Oh, Toni.

370
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:04,982
Mona.

371
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,486
You guys looked great out there.
You make a cute couple.

372
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,988
Awww, thanks.

373
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,255
It was all her.

374
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,791
I was totally lost with
Diesel Debbie over there...

375
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,760
But this beauty,

376
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,495
made me feel like
I knew what I was doing.

377
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,230
Are you some kind of pro or something?

378
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,232
Oh, no. I'm not professional.

379
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,501
But my sister competes
in the local ballroom circuit.

380
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,503
She hasn't gone pro yet
but she might be able to

381
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,271
if she wins the next
couple competitions.

382
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,272
We're not really sure.

383
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,475
It's all politics really,
but I don't compete.

384
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,478
I just help out when
her partner's not available.

385
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,981
I came here with him.

386
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:43,987
Anyway, Mona picks up really easily.

387
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,023
Mona usually gets picked up easily.

388
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,997
Umm... Is there a bathroom?

389
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,232
Oh, yeah.

390
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,767
Down the hall, around the corner...

391
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,502
Go downstairs; it's cleaner.

392
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,237
No, go upstairs...

393
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,505
- She hot?
- What?

394
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,974
No. I...

395
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,276
Yeah.

396
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,011
Unbuttoned.

397
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,025
What are you doing?

398
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,779
Hey, Hottie,
I was just coming to find you.

399
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,746
Yeah?

400
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,049
You're Cedric's girl, right?

401
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,017
You know, as much as
that's even possible.

402
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,018
Right.

403
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,488
Well, he just cut outta
here with a really hot guy.

404
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,257
They were doing the
quickstep toward the door, so...

405
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,259
I don't think he's coming back.

406
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,494
Shit.

407
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,496
What? Was he your ride?

408
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,231
I'm gonna kill him.

409
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,234
He was your ride.

410
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:38,268
Well...

411
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,003
I guess you're just stuck here with me!

412
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,975
Hey, you OK?

413
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,479
Hey, are... Are you crying?

414
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,248
No, I'm fine!

415
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,251
Are you drunk?

416
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,253
No! I'm just crazy.

417
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,789
You're kinda cute when you're crazy.

418
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,492
You should see my mother.

419
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,761
Actually, no, she is not cute.
She's kind of scary.

420
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,263
My sister is cute... and crazy...

421
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,265
more on the cuter side of crazy...

422
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,500
Will you come here?
I'm gonna take you home.

423
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,223
I'm glad you're here.

424
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,494
Sooo... I've got wine.

425
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,995
I've got beer.

426
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,497
I've got Kool-Aid.

427
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:41,765
I'm addicted to that stuff

428
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,800
even though they say it rots your teeth.

429
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,236
We can even make it grown up.
I've got vodka!

430
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:47,771
What flavor?

431
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,005
Vodka?

432
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:50,240
Kool-Aid.

433
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,775
Oh, purple.

434
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,277
I've got milk, too...

435
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:55,779
we could do milk and cookies.

436
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,014
Kool-Aid, Grown up.

437
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,983
Purple teeth sounds great.

438
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:07,224
Why don't you hit play on
the CD that's in the stereo.

439
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,493
The stereo's under the kimono
next to the green velvet couch.

440
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,263
Thanks for the map.

441
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,748
Wanna dance?

442
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,485
Let's see...

443
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:11,521
If I remember correctly from earlier...

444
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,490
your hand went here,

445
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,759
mine here...

446
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,496
And we danced like so.

447
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,775
I'm sorry.

448
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,510
I don't know how to do this.

449
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,748
Just follow me.

450
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:56,739
Where is that...

451
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,712
I'm not here.

452
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,949
But you are here.

453
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,752
Where is here anyway?

454
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,722
I've certainly never been here before.

455
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,724
Neither have I.

456
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,225
Oh, come on.

457
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,461
No, seriously.

458
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:20,196
I've been with lots of women...

459
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,965
Lots?

460
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,733
Enough.

461
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:31,708
What I'm trying to say
is I've been there...

462
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,476
But I've never been here.

463
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,719
Why does she keep calling me?

464
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,988
She who?

465
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:47,991
Oh, my sister.

466
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,492
Oh, good.

467
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,227
Then I don't have to get jealous.

468
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:52,729
Oh, trust me,

469
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,231
you have nothing to be jealous about.

470
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,767
You say you've never been here before?

471
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,736
I've never been anywhere.

472
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:02,205
What?

473
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,974
Do they keep you
tied up in the basement?

474
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,977
I'm not kidding, Mona.

475
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,213
I'm 22 years old,

476
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,448
and I've never even kissed a boy before.

477
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,754
Well, now you don't have to.

478
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,963
What does Toni stand for?

479
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,965
Antoinette.

480
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,968
Ooooooo... Antoinette.

481
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:34,971
I like it.

482
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,739
It lasts longer.

483
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,744
What are these?

484
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,947
Rope burn scars - from the basement.

485
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:46,749
Shut up.

486
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,484
Seriously, Toni.

487
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,989
I work in Hell.
It's really hot down there.

488
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,993
You're the cute pizza girl!

489
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:57,493
I am?

490
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:00,730
Oh, my God, yes! You are.

491
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,965
And you come in
with Cedric all the time.

492
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,767
Anchovies on the side.

493
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,769
Oh, well, those are for Marlene.

494
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,971
Oh... No wonder she likes me.

495
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,973
We both like you!

496
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,975
And she's picky.

497
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,944
We've already established
that you're not.

498
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,446
Oh, shut up!

499
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,950
No, don't answer it.

500
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,218
Weird. It's Cedric.

501
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,955
Hey! Where the hell did you go?

502
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,724
Tell him he's a whore!

503
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,226
What?

504
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,961
Uh, OK, OK.

505
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,730
Is she OK?

506
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,765
No, you stay there. I'll take a cab.

507
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:36,966
Hey, I can drive.

508
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,234
I... I'll explain later.

509
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,736
No, no, no. You stay there!

510
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,737
I'll be right there!

511
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,738
I'm coming down.

512
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,941
Where is she? Is she OK?

513
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:46,743
Where were you? Are you OK?

514
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,944
What do you mean? You left me.

515
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,979
I left you when I couldn't find you.

516
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,980
Oh, thanks a lot.

517
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:53,716
For taking care of your sister?
You're welcome.

518
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:56,218
Not like anyone else was here for her.

519
00:45:56,219 --> 00:45:57,954
She certainly wasn't
going to call Sheri.

520
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,222
Why didn't she call me?

521
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,757
She's been calling you all night.

522
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,225
Check your messages.

523
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,960
God, I can't believe this is happening.

524
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,762
What's happening, Toni?

525
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,963
Where have you been hiding out?

526
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:09,966
Antoinette?

527
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,201
Can we not focus on me right now!

528
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,203
Well, that's easy.
We never focus on you.

529
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:15,972
Seriously, how is she?
What even happened?

530
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,707
Well, you know our Tasi.

531
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,208
She's a wee bit Sheri.

532
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:20,977
So, when I dragged you

533
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:23,746
out of that circus
you call a family last night,

534
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:25,982
Tasi decided she was just
going to go walk home.

535
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,216
- What?!
- Yeah.

536
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,484
Although...

537
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,220
martyrdom's not as good of
a look on her as it is on you.

538
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,756
Of course, the poor girl was exhausted.

539
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,224
It was a stupid thing to do.

540
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:36,959
She barely made it halfway home.

541
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:39,996
Her blood sugar's on, like,
the brink of anemia or hysteria.

542
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,197
God, I don't know.

543
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,232
I don't understand all this stuff.

544
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,735
But she's OK.

545
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:49,738
I'm sure she'd love to see you.
Just... try to be nice.

546
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:51,707
She needs to start
taking better care of herself

547
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,710
now that she's... pregnant.

548
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,221
You're pregnant?!

549
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:06,722
You're having a baby?!

550
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:07,957
Babies...

551
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,226
We're having twins. Surprise!

552
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:11,727
Who's we?

553
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:12,728
We, we.

554
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:14,230
You and me we. The usual we.

555
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,731
What other we do we know?

556
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:18,000
I'm going to kill you.

557
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,236
You can't do that.
I'm having your babies.

558
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,204
This is sick.

559
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:24,240
Tasi, what is going on here?

560
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,741
Are you still mad at me?

561
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:26,742
Still mad?

562
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,744
This, this is new mad.

563
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:30,213
This is a whole other
feeling I've got right now.

564
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,281
And I think that you have more
important things to worry about

565
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,749
than whether or not I'm mad at you.

566
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,718
No, I don't.

567
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,955
I need you to not be mad at me.
I need you.

568
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:40,223
Then why didn't you tell me?

569
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:41,757
We tell each other everything.

570
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:43,226
Why weren't you just honest with me?

571
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,761
I wasn't even honest with myself.

572
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,964
And maybe I'm mad at you.

573
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,199
You didn't pick up
your phone last night.

574
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,734
You weren't here for me.

575
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,203
You hit me. I was pissed.

576
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:55,738
Where were you?

577
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,206
I went out with Cedric.

578
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,208
I came here with Cedric.

579
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,984
Looks like we both have some secrets.

580
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,458
Does Mom know?

581
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:16,959
Does Mom know anything?

582
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,966
How could I not know?

583
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,468
Oh, my God...

584
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,470
You've been puking... and Sheri...

585
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,472
and the dress, and your moodiness.

586
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,974
Oh, come on. I'm always moody.

587
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:33,976
And Sheri and I always fight.

588
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,946
And people get fat...

589
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,714
And I've thrown up before.

590
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:42,718
Oh, honey...

591
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,954
I am so sorry that
I couldn't be there for you

592
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,990
from the beginning...
and help you be healthy.

593
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:50,459
I didn't know if I wanted a baby...

594
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,194
these babies.

595
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:55,464
And then, tonight...

596
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:58,467
when I heard those heartbeats...

597
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:01,470
I could see them in my mind...

598
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:04,006
in my body.

599
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,474
The two of them.

600
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:08,210
The sounds that they made together...

601
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,980
Those steady rhythms.

602
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,950
I could picture them dancing in there.

603
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,985
It was just like you and me.

604
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:21,457
I have to keep these babies safe.

605
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,960
And I don't think I can do it by myself.

606
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,236
So I guess we can rule
out Cedric as the father?

607
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:39,475
Yeah, but he'll probably be
the best dad they'll ever have.

608
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:43,212
And bio-dad? Out of the picture?

609
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:45,448
I'm a Campari girl.

610
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,950
The guy's always out
of the picture, right?

611
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:49,452
You don't even know.

612
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:51,220
- What?
- Nothing.

613
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:53,956
So, where do we put Sheri in all this?

614
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,958
Ugggh...

615
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:58,227
I need a little more time on that.

616
00:49:58,228 --> 00:49:59,228
Granted.

617
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,963
"Grandmama."

618
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,466
It could be the role of her life.

619
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:04,967
Ugh...

620
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:06,969
I'm not ready for that.

621
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,972
You're having babies!

622
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,441
Boys or girls? Or a boy and a girl?

623
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,977
I don't know!
I don't think I wanna know.

624
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:20,216
This is their only chance to
be loved without all of the...

625
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:25,221
you know, the pinks and blues,
the trucks or Barbies.

626
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:29,225
I just want them to be loved,
no matter who they are.

627
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,960
Oh, I love that.

628
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,497
- You're having babies!
- Mmm-hmm.

629
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,968
So... What do we do now?

630
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:43,205
We dance.

631
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,237
* A sleight of hand

632
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:21,477
* With fingers full of grace

633
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:30,453
* Work the magic that you do *

634
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:39,228
* Disappear without a single trace *

635
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:45,734
* And every time I fall for you *

636
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:57,980
* I fall for you

637
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:01,717
* And when I do I can't seem *

638
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:05,954
* To pick myself up off the ground *

639
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:17,466
* Last night I had a dream

640
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,735
* I was your assistant it seems *

641
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,972
* I was dressed in ostrich feathers *

642
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,975
* You did that trick where
you sawed me in half *

643
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,978
* But you laughed and then you left *

644
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:34,750
* Without putting me back together *

645
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,454
Who've you got there?

646
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:14,757
What? Oh... Hey, Ced.

647
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:17,459
I've never seen you like that before.

648
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,728
Like what? Dancing?

649
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,964
I dance alone all the time.

650
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,766
I don't think you were alone this time.

651
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:26,001
I don't know what you're talking about.

652
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:28,971
Well...

653
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,973
You've been acting kind of weird lately.

654
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,474
Weird how?

655
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:35,211
I don't know...

656
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,479
Weird different...

657
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,215
Weird funny.

658
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,750
Is that illegal?

659
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,218
It is in some states.

660
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,221
What are you implying?

661
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,755
I'm beginning to think that

662
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:49,225
Tasi's not the only
Campari girl with a secret.

663
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,760
Oh, me with a secret life.

664
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,195
Wouldn't that be something?

665
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:55,464
At least I'd have a life then.

666
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:59,235
That attitude was sooo three months ago.

667
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,471
You've got a whole
new thing going on for you.

668
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:05,741
Happy and sarcasm... they clash.

669
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,477
And it's just not a good look on you.

670
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,212
Happy, however...

671
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:11,981
We are not having this discussion.

672
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,218
Yes, we are!

673
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:19,221
What's going on?
And what's with the glow?

674
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,756
New moisturizer?

675
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,191
Lancôme?

676
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,493
Mona?

677
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:27,730
Mona?!

678
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,732
What's Mona have to do with this?

679
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,201
What?

680
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:33,736
She and I are friends.

681
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,740
We're just friends. It's nothing!

682
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,475
Really? Nothing?

683
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:41,477
Shit.

684
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:45,481
Oooh, it seems I've let
the cats out of the bag.

685
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,750
Do you mind, Cedric?

686
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,952
No, Cedric, you stay. I'm leaving.

687
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,754
No need. I'm already gone.

688
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,223
She's totally worth it.

689
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,737
What are you afraid of right now?

690
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:13,208
I'm afraid I'll turn around
and you won't be standing there.

691
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,478
Are you more afraid that I'll leave,

692
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,213
or that I'll stay
and someone might actually

693
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:20,215
see me standing here?

694
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,217
I'm sorry.

695
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,218
I told you I don't know what I'm doing.

696
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:26,221
Well, right now you're hurting me!

697
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,494
I can see if you wouldn't want
to tell your mom or your sister

698
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,730
or someone who might actually
be bothered by this...

699
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,465
But Cedric?

700
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,467
He practically introduced us.

701
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:41,203
If I tell someone about this,
then it makes it real.

702
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,473
And that's a bad thing?

703
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:46,742
You know I don't mean it like that.

704
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:50,746
It's just... my real life...

705
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,981
everything is just so messed up.

706
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:57,219
And you're so different...
and so perfect.

707
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:00,456
My family is like a disease of chaos.

708
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,991
And I don't want you in that,
or us in that.

709
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,227
You can't catch crazy, Toni.

710
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,764
I can handle your family.

711
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:11,200
And maybe I want to be in that.

712
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,736
You could've given me a choice.

713
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,704
Maybe I can't handle it.

714
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,742
I don't feel like I have a choice,

715
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:23,479
and I don't like myself
when I'm in that world.

716
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,449
And I didn't want you to
not like me there either.

717
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,451
I like me with you.

718
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,755
I like you everywhere.

719
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:37,459
I'm actually starting to think I'm...

720
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:42,464
Toni, I'm 26 years old.

721
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:45,968
I've played the role
of the secret girlfriend.

722
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,737
I've been the lab partner to
someone else's experiment.

723
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,472
I've been the phase before "Mr. Right."

724
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:51,740
Is that where we are?

725
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,975
Because if that's where we are,

726
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:54,476
I'm sorry but I care too much about you

727
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,211
to play that game this time!

728
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,981
I'm not hiding you; I'm hiding them.

729
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,984
This... Us...

730
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:04,486
feels bizarrely natural to me.

731
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:06,722
I mean, I've been partnered
with women my whole life.

732
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:08,724
I don't think your sister really counts.

733
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:11,460
You know what I mean.

734
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:14,196
Yeah, I know what you mean, Toni...

735
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:17,466
but I still feel invisible.

736
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,968
I don't like feeling like I don't exist.

737
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,471
I want us to be a part of a real life.

738
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:24,740
I am so sorry, Mona.

739
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:30,212
This... Us...

740
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:31,980
This is real.

741
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,451
I've been taught my whole life
to just sit in the background

742
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,753
and make somebody else look good -

743
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:40,956
because a good lead is never noticed.

744
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:45,494
And then as soon as I find a
good partner worth showing off

745
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:47,463
I make her dis...

746
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,731
I make you disappear with me.

747
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,005
Well, when you put it like that
it almost sounds romantic.

748
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:03,745
I don't mind disappearing
with you every once in a while,

749
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:07,483
but it's got to be a choice...

750
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,218
Our choice.

751
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:13,489
Are you sure you know what
you're getting yourself into?

752
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:14,756
No.

753
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:16,992
But I trust you.

754
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:19,728
I should trust you, right?

755
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,233
Dance with me?

756
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:26,969
Here?

757
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,471
Anywhere.

758
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,714
We are not fat!

759
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,749
I did not make fat babies!

760
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,952
I ain't never gonna be no
16 inches again, Miss Sheri.

761
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,954
Just close your mouth like I've
been telling you to for months

762
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:47,456
and suck it in!

763
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,958
- I'm gettin' the girdle!
- Shut up!

764
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:51,727
Will you just shut up?!

765
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,462
Don't you say shut up to your mother.

766
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:54,463
I made you,

767
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,465
and I will make you fit into this gown!

768
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:59,468
You are insane! Are you blind too?!

769
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,236
Will you look at me, for God's sake?!

770
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:02,704
I am not fat!

771
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,772
I know.

772
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:06,475
We are not fat. We're not fat.

773
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:07,442
Mother!

774
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:10,946
We're not fat! We're PREGNANT, dammit!

775
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:12,481
I'm pregnant!

776
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,483
Does Cedric know what he's done?!

777
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,953
Have you told him? You need to call him.

778
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,755
You need to call him right now!

779
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,723
Mom, Cedric is gay!

780
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,959
Gay! Gay! Gay!

781
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,961
So he says. And I trusted him!

782
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:28,730
I left my baby alone with him...
with a gay man!

783
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,966
What kind of father is he going
to be if he can't even decide

784
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:32,734
where to dock his dingy?!

785
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,203
Oh, my God, Sheri. You are absurd!

786
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:37,973
Cedric is not
responsible for everything!

787
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:39,975
You cannot blame him for this!

788
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,777
Then who can I blame?

789
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,979
Toni, how long have you known?

790
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,949
How could you girls pull the
chiffon over my eyes like this?

791
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,451
You have made me look like
an idiot in my own home.

792
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:50,986
You?

793
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:52,220
Toni, car!

794
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:56,992
Don't you put this back on me.
I have always loved you!

795
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,961
Where are you going? Come back here.

796
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:01,196
You girls are keeping
secrets from your mother.

797
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:02,998
No secrets from your mother!

798
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,201
So...

799
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,470
What's Sheri done this time?

800
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:10,472
Did she sateen the living room... again?

801
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:11,740
She knows.

802
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:13,742
Knows which?

803
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,978
About the babies, of course.

804
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:18,213
And Sheri is happy to be
a grandmother, I presume?

805
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:19,715
Oh, can I call her "Granny?"

806
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:21,483
You'd better call her soon,

807
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,452
because she wonders what
you're going to do about it.

808
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,486
Moi?

809
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:25,954
Apparently, no one has explained

810
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,756
the mysteries of conception to Sheri.

811
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:30,492
She must still think you can
get pregnant from dancing.

812
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:32,728
Honestly, I think she
wants them to be yours.

813
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,731
While that is delightfully flattering,

814
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:37,466
we did clear this up, didn't we?

815
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,967
You know our mother.

816
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,202
Perception is reality,

817
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,704
so I'm afraid you my baby daddy.

818
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,973
How are we going to tell
them about Daddy's roommate?

819
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,942
OK, this is no longer funny.

820
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:47,976
Seriously, how did she take it?

821
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:51,013
She took it and ran with it
as she always does.

822
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,714
Actually, we ran.

823
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:55,751
I think she's more concerned
with the competition

824
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:59,454
and who's going to fit into that
sparkly monstrosity of a dress

825
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:02,724
than she is with motherhood
and the rest of my life.

826
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:06,728
I'm so glad she can stop adding
panels and deal with reality.

827
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,199
You expect Sheri to deal with reality?

828
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,468
Well, it's not my problem anymore.

829
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:15,971
Her feelings? The competition?

830
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:16,972
Sequins.

831
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,740
I'm no longer the favorite to win;

832
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,009
It's all you now, Toni. I'm out.

833
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:22,744
I've got enough on my plate.

834
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:24,980
Are you gonna eat that?

835
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:26,748
All me? What are you talking about?

836
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:27,983
I don't dance.

837
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:28,950
Sure you do.

838
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:30,218
I don't compete.

839
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,753
Now you will.

840
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:32,954
Who says?

841
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:35,223
Come on, Toni, this is your chance.

842
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:36,958
You'll be great.

843
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:39,961
And it'll distract Sheri
and keep her off of my belly.

844
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:41,963
No.

845
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:43,732
It'll be fun...

846
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:46,234
I'll help!

847
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:49,237
And you will look fetching in fuchsia.

848
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:51,773
Don't make the pregnant lady beg.

849
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:54,776
I will get down on my knees,
and I will not get back up.

850
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,978
Yeah, it'll be fun.

851
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,780
Will you let me lead?

852
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,717
No...

853
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,452
I won't let you lead.

854
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,987
I'm hurt.

855
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:08,990
Come on, Toni.

856
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,727
No, I'll do it.

857
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,963
But if I'm going to be
a part of this madness,

858
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:16,231
I have two requests.

859
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,233
Number one, you both have to help.

860
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,735
Of course. Anything.

861
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,470
Where else am I going to be?

862
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,972
And number two...

863
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,974
I get to pick my own partner.

864
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,709
No offense, Ced.

865
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:30,445
None taken.

866
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,218
Well, then...

867
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,953
To our mystery dancer.

868
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:49,464
I never thought I'd grow up
to be a ballroom dancer.

869
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:50,999
I never thought
I'd grow up to be a lesbian.

870
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:53,235
You ready?

871
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,503
No.

872
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:05,213
Tasi, Mona. Mona, Tasi.

873
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:06,948
I believe we all know Cedric?

874
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,483
Who doesn't?

875
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:10,752
Welcome to our world.

876
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:12,220
Won't this be cozy.

877
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,757
So just follow everything Tasi does.

878
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:16,725
She is the best.

879
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:18,727
Uh, thanks, Toni.

880
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:21,763
So, if you're me...

881
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:24,466
that makes Toni Cedric.

882
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:27,969
Oh, wow...

883
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,972
Sheri is gonna have
a field day with this one.

884
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:34,776
My life just got so much simpler.

885
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,746
Mona, I hope you like sequins.

886
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:38,947
Do I have a choice?

887
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:41,716
Oh, here, we have no choices.

888
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:42,984
Ladies...

889
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,219
Shall we?

890
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:01,203
* Family can't be trusted

891
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:05,240
* The weather changes too

892
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:08,476
* You need something permanent *

893
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:12,214
* To set your dreams with glue *

894
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:15,217
* I can't promise heaven

895
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:19,221
* That's something only God can do *

896
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:22,224
* But if you want to talk to him *

897
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:25,460
* I'll make sure your
call gets through *

898
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:33,468
* 'Cause you belong to me... *

899
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:37,239
* Now, your mother used to hold you *

900
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:40,442
* Every time you cried

901
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:44,446
* And your neighbors used
to check up on you *

902
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:47,716
* When you tried to hide

903
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:51,253
* Now, your mother cannot hear you *

904
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:55,223
* And the neighbors moved away *

905
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,727
* So listen very closely

906
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:01,463
* To every word I say

907
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:09,738
* 'Cause you belong to me... *

908
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,007
* God said I can have you *

909
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:16,977
* You belong to me...

910
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:52,213
* Call me when you're lonely *

911
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:55,984
* Call me when you're down *

912
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:58,720
* My door is always open *

913
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:02,958
* And there's always more around *

914
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:06,461
* If you come for answers

915
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:09,965
* You'll have to wait in line *

916
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:13,735
* But if you come for earthly things *

917
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:16,471
* I'll show you a good time *

918
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:24,479
* 'Cause you belong to me... *

919
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,715
* God said I could have you *

920
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:31,219
* You belong to me

921
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:39,461
* You belong...

922
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,463
* God said I could have you *

923
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:47,202
* You belong to me...

924
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,977
And cue the tantrum.

925
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:57,212
No!

926
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,481
No, no, no!

927
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:01,950
This is not what I think!

928
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,985
What do you think, Sheri?

929
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:06,454
I...

930
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:08,223
I don't know what to think.

931
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:10,959
I don't even know what to make of you.

932
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,494
Both of you.

933
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:16,197
I have loved you more than anyone,

934
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,466
and this is how you repay me?

935
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:25,473
Did I raise one daughter
to be a whore...

936
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,443
and the other to be...

937
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:31,212
I don't even know what to call you.

938
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,247
A lesbian?

939
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:33,982
Oh, Tasi, don't be crass!

940
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,217
This is not some terrible thing.

941
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,486
Oh... OK.

942
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,955
This is not terrible. I'm fine.

943
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:42,957
I can be fine with this.

944
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:46,461
Just tell me you're happy...

945
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:48,463
and in love...

946
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,965
and in love with a woman,

947
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:52,967
and I'll be just dandy fine.

948
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:56,471
Mom...

949
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,473
I'm happy.

950
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:02,210
I'm finally happy.

951
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:04,479
And I'm in love with a woman.

952
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:12,220
I need a cigarette.

953
01:08:21,214 --> 01:08:23,231
That could've been worse.

954
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,466
It will be.

955
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,201
Ladies, rides?

956
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,970
You go on ahead, I'll catch up with you.

957
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,972
I think we're gonna stay.

958
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:32,740
No, Tas, it's OK.

959
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:34,709
I think I should take
this one on my own.

960
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,211
Really?

961
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:37,478
You sure?

962
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:38,746
Yeah.

963
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,953
I'll call you later.

964
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,488
Ooh, phone tree!

965
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:55,463
Thank you for doing this.

966
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,733
It really means a lot to me.

967
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:02,971
It's because of you
that I can do this...

968
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,205
but this is for me.

969
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,741
I get it.

970
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:08,209
I know you do.

971
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,711
I'll walk you out.

972
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:03,725
No...

973
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:06,160
This isn't happening.

974
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:15,436
This isn't happening to me.

975
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:18,206
You're right, Mom.

976
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,712
This isn't happening to you.

977
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:27,682
This is happening to me.

978
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,452
It's a good thing.

979
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,691
I can't do this.

980
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:37,725
Sure you can.

981
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,498
You taught me.

982
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,466
It's just,

983
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:48,436
slow, slow, quick, quick...

984
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:50,204
Oh, Antoinette.

985
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:51,706
What?

986
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,442
It's a beautiful name.

987
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:55,443
I know.

988
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:58,413
I just don't remember
the last time you used it.

989
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,717
I don't know what
to say about any of this.

990
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:05,186
You don't have to say
anything right now, Mom.

991
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:06,721
Just... shut up and dance.

992
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:08,690
Don't say shut up to your mother.

993
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,425
I'm hurt.

994
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:12,427
I'm angry.

995
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:13,928
And I'm mad at your father.

996
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:15,430
What?

997
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,932
Well, maybe if he hadn't left

998
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:19,734
you girls would have had
a better male role model

999
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,436
in your life, and...

1000
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:23,438
and we wouldn't have
turned out like this.

1001
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,206
Like what?

1002
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:26,441
Happy?

1003
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:29,444
Mom, look at me.

1004
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:31,446
See me.

1005
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:34,182
I'm happy.

1006
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:37,218
For the first time, I'm actually happy.

1007
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,921
My girls were always happy.

1008
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:45,226
No...

1009
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:47,729
See me alone.

1010
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:51,699
Alone?

1011
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:55,703
You were never alone.

1012
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:59,941
I was always there, always loving you.

1013
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,711
I loved you both enough for two.

1014
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:07,915
When he left,

1015
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:10,184
I did everything to make you happy.

1016
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:15,423
See me happy now.

1017
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:25,700
I don't think I can.

1018
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:12,713
Hey, boss, I'm taking off.

1019
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:15,917
Uh, you know, a woman
cannot live on pie alone.

1020
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:18,419
Well, it's Sheri's kitchen.
We just eat there.

1021
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,988
She only ever taught us how
to use foil and the fridge.

1022
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:23,724
No one cooks but her,
and there's dust on the burners.

1023
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:24,926
You know you're in trouble

1024
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:26,961
when an Italian mother won't feed you.

1025
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:30,465
Is she still just steamed
about Tasi and the babies?

1026
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,433
Two more Camparis to smother with love,

1027
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:34,936
I would've thought that woman
would be in heaven by now.

1028
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:37,938
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

1029
01:14:37,939 --> 01:14:40,942
Is she upset about you and your girl?

1030
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:42,443
Me and my what?

1031
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:43,444
Your "what..."

1032
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:44,946
You think I'm too old to understand

1033
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:47,448
these modem relationships you kids have?

1034
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:49,717
I've seen the Queer Eye.

1035
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:51,919
See! This laughing thing...

1036
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,421
You do this now.

1037
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:55,690
How am I going to judge
when you're this happy?

1038
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:56,958
Thanks, Tony.

1039
01:14:56,959 --> 01:15:00,928
So, you bring her around to
the counter and I'll meet her.

1040
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:02,697
Right, boss.

1041
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:04,932
Hey, you're gonna be alright.

1042
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:07,935
But, uh, be easy on Sheri.

1043
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:09,971
She is your momma.

1044
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:12,707
She loves you girls in her own way.

1045
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:16,444
You two are growing up,
making decisions on your own.

1046
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:19,714
That sound you hear is not disapproval.

1047
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,716
It's the sound of letting go.

1048
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:23,718
She's not even talking to us.

1049
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:27,688
Well, maybe that's what
her grief sounds like.

1050
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:31,192
Mother's love... it is powerful stuff.

1051
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,995
She'll get through it.

1052
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:35,730
You'll figure it out.

1053
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:38,933
You got big love, you get big hurt.

1054
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:40,935
You'll be alright.

1055
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:42,937
You are three strong women.

1056
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:45,438
Well, I've never really
thought of myself as strong.

1057
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,410
Oh, sweetheart, you hold that family up.

1058
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:52,914
Don't you think I
and everybody don't see that?

1059
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:54,916
You think that they don't feel that?

1060
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:57,952
Take care of yourself for once.

1061
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,688
Be... this happy.

1062
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,690
Sheri'll catch up.

1063
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:13,701
Now, you get outta here
before my pizza gets cold.

1064
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:14,936
Thanks, boss.

1065
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:21,208
If I have to see
another pizza in my life,

1066
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:24,178
I'm gonna blow chunks
all over Sheri's kitchen table.

1067
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:25,713
Down, girl.

1068
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:27,415
Think she'll ever come out?

1069
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,684
She hasn't even had a man
in there in over a month.

1070
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:32,420
She's not cooking. What's she eating?

1071
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:33,721
What's sustaining her?

1072
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:35,456
She's got her reserves.

1073
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:37,925
But how has she not
taken pity on us yet?

1074
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,694
You guys are such babies.

1075
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:41,162
You act like you've
never fed yourselves.

1076
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:42,430
O-M-G!

1077
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,699
It's like a gay club
before midnight in here!

1078
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,434
Really? Oh, my God!

1079
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:48,703
Have you seriously never
been to a grocery store?

1080
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:50,738
Of course we've been to a grocery store.

1081
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:53,174
Sheri just never lets us
put anything in the cart.

1082
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:54,909
Seriously! Have you seen this?

1083
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,945
It's like Barney's after a 20% off sale.

1084
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:59,447
I can't believe this.

1085
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,717
I am staring at two 20-year-old
grocery store virgins.

1086
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:04,185
She's 22!

1087
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:06,954
Honest to God, I can see the back.

1088
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:09,457
I always thought it went on forever.

1089
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,692
So we've been eating pizza for a month,

1090
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:12,927
because you two are too scared

1091
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:14,929
to go to a trickin' grocery store?

1092
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:17,698
We're not scared. It's just Sheri's job.

1093
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:20,935
Oh, no wonder she
treats you like children.

1094
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:21,936
Oh, come on, Mo.

1095
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:23,938
No. It is time, ladies!

1096
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:27,942
Today you make your maiden,
semi-solo voyage

1097
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:29,710
to the grocery store!

1098
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:30,911
And I will serve as your guide.

1099
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:31,946
Shut up, Mona.

1100
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:34,715
Oh, c'mon, it'll be fun.

1101
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:36,951
I never thought I'd say this,

1102
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:39,186
but I think I miss your mother.

1103
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:41,722
There will be people
at the grocery store.

1104
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:42,690
Yeah.

1105
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:45,192
I look like the fat lady
in the freak show.

1106
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:46,927
I look puffy.

1107
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:47,928
And people will look at me,

1108
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:51,165
and they'll try to talk to me,
and touch me.

1109
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,969
And rub my Buddha belly as if
one kick from my unborn children

1110
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:57,438
will grant their
anonymous, dirty fingers

1111
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:00,207
miraculous blessings
beyond their wildest dreams!

1112
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:01,942
Oh, honey, come on.

1113
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:04,412
It is for your babies
that we're doing this.

1114
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:05,946
They need some real food.

1115
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:07,715
And if I eat any more cheese,

1116
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,417
I'm going to have just
as much trouble as you

1117
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:12,186
trying to fit into that
sequined nightmare next month.

1118
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:13,921
You'll be beautiful, babe.

1119
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:14,922
Um... hello?

1120
01:18:15,174 --> 01:18:18,192
We're talking about me and
my irrational fears, thanks.

1121
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,160
Right.

1122
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:21,728
It's not so bad. And you're not puffy.

1123
01:18:21,729 --> 01:18:22,930
You're... glowing.

1124
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:23,931
Ugh.

1125
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:25,199
And we'll protect you.

1126
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,734
I mean really, how bad can it be?

1127
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:27,935
Just wait.

1128
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:43,951
* Everybody wants a piece of me... *

1129
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:48,422
* I see faces everywhere *

1130
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:53,194
* I try to act like I don't care *

1131
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:55,930
* All their eyes are on me *

1132
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:58,432
* They can see right through me *

1133
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,935
* I can't find a way *

1134
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:02,937
* I push and pull until I shout *

1135
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,172
* You want a piece of me *

1136
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:07,942
* You wanna lose control
and take a bite *

1137
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:10,711
* You want a piece of me *

1138
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:12,947
* I shake and shimmy
all through the night *

1139
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:15,182
* You want a piece of me *

1140
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:16,717
* I know what's on your mind *

1141
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:17,918
* I can read the signs *

1142
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:20,187
* You want a piece of me *

1143
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:21,756
* You're not the only one *

1144
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,190
* You better get in line *

1145
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:32,933
* Everybody wants a piece of me... *

1146
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:37,938
* Take my eyes, my lips, my hair *

1147
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:42,943
* Take it all and leave me bare *

1148
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,179
* There's nothing left
but still you want more *

1149
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,915
* You'd better be careful
what you wish for *

1150
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,917
* Pick me up off of the floor *

1151
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:52,686
* And let 'em watch us swing *

1152
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:54,922
* You want a piece of me *

1153
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:57,424
* You wanna lose control
and take a bite *

1154
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,927
* You want a piece of me *

1155
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:02,163
* Shake and shimmy
all through the night *

1156
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:04,932
* You want a piece of me *

1157
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,167
* I know what's on your mind *

1158
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:07,168
* I can read the signs *

1159
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:09,703
* You want a piece of me *

1160
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:10,938
* You're not the only one *

1161
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:12,706
* You better get in line *

1162
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:22,683
* Everybody wants a piece of me... *

1163
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:08,429
* Sneak attack and take me in *

1164
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,731
* I won't bite I'll let you win *

1165
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:11,699
* There's a you There's a me *

1166
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,933
* There's a she and a she *

1167
01:21:12,934 --> 01:21:15,436
* Everyone will see *

1168
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:17,938
* You want a piece of me *

1169
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:20,174
* You wanna lose control
and take a bite. *

1170
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:23,177
* You want a piece of me *

1171
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:25,179
* Shake and shimmy

01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,183
* I know what's on your mind *

01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:30,184

01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:32,686
* You want a piece of me *

* Everybody wants a piece of me... *

1178
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:56,944
Well, what do you know?

1179
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:00,447
The ugly duckling turned out to be...

1180
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:01,949
a penguin!

1181
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:02,950
Ced...

1182
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:04,218
Truly...

1183
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:05,686
Dashing...

1184
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:07,421
Handsome...

1185
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,423
And utterly gorgeous.

1186
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:11,458
I've never seen you look so perfect.

1187
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:12,927
Really?

1188
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,695
Do I still look like me?

1189
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,197
More than ever.

1190
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:19,700
Where's my girl?

1191
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:21,735
Oh, she's in the bathroom.

1192
01:22:21,736 --> 01:22:24,038
Tasi's 'Sheri-ing' her into her dress.

1193
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:25,472
Oh, God.

1194
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:27,441
OWWW!

1195
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,943
Relax. Hold still!

1196
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,177
It's going into my skull!

1197
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:33,180
Tasi, you know I don't think your babies

1198
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:34,949
should be smelling all those fumes...

1199
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,684
Owww.

1200
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,921
You ready, Ginger?

1201
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:43,924
Enough with the Aquanet!

1202
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:45,426
I feel like I'm in drag.

1203
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,931
Have you no respect for my masterpiece?!

1204
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:52,933
I worked two hours on that hair -

1205
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:55,169
as if my fingers were
not swollen enough.

1206
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,438
Don't mess with the pregnant lady.

1207
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:59,940
Damn, woman. You look hot!

1208
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:01,442
I've forgotten all my moves.

1209
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:02,943
I got moves.

1210
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:03,944
I know you do.

1211
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:05,679
Down, girls, we've got a competition

1212
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,181
to get kicked out of.

1213
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:08,949
Let's go get your number.

1214
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,417
Do you really think
we'll get kicked out?

1215
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:12,453
Mmmm...

1216
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:28,202
This couple here...
lovely, lovely lines.

1217
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:29,937
And this couple here...

1218
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:31,939
not so much.

1219
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,175
Campari and Saunders.

1220
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:37,945
Oh, Tasi, dear...
You've changed partners.

1221
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:40,180
I wondered when...

1222
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:43,183
Oh, Toni...

1223
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:45,452
- Cedric.
- Mimi.

1224
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:47,921
- You're not competing?
- No. I am.

1225
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:49,188
You are?

1226
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:50,958
Like that?

1227
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:52,726
But with whom, dear?

1228
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:54,194
With my partner, Mona Saunders.

1229
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,930
She's on your sheet.
May we have our number please?

1230
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,435
I don't think so.

1231
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:03,971
Is this some sort of joke to you?

1232
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,941
This event is a serious competition

1233
01:24:07,942 --> 01:24:10,177
for serious dancers.

1234
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:13,714
Why, in all my years, I have never...

1235
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,182
I would never...

1236
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:16,183
Where is Sheri?

1237
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:17,418
Where is your mother?

1238
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:19,186
Even she wouldn't approve of this.

1239
01:24:19,187 --> 01:24:21,188
I mean, my God, to think...

1240
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:23,190
Whatever happened to Tasi?

1241
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:25,459
Oh, I see.

1242
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,927
How unfortunate.

1243
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:27,728
Is there a problem?

1244
01:24:27,929 --> 01:24:29,930
Oh, you'd better believe
there's a problem.

1245
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:31,698
Well, I'm just going to have to go

1246
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:33,934
speak to the judges about this.

1247
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:35,436
You do that, Mrs. Orlo.

1248
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:39,173
Man the check-in table, Missy.

1249
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:40,707
Yes, ma'am!

1250
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:43,944
Yeah, it looks like
we're getting kicked out.

1251
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:45,446
Ooo, this is fun!

1252
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:48,449
I'm just sorry you're
not gonna have a chance

1253
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,184
to show them how amazing you are.

1254
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:53,687
You want a number?
I'll get you a number.

1255
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:55,422
You wanna dance, Missy?

1256
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:56,957
No, ma'am.

1257
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:59,693
Get this on her! They're starting!

1258
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:02,930
I love you. You're crazy.

1259
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,165
You too.
We learned from the best, right?

1260
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:08,235
You can knock a Campari girl up,
but you can't knock her down.

1261
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:09,703
Now knock 'em dead!

1262
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:24,685
Couple number 11,

1263
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:28,956
please exit the dance area
and approach the judges' table.

1264
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,924
Couple number 11.

1265
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:33,160
Oh, it is on!

1266
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:34,428
No!

1267
01:25:34,429 --> 01:25:36,430
No, no, no, no, no!

1268
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:38,432
This is not happening!

1269
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,701
We are dancing here!

1270
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:42,936
Oh, now it's on.

1271
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:48,442
Sheri, you cannot honestly
support this charade.

1272
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,444
It makes a mockery out of everything

1273
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:53,180
that we have worked so hard to build.

1274
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:54,915
Don't 'we' me, Mimi.

1275
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:57,451
The only problem we have here
is this unfortunate pause

1276
01:25:57,452 --> 01:25:59,453
in my daughter's performance.

1277
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:00,187
Please, Sheri...

1278
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:01,455
She-ree!

1279
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:03,190
Mrs. Campari!

1280
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:07,694
You have to understand
how irregular this is.

1281
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:11,431
We can't allow a couple of
this nature on the dance floor.

1282
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:14,434
It's... it's not natural.

1283
01:26:14,435 --> 01:26:17,437
I'm afraid that couple number 11
is disqualified.

1284
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:21,942
Disqualified?

1285
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:24,444
Am I hearing you correctly, George?

1286
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:27,447
Please do not make a scene here.

1287
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:29,183
Mom, it's OK.

1288
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,451
It is not OK!

1289
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:35,222
My daughter does not get disqualified!

1290
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:39,426
How can you sit there and judge
anything but dancing?

1291
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:43,430
Where in the by-laws
does it say what's regular?

1292
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:45,699
It says lead and follow.

1293
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,469
The pronouns are extraperfluous.

1294
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:53,440
Actually, right here on page 26,
it clearly states...

1295
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:55,209
Oh, stuff your by-laws!

1296
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,177
Who reads that poopyscoot anyway?

1297
01:26:57,178 --> 01:26:59,413
I'm talking about competing here.

1298
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:01,915
If we bar them from dancing,
next thing you know

1299
01:27:02,183 --> 01:27:04,685
you'll disqualify couple
number 29 because he's ugly,

1300
01:27:04,686 --> 01:27:07,187
or Jeff and Cindy, because of her shoes.

1301
01:27:07,188 --> 01:27:09,423
I mean really, did you see them?

1302
01:27:09,424 --> 01:27:10,691
She can't dance.

1303
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:12,426
She can't possibly perform in those.

1304
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:13,694
Mom!

1305
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:15,696
No. We can win this.

1306
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:20,167
My daughter has been training
to lead her whole life -

1307
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:22,436
longer than any of these amateurs.

1308
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:24,171
It's happening.

1309
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:25,939
You're damn right it's happening!

1310
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:28,175
My daughter is dancing here!

1311
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:30,677
No! Your daughter is having babies.

1312
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:32,179
Now?!

1313
01:27:33,715 --> 01:27:35,449
Anastasia, only one guest!

1314
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:36,450
Not her!

1315
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:38,952
- Who the heck is Anastasia?
- Shut up, Ced!

1316
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:03,203
Now, Tasi,

1317
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:06,206
I want you to take
a big breath in and a big push,

1318
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:08,442
just like the last one, OK?

1319
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:09,710
Yeah!

1320
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:11,211
Alright, here we go.

1321
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:12,713
Big breath in...

1322
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:14,448
And push!

1323
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:41,675
...5, 6, 7, 8, ah 1, 2, 3, 4...

1324
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:06,933
Oh, no, no, no!

1325
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:09,436
You can't smoke in here!

1326
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:12,438
Oh, really? Is that so, then?

1327
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:15,742
Exactly where does one
go to relieve oneself?

1328
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:17,711
Well, there's a bathroom
at the end of the hall,

1329
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:19,179
but you can't smoke there either.

1330
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:20,914
In fact, you can't smoke within 20 feet

1331
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:22,716
of any hospital entrance!

1332
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:24,684
Mercy. I'm in hell.

1333
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:27,921
I have officially entered hell.

1334
01:30:44,705 --> 01:30:46,473
OK...

1335
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:50,444
Now, push.

1336
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:51,945
Ready to push?

1337
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:54,414
OK, you're gonna push...

1338
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:58,952
Push! Push! Push!

1339
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:01,421
That's it. Good girl!

1340
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:03,190
I can see the top of the head!

1341
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:04,691
Now with this next contraction,

1342
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:06,927
we could really make some progress.

1343
01:31:06,928 --> 01:31:08,195
Holy...

1344
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:10,697
Ced, stay with me! I need you here!

1345
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:12,933
You're doin' so good, baby.

1346
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:15,469
You're doin' soooo good! Come on!

1347
01:31:58,179 --> 01:31:59,913
Toni, your frame's a mess.

1348
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:00,914
And, Mona...

1349
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:02,716
They're perfect!

1350
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:05,418
They're... Ceddie?

1351
01:32:05,419 --> 01:32:07,454
The babies? They're here?!

1352
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:08,421
That's right, Grammy.

1353
01:32:08,422 --> 01:32:10,924
Oooooh!

1354
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:12,425
There we go!

1355
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:15,428
Oooh, my God!

1356
01:32:41,956 --> 01:32:44,424
She loves them so much.

1357
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,694
Well done.

1358
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:55,435
Did I scare you?

1359
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:56,703
Did grandma scare you?

1360
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:04,945
1-2-3, 2-2-3... 1-2-3, 2-2-3...

1361
01:33:04,946 --> 01:33:07,714
And so it begins...

1362
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:12,919
Ah 5, 6, 7, 8...

1363
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:23,697
* The weather here is perfect *

1364
01:33:23,965 --> 01:33:27,200
* I'll lay it out frame by frame *

1365
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:30,937
* I'll write a plea for you to visit *

1366
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:42,182
* On a 4x6 cardstock with your name... *

1367
01:33:42,183 --> 01:33:45,685
* I know you can't see it *

1368
01:33:45,686 --> 01:33:48,955
* But the grass out here is greener *

1369
01:33:49,173 --> 01:33:58,932
* I'll remember this picture *

1370
01:33:58,933 --> 01:34:01,167
* Oh...

1371
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:04,938
* How I wish you were here *

1372
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:09,442
* The air is cool

1373
01:34:09,443 --> 01:34:12,712
* At the wrong time of year *

1374
01:34:12,713 --> 01:34:16,182
* Did you see

1375
01:34:16,183 --> 01:34:19,953
* On the bottom

1376
01:34:19,954 --> 01:34:24,691
* The red and white lines

1377
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:27,694
* The postman's calling you

1378
01:34:27,695 --> 01:34:35,702
* To my skyline...

1379
01:34:35,703 --> 01:34:38,938
* My return address

1380
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:42,208
* Would really be complete

1381
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:49,449
* If you were right here with me *

1382
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:52,919
* So I'll peel the stamp

1383
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:56,923
* And write persuasively

1384
01:34:56,924 --> 01:35:00,427
* "I don't really live here" *

1385
01:35:00,428 --> 01:35:06,933
* But I swear it feels like home *

1386
01:35:06,934 --> 01:35:11,204
* How I wish you were here *

1387
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:15,175
* The air is cool

1388
01:35:15,176 --> 01:35:18,178
* At the wrong time of year *

1389
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:21,915
* Did you see

1390
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:25,919
* On the bottom

1391
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:30,390
* The red and white lines

1392
01:35:30,424 --> 01:35:33,193
* The postman's calling you

1393
01:35:33,427 --> 01:35:36,929
* To my skyline...

1394
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:31,184
* I swear it feels like home... *

1395
01:37:24,205 --> 01:37:27,674
* Family can't be trusted

1396
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:31,177
* The weather changes too

1397
01:37:31,412 --> 01:37:34,681
* You need something permanent *

1398
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:38,418
* To set your dreams with glue *

1399
01:37:38,419 --> 01:37:41,621
* I can't promise heaven

1400
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:45,391
* That's something only God can do *

1401
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:48,428
* But if you want to talk to him *

1402
01:37:48,429 --> 01:37:51,931
* I'll make sure your
call gets through *

1403
01:37:51,932 --> 01:38:00,139
* 'Cause you belong to me... *

1404
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:02,141
* God said I could have you *

1405
01:38:02,142 --> 01:38:10,149
* You belong to me

1406
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:14,153
* Now, your mother used to hold you *

1407
01:38:14,154 --> 01:38:17,156
* Every time you cried

1408
01:38:17,424 --> 01:38:21,394
* And your neighbors used
to check up on you *

1409
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:24,397
* When you tried to hide

1410
01:38:24,398 --> 01:38:27,901
* Now, your mother cannot hear you *

1411
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:31,905
* And the neighbors moved away *

1412
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:35,675
* So listen very closely

1413
01:38:35,676 --> 01:38:38,144
* To every word I say

1414
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:46,419
* 'Cause you belong to me... *

1415
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:48,655
* God said I can have you *

1416
01:38:48,889 --> 01:38:53,927
* You belong to me...

1417
01:38:53,928 --> 01:39:01,167
* You belong to me

1418
01:39:01,168 --> 01:39:03,169
* God said I could have you *

1419
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:06,906
* You belong to me...

1420
01:40:35,129 --> 01:40:38,431
* Call me when you're lonely *

1421
01:40:38,432 --> 01:40:41,901
* Call me when you're down *

1422
01:40:41,902 --> 01:40:44,904
* My door is always open *

1423
01:40:44,905 --> 01:40:48,908
* And there's always more around *

1424
01:40:49,176 --> 01:40:52,412
* If you come for answers

1425
01:40:52,413 --> 01:40:56,149
* You'll have to wait in line *

1426
01:40:56,150 --> 01:40:59,919
* But if you come for earthly things *

1427
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,422
* I'll show you a good time *

1428
01:41:02,423 --> 01:41:10,396
* 'Cause you belong to me... *

1429
01:41:10,664 --> 01:41:12,899
* God said I could have you *

1430
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:17,403
* You belong to me

1431
01:41:17,404 --> 01:41:25,144
* You belong...
