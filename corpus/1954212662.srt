1
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,524
I know you.

2
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,092
But you're not here to see me.

3
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,173
Someone will hear us. They must.

4
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,576
I mean, no one wants me to die.

5
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:33,741
Someone will hear us.

6
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,821
Is someone there?

7
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,193
Please. I have a wife.

8
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,929
A wife or a secretary?

9
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,954
Don't make me.

10
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,187
Don't make me...
I wasn't going to shoot you.

11
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,625
But now I have to.

12
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,696
Why?

13
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,131
You tried to kill me.

14
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,437
No, I didn't.

15
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,538
And you'll try again if I let you go.

16
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,142
- No, I won't. I promise.
- I don't believe you.

17
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,413
A man's word...

18
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,385
I don't want to die.

19
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,521
It's part of a process.

20
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,480
I can pay you.

21
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,220
It's not me you should have paid.

22
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,195
Anyway, you talk too much to shoot me.

23
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,943
After killing, I used to have to wait
an hour or so before I could eat.

24
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,879
Cuter than when you were ten.

25
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,252
I suppose that's progress.

26
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,722
You grew up different than I thought.

27
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,435
But so did I.

28
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,146
You don't have to say anything.

29
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,617
Michelle, how much of the
forest do you remember?

30
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,560
I remember it was autumn.

31
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,709
Never give this back to me.

32
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,181
How's the English coming?

33
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,657
I have a new teacher.

34
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,054
I would practice with you,
but it gives me a headache.

35
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,752
You can still practice with me.

36
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,385
And how do you say "eye"?

37
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:22,851
Drink?

38
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,631
Same as last time.

39
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,539
What's this?

40
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,314
Superstructural fittings, a fuse,
an initiating charge...

41
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,351
a main charge of high explosives
and a bomb case.

42
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,817
We wanted it assembled.

43
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,582
So assemble it.

44
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,132
The other half of my payment?

45
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,076
Now?

46
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,712
You have something better to do?

47
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,757
Present perfect tense expresses
action which began in the past...

48
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,698
but continues in the present.

49
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,820
Past perfect tense expresses action
which began in the past...

50
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,849
and was completed in the past.

51
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,641
Come on.

52
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:30,619
Future perfect tense expresses action
which will begin in the future,

53
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,918
and be completed by a specific
time in the future.

54
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,141
You must be kidding!

55
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,974
Don't be rude.

56
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,201
Behave.

57
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,470
Help!

58
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,558
We won't say anything about this.

59
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,641
She just left.

60
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,293
Always making a racket.

61
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,428
It's a talent.

62
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,757
- Depends on your line of work.
- Wait.

63
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,330
In horseracing today,
the results from Vincennes:

64
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:28,201
The third race was won easily
by number 16, Avril Doré.

65
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,438
Got any money I can borrow?

66
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,952
That's too much.

67
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,457
That's okay, take it.

68
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,095
I'll pay you back.

69
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,395
You working?

70
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,406
You looking?

71
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,600
Really?

72
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,881
I saw Michelle Tillier again.

73
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,476
You want to get a drink?

74
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,009
No, I'm going to see her.

75
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,337
Why don't you come?

76
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,679
- Me?
- Yeah.

77
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,135
Jean-Pierre!

78
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,274
Best just to let him go.

79
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,509
Like you know what's best.

80
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,274
It's been a long time.

81
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,547
Got any money I can borrow?

82
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,989
That's too much.

83
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,361
You're right.

84
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,104
I'll pay you back.

85
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,070
I won't hold my breath.

86
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,705
You're mixed up in something.

87
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,451
And you're not?

88
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,085
Not like you.

89
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,581
You trying to make me feel better?

90
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,722
Sorry.

91
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,434
Is this business?

92
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,937
All business. Nothing personal.

93
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,092
Do I know you?

94
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,712
Who do you work for?

95
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,915
How can you live like this?

96
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,016
It doesn't help with you dropping
your garbage about.

97
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,091
You're an incredibly stupid man.

98
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,356
Do you know who I am?

99
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,190
The English teacher.

100
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,795
I don't have many students anymore.

101
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,677
Michelle.

102
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,750
Oh... that.

103
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,454
I knew it was something.

104
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,584
Thought you were here to kill me
or something...

105
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,386
in your big black coat and everything.

106
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,489
The thing is, that was something
that just happened.

107
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,761
I guess I wasn't thinking.

108
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,500
Just like I'm not thinking now.

109
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:30,631
I should warn you that I work for
a certain type of professional.

110
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,806
- Sure.
- I'm armed.

111
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,569
So am I.

112
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,343
Which leg?

113
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,682
The tibia is a big bone and will heal quickly...

114
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,648
but it will always hurt on cold days like today.

115
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,260
Let's go. This one here.

116
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,433
It is you who is stupid.

117
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,199
Scream as loud as she did.

118
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,576
No one will hurt you again.

119
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,878
Okay.

120
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,097
One, two, three...

121
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,793
four, five, six...

122
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:35,704
seven, eight, nine, ten!

123
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,903
Do you know why we're here?

124
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,712
All the hotels were full?

125
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,277
Why did you break his leg?
He wouldn't tell us.

126
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,028
Legs are important.

127
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,558
How many hits did it take?

128
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,561
Why didn't you finish him off?

129
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,534
There must be a weakness in you.

130
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,199
Then why don't you try letting me go?

131
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:26,971
Careful.

132
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,814
Seeing how you owe me
for the English teacher...

133
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,949
I'd like you to do something for me.

134
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,249
I'm not interested.

135
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,348
It's not breaking anyone's leg.

136
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,228
I want you to find something that's missing.

137
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,141
Missing or stolen?

138
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,944
Both.

139
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,480
What's inside?

140
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,123
None of your business.

141
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,995
You would have been dead.

142
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,218
You've got the wrong guy.

143
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,083
You can help me or not, but one
way or another you owe me.

144
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,994
I hate to be hit!

145
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,960
You can kill him, but I'll shoot you.

146
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,689
There's a weakness in me, remember?

147
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,991
Obviously temporary.

148
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,470
The fridge is full, make yourself at home.

149
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,984
Woman?

150
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,919
One cannot be blessed every night.

151
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:26,254
I can't go to my place anymore.
It has rats.

152
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,558
You need a good exterminator.

153
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,616
What did you think of Michelle?

154
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,916
I don't know.
A woman who gets beat up like that...

155
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,816
Everyone has to go through
whatever they have to go through.

156
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,018
Even you?

157
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,856
Especially me.

158
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,259
Me?

159
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,429
Yes, you, too.

160
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,033
Heard anything about a missing briefcase?

161
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,071
Why?

162
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,912
Everybody's been asking me.

163
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,775
You're a good person to ask.

164
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,449
A little bit too good.

165
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,117
It's a talent.

166
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,254
Depends on your line of work.

167
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,795
Thanks for the ride.

168
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,127
Tell him I'll pay him his money.

169
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,834
Relax, he knows you're my friend.

170
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,853
Smells good.

171
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,849
Indeed.

172
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,761
A little more thyme, please.

173
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,996
I don't tell you how to break heads,
so please don't tell me how to cook.

174
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,972
Somebody asked me about a briefcase.

175
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,506
A briefcase?

176
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,501
Is it yours?

177
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,446
Then you shouldn't concern yourself.

178
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,447
I was just curious.

179
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,987
That's not like you.

180
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,220
So you haven't heard anything?

181
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,260
Some customers were speaking
about a briefcase.

182
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:38,629
What did they say?

183
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,665
I don't know, it was busy.

184
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,823
The waiter couldn't eavesdrop
as much as he would have liked.

185
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,232
People speak at a dinner table.
You have to remember more.

186
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,977
All I have to do is cook.

187
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,923
You're right.
It doesn't need more thyme.

188
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,722
Of course.

189
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,636
They said something about a briefcase
being thrown in the trash.

190
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,136
Has the trash been picked up yet?

191
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,914
You're all dirty.

192
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,858
Was there anybody here in the last few days?

193
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,239
Every day I wake up frightened.

194
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,806
Just like you.

195
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,475
Did you find anything?

196
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,054
Somebody probably just made a mistake.

197
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,520
Just like you're making one now.

198
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,359
How did the job in the forest go?

199
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,553
He owed me money.

200
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,348
Why is he still alive?

201
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,751
Being in the forest again...

202
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,025
I know.

203
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,589
But I trusted you.

204
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:54,175
Put him out of his misery.
Do me a favor.

205
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,660
Of course you're angry.

206
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,430
But so am I.

207
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,453
Don't touch me, I'm dirty.

208
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,543
What happened?

209
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,943
I quit my day job.

210
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,347
Oh, shit.

211
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,487
"Oh, shit" is right.

212
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:57,632
Come.

213
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,242
Slowly.

214
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,348
- Will you be joining me?
- Of course.

215
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:33,476
I sometimes blame all my
violent tendencies on...

216
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,382
Violent tendencies?

217
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,851
Violent.

218
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,753
So the next generation trying to
muscle their way into the business.

219
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:08,760
That's right.

220
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,697
New, but not improved.

221
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,201
Some things don't need improving.

222
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,703
It's a game of character.

223
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:36,215
The rules are simple, but precise.

224
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:31,411
I have a choice. I can either get
myself closer, or knock you away.

225
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,510
This is the part that always
reveals people's nature.

226
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,698
Wasn't your ball a little further over?

227
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,534
I don't know. You think?

228
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,301
Should we measure?

229
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,179
Like me, you might have to learn
the game the hard way.

230
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:23,395
I don't know where she is.
She always came to my place.

231
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,465
Who would know?

232
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,604
It's not who would know.

233
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,634
It's who would tell you.

234
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,109
What am I supposed to do with this?

235
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:42,480
I'm sure it can't be too hard to assemble.

236
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,691
You need some crutches.

237
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,261
But I'm saving this for Jean-Pierre.

238
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,805
I'll sign his cast.

239
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,611
Did anyone follow you here?

240
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,541
Of course not.

241
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,586
SHIT

242
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,764
I can't say that I'm completely
sorry to see you.

243
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,329
You'll change your mind.

244
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,394
You want to go get a drink?

245
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,767
You think Noel would approve?

246
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,579
Don't get mixed up in his affairs.

247
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,989
That's why you're here.

248
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,926
I would be careful.

249
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,824
Why the concern?

250
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,332
I'm just trying to avoid
carrying out the next step.

251
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,766
She must like you.

252
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,840
It worked, you coming here.

253
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,375
I'm going to get serious.

254
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:27,053
I said "careful", not "serious".

255
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,470
I settle disagreements in a bad way.

256
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,673
Right now we are disagreeing.

257
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,677
14-to-1, three races...

258
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,008
- How much do I owe?
- A lot.

259
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,991
You think this is a good idea?

260
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:12,962
You sure?

261
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,368
Okay, but we split the winnings.

262
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,400
I mean it.

263
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:04,081
Just one more race.
I've got enough.

264
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,086
I promise, I've got enough!

265
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:24,574
I think they must have painted it blue
to look like the sky.

266
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,141
How do you feel?

267
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,982
I don't know, I haven't tried to move yet.

268
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,986
Then don't.

269
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,295
You want some?

270
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,436
No more apples.

271
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,038
What's all this?

272
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,844
What I see.

273
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,951
I want to remember everything I've seen.

274
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,352
I do everything I can to forget.

275
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,625
Well, not everything...

276
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,121
What do you want me to say?

277
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:41,357
If you can't talk to me, who can you talk to?

278
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,270
True.

279
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,104
Where did you get the case?

280
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,508
It's not all that simple.

281
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,974
Simon showed me how to
make some extra money.

282
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,888
He was good at those things.

283
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,860
Simon had found the briefcase.

284
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,833
It was an accident.

285
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,139
Who was Simon?

286
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,076
It's not important.

287
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:04,112
We shared cigarettes and drank together.

288
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,013
I didn't love him.

289
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:21,961
It never snows when you want it to.

290
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,501
Do you know what you've done?

291
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,045
We shouldn't open that.

292
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:00,632
You need to leave.

293
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:02,735
Now.

294
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,180
What?

295
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:00,720
Nothing.

296
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:02,347
Yeah, nothing.

297
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:16,362
Straight across is America.
We could always go there.

298
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,272
And leave France?

299
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:21,775
Absolutely.

300
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:30,486
We can split up and try to meet,
or go on together.

301
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:32,553
What do you want to do?

302
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:35,787
It's up to you.

303
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:08,753
Brittany has nice crepes.

304
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:15,624
Delicious.

305
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,461
Then I better come with you.

306
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,098
I don't know who set the bomb.

307
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,929
It's just as important to know who didn't.

308
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:06,503
It wasn't me.

309
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:07,843
And you...

310
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,808
Why didn't you speak up when
Claude cheated at pétanque?

311
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:14,475
I didn't necessarily want you to win.

312
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:26,060
I'm thinking about leaving for a while.

313
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,656
Leaving?

314
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,859
Okay.

315
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:38,705
It's okay?

316
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,078
Yes.

317
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:56,550
When you were a kid, did you ever play
that game where you fall back?

318
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,491
What?

319
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:05,366
The game where you fall back and trust
the person behind you to catch you?

320
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,100
I don't like games.

321
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,705
They can teach you a lot.

322
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:14,371
I'll catch you. Close your eyes.

323
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,538
Just try it.

324
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,283
I can't.

325
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,624
Trust me.

326
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,613
When I fell, no one caught me.

327
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:59,751
I called a taxi earlier.

328
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,189
Why don't you take it?

329
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,293
No more games.

330
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,432
You look Ionely.

331
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:18,574
Just tired.

332
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,117
He didn't ask to see me?

333
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,706
That's a nice restaurant.

334
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:59,348
My girlfriend and I used to
go there for omelets.

335
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,553
When we were still going out.

336
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:12,017
That means I'm single.

337
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:47,094
THE TAXI DRIVER

338
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:28,594
You look tired.

339
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:38,479
Just Ionely.

340
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:00,999
Andre said to mention his name.

341
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,735
I'm warning you.
No drugs here.

342
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:10,840
We need a nice room with a big bed.

343
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:17,982
We don't like you either.

344
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:21,454
He just doesn't know us yet.

345
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,785
Our first hotel room.

346
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:00,125
Hopefully, our last hotel room.

347
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:06,696
Bastard.

348
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,675
That's okay, we weren't going to pay anyway.

349
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,408
Who gets the bed?

350
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:25,483
I'll arm-wrestle you for it.

351
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:28,390
Are you serious?

352
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,260
But you can't possibly win.

353
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,327
Hey, no cheating.

354
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,629
I don't need to cheat. Ready?

355
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:44,529
- Do you want me to try for real?
- For real.

356
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:57,746
I'll just outlast you.

357
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,085
Never.

358
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:18,073
Sometimes we're like kids.

359
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,979
Except we know more.

360
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:30,444
I haven't told you what's inside the briefcase.

361
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,324
I don't care what's inside.

362
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:44,256
What's inside?

363
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,527
A key.

364
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,670
- What else?
- That's it.

365
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,938
A key to what?

366
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,107
A locker.

367
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:53,467
What's in the locker?

368
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,078
Something important.

369
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:59,240
Either tell me or don't.

370
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:03,317
I don't know. It's important enough
to keep a key in a briefcase.

371
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,185
It's locked.

372
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:12,384
I can see that.
What's the combination?

373
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:13,721
I don't know.

374
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:15,294
Then how do you know what's inside?

375
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:16,864
Simon told me.

376
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,766
Why did you take it anyway?

377
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:22,797
I was curious.

378
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,803
You can't get away with things like that.

379
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,410
Sometimes I can.

380
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:30,643
So can you.

381
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:33,008
Don't you think someone will want it back?

382
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:35,841
Don't you think I know what I'm doing?

383
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,690
We're going to lose each other
because of that briefcase.

384
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:08,480
We're not going to lose each other.

385
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:33,598
Thank you.

386
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:39,139
I wish we had that drink.

387
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:00,723
The only rule is that you can't touch my ball.

388
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,235
You're not showing any respect.

389
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,733
I'm trying.

390
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:19,341
And I'm trying to see that you don't
end up dead in the gutter.

391
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:22,284
The gutter isn't so bad.

392
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:24,276
But being dead is.

393
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,393
Let's start with what you know.

394
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,161
Then we'll move on to how you can help me.

395
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:38,159
Trust me, I wouldn't be much help.

396
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,270
We'll forget about the money you owe.

397
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:46,964
Stop it.

398
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:48,337
I haven't done anything yet.

399
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,069
I'm innocent.

400
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,914
The first sign of guilt.

401
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,351
Careful.

402
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,253
I don't like to lose.

403
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,351
It's your turn.

404
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,012
You slept well.

405
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,582
You're up early.

406
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:23,254
Scouting our next hotel.

407
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:27,825
Looks Ionely.

408
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:30,096
It is.

409
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:35,695
- I'm tired of this photo crap.
- You should've told me earlier.

410
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:51,643
Where's the briefcase?

411
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:49,633
It's you that wanted to put him
out of his misery.

412
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:52,112
Strange that you pay your respects.

413
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:59,020
It's the least I can do.
It's because of me that he is here.

414
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:02,453
It's because of both of us.

415
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:06,183
The guilt will fade.

416
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:10,990
Or become a part of me.

417
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:17,669
Here. Maybe you'll be the one
putting them on my grave?

418
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:20,775
And maybe it won't be too long.

419
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:22,638
You're not old.

420
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,904
You don't have to be old to die.

421
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,877
But it helps.

422
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:33,544
You're so young.

423
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,787
You can always tell by the hands.

424
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,187
Somebody cut me when I was young.

425
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:42,958
It made me old.

426
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:47,335
How did the job in the taxi go?

427
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:51,498
He got away.

428
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,138
On his own, or did you let him?

429
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:57,104
Claude.

430
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:01,482
I let him.

431
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:04,546
Do me a favor.

432
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:08,078
Favors are serious.

433
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:09,416
Yes, favors are serious.

434
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:10,888
Don't cut me!

435
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:13,886
What kind of man do you think I am?

436
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:15,529
Old.

437
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,193
You'll take responsibility for your mistake?

438
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:22,703
Yes!

439
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,543
We're going to need some more flowers.

440
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:25,525
I've been waiting a long time.

441
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:28,930
It's difficult to wait.

442
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:32,933
Claude wants to see you.

443
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:34,932
Tell him to wait.

444
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:38,069
You're always so...

445
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:41,883
He's always so what?

446
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:44,511
Indifferent.

447
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,886
There doesn't seem to be anything
indifferent about your leg.

448
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:00,926
Terrible.

449
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:05,498
How long do you normally have
to wait before you can eat?

450
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:10,668
Eating isn't the problem.
It's the sleep.

451
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,814
It's everything.

452
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:19,847
I actually feel bad hitting a cripple.

453
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:22,586
Then don't think of him as a cripple.

454
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:36,663
Shoot her.
I'm just a messenger.

455
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:38,305
Shoot both of you.

456
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:40,031
Noel asked for you.

457
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:43,003
Doesn't mean she has to
walk out of here alive.

458
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:46,671
I would owe you a favor.

459
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:52,053
Favors are serious.

460
01:19:57,058 --> 01:19:58,252
Deal.

461
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:10,368
With him, I won't sleep for a week.

462
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,537
That's the price for being... indifferent.

463
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:38,829
Maybe it doesn't look so bad...

464
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,036
You look terrible.

465
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,034
You think?

466
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:53,347
Do you know where Michelle is?

467
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:55,075
No.

468
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,308
Heard anything?

469
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:01,221
How well do you know Michelle?

470
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:03,186
What do you mean?

471
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:05,116
Never mind. I see you're in a bad mood.

472
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:07,458
Getting worse by the minute.

473
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:15,766
Can I stay at your place for a couple of days?

474
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:17,798
Sorry, but I have a new girlfriend.

475
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:32,218
Your girlfriend, is she nice?

476
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:33,717
What do you want me to do?

477
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:04,351
You look pale.

478
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,378
I am.

479
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:08,819
It's just a broken window.
Let's get back in the car.

480
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:09,888
Are we done?

481
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:11,525
Come on. It's cold out here.

482
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:13,183
But I trusted you...

483
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:16,629
If you move, I will shoot you,
and I don't want to.

484
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:18,627
I believe you.

485
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:20,194
Why did you do it?

486
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:24,997
The money.

487
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,929
The combo has been changed.

488
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:50,498
What is it?

489
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:51,723
I don't know.

490
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:55,394
I said, what's the combination?

491
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:57,368
You're repeating yourself.

492
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:00,363
So it starts...

493
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,442
Just answer his questions.

494
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:05,738
And what?
You'll just let me walk away?

495
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:09,016
We'll let Michelle live.

496
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:13,620
She's probably the only one
who knows the combination.

497
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:29,937
What's the combination?

498
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,366
Michelle doesn't tell me anything.

499
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:35,509
And you don't ask.

500
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:48,450
They're so dumb.

501
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:50,250
Yeah, aren't they?

502
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:56,256
One of you knows the combination.

503
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,872
Which one do I have to hurt
before the other tells me?

504
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:10,874
Now you're being rude.

505
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,138
Start with him.

506
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:18,782
Now how are you going to untie him?

507
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:28,058
He may not be a thinker,
but he's a great hitter.

508
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,026
He does it the right way.

509
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:32,028
Looks like someone just
did it to him the right way.

510
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:43,000
Let me know when you're ready to talk.

511
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:46,310
I hate to be hit.

512
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:07,557
Take off the gloves.

513
01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:13,567
Six, one, nine.

514
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:15,305
What?

515
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:16,774
Six, one, nine.

516
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:18,279
Careful.

517
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,481
I mean, it's probably nothing...

518
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:26,153
but someone might have booby-trapped it
with explosives or something.

519
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:30,489
- Someone like you?
- Someone exactly like me.

520
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:35,354
You.

521
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:37,421
Open it.

522
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:42,865
You think I'm stupid?

523
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:49,341
Have him open it.

524
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,678
You've just made an incredibly huge mistake.

525
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:15,151
Wait.

526
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:18,962
Not until we check the key.

527
01:27:30,478 --> 01:27:32,207
Here's the money I owe.

528
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:35,248
You said you would pay me back.
I'm just holding you to your word.

529
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:36,439
Thanks.

530
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:40,119
You should get help for your problem.

531
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:41,615
It's not a problem.

532
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:45,385
I see. But you've been avoiding me.

533
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:47,851
Wouldn't you?

534
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:51,128
Probably.

535
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:54,961
Maybe I can lend you a hand...

536
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:57,060
Lend a hand?

537
01:27:57,205 --> 01:27:59,230
You know, whatever you need.

538
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:02,475
It's probably not a good idea.

539
01:28:03,077 --> 01:28:04,738
I need to lend a hand.

540
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:10,508
Need can be great.

541
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:11,913
Exactly.

542
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,089
- You sure?
- Yes.

543
01:28:17,525 --> 01:28:19,493
You'll wait here to see who shows up.

544
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,353
That's for the money?

545
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:25,499
The money is for what comes after.

546
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:33,340
Okay.

547
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:37,570
That just leaves one more thing.

548
01:28:40,415 --> 01:28:43,942
Even though this is your choice,
you need something to remember.

549
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:46,311
No, I have a good memory.

550
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:48,751
Nothing is done to you that hasn't
already been done to me.

551
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:53,121
That doesn't make it right.

552
01:28:55,396 --> 01:28:56,886
That just makes it what it is.

553
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:03,698
Where are you going?

554
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:07,398
- I'll do anything you want.
- Just like Veronique?

555
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:38,564
You lied to me.

556
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:42,042
I lied to myself.

557
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:45,507
Do you want to know everything I've done?

558
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:49,179
No, it wouldn't matter if you told me.

559
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:54,510
It's nice to see you again.

560
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:58,453
You, too.

561
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:02,790
We didn't lose each other.

562
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:06,660
Has Claude been gone a long time?

563
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:09,203
Don't worry about Claude.

564
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:14,200
There are five important parts
that make up a bomb.

565
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:19,847
Superstructural fittings:
Like fins, kopfrings, etc.

566
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,547
A fuse.

567
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:27,421
An initiating charge.

568
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:30,758
A main charge of high explosive.

569
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,991
And a container for holding the bomb.

570
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:51,245
There must be something else.

571
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:01,011
There would be something else,
if this was the right key.

572
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:09,522
Sometimes the tables turn...

573
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:14,165
the guilty becomes the victim of the injured.

574
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:19,873
Violence without conscience.

575
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:45,499
Where's Claude?

576
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,171
Noel wants to see you.

577
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:55,969
Don't go.

578
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:57,402
It'll be fine.

579
01:31:57,578 --> 01:31:59,546
Has anything ever been fine?

580
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:00,871
He doesn't have a choice.

581
01:32:01,048 --> 01:32:02,583
You don't have a choice.
He has a choice.

582
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:04,551
You've already taken the
choice away from me.

583
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,482
Stay in Metro Porte des Lilas until I come.

584
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:17,503
Relax, he likes you.

585
01:35:17,978 --> 01:35:19,775
Don't be naive.

586
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:57,217
I heard there was an explosion.

587
01:35:58,285 --> 01:35:59,650
It wasn't me.

588
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:02,514
I'm sure none of this has been you.

589
01:36:03,157 --> 01:36:05,625
But sometimes you have to bury a bone...

590
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:09,528
to see which dog digs it up.

591
01:36:09,897 --> 01:36:12,092
I don't care about the key or the briefcase.

592
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,230
That's the difference between
you and Michelle.

593
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:25,342
I told her that no one would hurt her again.

594
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:30,182
You shouldn't have told her that.
You limit your options.

595
01:36:34,522 --> 01:36:36,683
What kind of options do I have now?

596
01:36:39,226 --> 01:36:40,523
None.

597
01:37:56,737 --> 01:37:58,671
Everything is wrong.

598
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:04,530
I'll scream.

599
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,366
I know.

600
01:39:07,908 --> 01:39:09,671
Jean-Pierre is coming.

601
01:39:09,843 --> 01:39:11,572
Leave Jean-Pierre out of this.

602
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:17,640
You're going to mess everything up.

603
01:39:20,154 --> 01:39:22,019
It's not too late to do the right thing.

604
01:39:27,861 --> 01:39:29,488
Now it's too late.

605
01:39:30,364 --> 01:39:31,831
Andre, calm down.

606
01:39:32,566 --> 01:39:34,056
He cut me.

607
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:35,765
He's dead now.

608
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:38,268
I don't believe you.

609
01:39:38,405 --> 01:39:41,374
Have I ever done anything for
you to doubt my word?

610
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:46,738
No, but I've never been
on your bad side either.

611
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,881
You don't have to do this.

612
01:39:50,784 --> 01:39:52,752
It's too late. You'll kill me.

613
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,514
I won't. You have no idea what it's like.

614
01:39:57,257 --> 01:39:59,225
Unforgivable.

615
01:40:22,216 --> 01:40:23,945
I forgive you.

616
01:42:58,305 --> 01:43:01,968
Ever do something that you
really didn't want to do?

617
01:43:05,212 --> 01:43:07,339
Makes you feel ugly.

618
01:43:10,217 --> 01:43:13,277
And most of the time it's a mistake.

619
01:43:14,888 --> 01:43:17,516
I make lots of mistakes.

620
01:43:20,727 --> 01:43:22,854
Me, too.

621
01:44:15,015 --> 01:44:20,647
I need an ambulance. My boyfriend
just swallowed some poison.

622
01:44:21,321 --> 01:44:26,190
34 rue Dumoncel in the 14th. Sixth Floor.
His name is Andre Dupont.

623
01:44:34,368 --> 01:44:36,393
I won't be here when they come.

624
01:44:38,405 --> 01:44:41,374
Is there anyone you want
to speak to one last time?

625
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:43,076
What?

626
01:44:46,013 --> 01:44:47,640
You don't have much time.

627
01:44:49,182 --> 01:44:50,479
Why me?

628
01:44:52,252 --> 01:44:53,879
Mistakes.

629
01:44:57,090 --> 01:44:58,648
How could you?

630
01:45:00,927 --> 01:45:02,394
For the money.

631
01:45:02,562 --> 01:45:04,189
The money...

632
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:10,501
Plus I owed a favor.
