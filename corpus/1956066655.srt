1136
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:55,765
         and get started
      with the appetizers,

1137
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,902
starting, Sarah, with your dish,
 the ravioli with the sweet peas

1138
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,470
 and the delicious butter sauce.

1139
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,505
          First of all,
   I was particularly shocked

1140
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,841
      that you had to make
   that ravioli from scratch.

1141
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,544
   The edges felt a little bit
 stiffer than we would've liked,

1142
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:09,479
      but the dough itself
   was perfect and beautiful.

1143
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:10,880
        We would've liked
     a little bit more salt

1144
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,650
     and it would have been
 an absolute home run of a dish.

1145
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:15,385
           -Thank you.
      -Bradley, your dish,

1146
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:17,020
      which was, of course,
        the red snapper,

1147
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,521
     right out of the gates,
       we were blown away

1148
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,523
    by how perfectly prepared
         your fish was.

1149
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,092
  The salad was powerful, too,

1150
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:23,693
        but the red onion
        was overwhelming.

1151
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,196
 I think something that pungent,
        just shave it up

1152
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:27,831
       so that it has just
          that essence,

1153
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:30,767
        but again, it was
   a extremely masterful dish.

         well-seasoned,

1160

         unfortunately.

1164

      was really well done

1165
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,366
        and the other one
        was a little raw,

1166

    so it was a little like,
    ahh...not<i> exactly</i> there.

1167
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:10,507
So, when I think about desserts,
  I think about the sweet treat

1168

1175

         very, very hard

1176
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,261
