00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:32,173
Ah, good morning, Present.
Right on time, as usual.

2
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:34,676
Ah, as punctual
as the devil himself.

3
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:36,377
You know, I've never
understood that expression.

4
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:39,614
- I met the guy.
He's late for everything.
- Hmm.

5
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,982
Speaking of
"late for everything,"

6
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:44,919
you would think the Ghost
of Christmas Past would have
a better concept of time.

7
00:01:44,987 --> 00:01:47,622
You've got to love the irony.

8
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:51,292
Off the record, sir.

9
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,829
Have you noticed anything
<i>strange</i> about Past today?

10
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:56,797
What do you mean?

11
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:01,636
It just seems that every time
that I've talked to him,
he seems... distant.

12
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,538
He's always been distant.

13
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:05,607
Like over-distant.

Well!

15

Well, let's get this
over with.

You have a hot date?

17
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:15,316
Oh, I don't know, dear.
What are you doing later on?

18
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,884
Ghosts, please.

19
00:02:16,953 --> 00:02:18,286
Okay, let's hear it.

Mm-hmm.

at our house.

Do you know anything about
those two things dangling
from the mantle downstairs?

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,537
And what do those
"things" look like?

00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,506
They look like decorations.

78
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:09,874
It's just stockings.

00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,944
Stockings are
decorations, honey.

80
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,914
Are stockings a gateway into
more hardcore decorations?

this is funny.

It's just two red stockings.

00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,356

- Is it stupid?
- Yeah!

- Is it really stupid?
- Yeah!

to spread some holiday cheer.

- Whatever.

100
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:09,583
Jack was married in 1978
to one Alison Addison.

101
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:11,852
Has one daughter, Suzanne.

102
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,888
Born in 1990.

103
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,724
On December 24th, 1998,

104
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,227
Jack and Alison attended
Suzanne's Christmas pageant.

105
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,263
In the middle of the pageant,
Alison left to go
to the restroom.

106
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:26,367
She was taking a bit long,
so Jack went to check on her.

107
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:28,969
Only she wasn't
in the restroom.

108
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,604
She was in
the coat check room.

109
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:32,073
So?

110
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,642
- She was with Jack's dentist.
- Oh.

111
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,911
And they weren't
checking coats.

112
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,979
Ouch.

113
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:42,150
Jack and Alison were officially
divorced shortly thereafter.

114
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:44,818
She claiming she didn't want
to be married to a workaholic,

115
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:47,922
and he claiming he didn't want
to be married to a woman
who cheats on him.

116
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,692
She moved to London and
sees Suzanne once a year
during the holidays.

117
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:53,827
I know all this already.

118
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:55,796
Of course you do.
You know everything
that's happened.

119
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:59,100
I'm informing Present.
You know her... condition.

120
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,902
[Past]
I know, poor thing.

121
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:04,305
She'll forget all this
by tomorrow.

122
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:08,342
Doesn't it ever bother you
only knowing what is
and not what was?

123
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:12,846
Doesn't it ever bother you
only knowing what was
and not what is?

124
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:14,282
[Trevor]
All right, all right, please.

125
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,950
Can we get back
to the case at hand?

126
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,852
Now, since that night,
Jack has had a contempt
for Christmas

127
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,321
and forgotten
its true meaning,

128
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,490
causing him to be
chilly toward others

129
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:25,159
and weakening his relationship
with his daughter Suzanne.

130
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:27,695
Fascinating!

131
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:30,998
And completely
and utterly common.

132
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,302
Lots of people have lost
the true meaning of Christmas.

133
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,405
So what makes this--
What's his name?

134
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:39,840
- Jack.
- Ja-- Jack--

135
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:42,210
What makes him
this year's target?

136
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:46,046
Well, alphabetically speaking,
we are on the C's.

137
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:52,253
Yeah, the sleeve is about
a half short still,

138
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:54,488
and I wanted the collar
thicker, not thinner.

139
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,757
Yeah, by tomorrow.

140
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:59,027
Well, it's not a holiday
at my house.

141
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:01,362
If you can't do it,
I'll find someone
that will, okay?

142
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:03,631
- All right? Thank you.
- [hangs up]

143
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:06,200
- Mr. Cameron?
- Yes?

144
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:09,170
The workers were wondering
if they could leave
early today.

145
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,306
- Which workers?
- All of them.

146
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:13,874
All 79 workers
came in your office

147
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:15,343
and asked if they could
leave early today?

148
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:19,647
Sir, I volunteered to come in
and ask because, you know--

149
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:21,082
What is so special
about today?

150
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:24,018
Um, it's...
Christmas Eve?

151
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,353
Yeah, but besides that.

152
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,990
- Um, people want to shop.
- Uh-uh. See, as you know,

153
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:30,791
today is just like
any other day around here.

154
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,495
We all work our regular shifts,
and when we're done,
we can go home.

155
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:36,597
Yes, sir.

156
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,566
Also, the homeless shelter
called,

157
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,134
asking what time
they should stop by
to pick up the coats.

158
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:41,535
What coats?

159
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,904
The irregulars,
of course.

160
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:46,007
Oh, oh, yeah.
We're not doing that
this year.

161
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:47,541
What?

162
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,011
But this company has donated
the irregular coats
to the homeless

163
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,081
since your father
founded it in 1941.

164
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,284
Actually, I don't need
a Cameron Coat Company
history lesson right now.

165
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:58,719
We found a paying customer
for the irregulars.

166
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,921
The Guatemalan Army.
They bought 'em all.

167
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:03,057
They don't care if the epaulets
are upside-down or not.

168
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,960
They're not a very good army.
They'll probably only
wear 'em once.

169
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:08,629
So they get some decent coats,
we get a bucket of money.

170
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:10,064
Everybody wins.

171
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,599
Except
the freezing homeless.

172
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,667
Ms. Creed,
I am not heartless.

173
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:16,237
I'm gonna donate some coats
on the Fourth of July.

174
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,605
But it'll be
90 degrees in July!

175
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:20,141
Thank you!

176
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:23,844
Thank you.

177
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:34,055
As usual, you have
until midnight tonight
to complete the assignment.

178
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:36,323
Sounds pretty simple.
We make an appearance,

179
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:39,193
we show him the error
of his ways, and poof!

180
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:42,863
By morning he'll be singing
"Fa la la la la."

181
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:44,498
I hope it's that easy.

182
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,267
We need a success
on this assignment.

183
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,569
The head office
has been threatening

184
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:50,388
to close the Ghosts
of Christmas program,

185
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,356
due to ineffectiveness.

186
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,408
Ineffectiveness?

187
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:55,410
When have we been
ineffective?

188
00:09:55,478 --> 00:09:58,228
Hello! The Miami incident?

189
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,883
Ah! Hey, look, he could swim
when he was a kid.

190
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:03,484
Look, just stay sharp
this year.

191
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:06,220
The last thing we need
is to look bad.

192
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:08,989
Past, here's your
candy cane chronometer.

193
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:11,158
It's been preprogrammed
to take you back in time

194
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:13,093
to key points
in Jack's history.

195
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:15,430
Here are your
spectral snowflakes,

196
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:16,631
which will allow
you and the target

197
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,099
to remain transparent
while on the journey.

198
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,769
Ohh! I really need a smoke.

199
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,671
Do you have any
cigarettes in there?

200
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,173
- Ghosts can't smoke.
- Oh, please, Trevor.

201
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:27,925
What's it gonna do,
kill me again?

202
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,329
All right, then.
Synchronize watches.

203
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:36,267
Twelve-hour countdown
begins...

204
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,501
now.

205
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:43,841
Uh, you haven't told us
who the point person is
on the assignment.

206
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,678
Matthew Preston,
Jack's ex-business partner.

207
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,981
Died one year ago
in a freak accident
while on vacation.

208
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,650
What exactly do you mean
by "freak"?

209
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,586
Hey, what was I
supposed to do, huh?

210
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,189
For one thing,
keep your eye on the fish!

211
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,893
I looked away for one second,
I mean, come on!

212
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,227
Okay.

213
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:06,097
Let's get down to business,
shall we, Mr. Preston?

214
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,133
Uh, hmm.

215
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,601
We need your help.

216
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,804
What?

217
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,384
Good night, Mr. Cameron.

218
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,353
Yup, good night.

219
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,688
And Merry Christmas.

Cameron Coats.

223
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,836
Well, well, well.
What a surprise.
Working on Christmas Eve.

224
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,038
What do you want, Alison?

225
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,107
I'm calling to wish you
a Merry Christmas.

226
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,474
Well, there,
you said it.

227
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,045
Jack, are you
still wallowing
in the holiday spirit?

228
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,613
Did Suzie get
the gift I sent her?

229
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,982
Yes, she got the dress,
and we're both happy to know

230
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,917
there's a Hookers 'R Us
in London, too.

231
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,486
Oh, and I suppose
you did better.

232
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,188
Oh, wait.
I remember, Jack.

233
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,824
<i>You didn't get</i>
<i>our daughter anything</i>
<i>for Christmas, did you?</i>

234
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,760
I wonder why, Alison.

235
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,129
Are you still banning
the entire holiday, Jack?

236
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,764
Don't you think that's
getting a little immature?

237
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,833
Would you like
to hear something
really immature?

238
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,201
What?

You know, Suzanne,
I was thinking

250
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,749
that since we're in the store
that has literally everything

251
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:09,053
that you might see something
that you really, really want,

252
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,388
and then I could
buy it for you.

253
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,624
[Suzanne]
But, Dad,
this is a drugstore.

254
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,360
Wait, you mean
a Christmas present?

255
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,429
No, see, it's nothing
to do with Christmas.

256
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,999
It's just one of those things
a cool dad does for his daughter
any day of the year.

257
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,100
Yeah.

258
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,102
Go ahead.
Anything you want.
You name it.

259
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,538
Anything except makeup.

260
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,408
Good evening, ladies.

261
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,181
Excuse me.

262
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,850
- Yeah.
- Do you have any other cola?

263
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,051
You need more than
what we got?

264
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,353
Well, I like this brand,
but I want the plain can.

265
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,654
I'm not following ya.

266
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,690
That's Santa Claus.
Don't want him on there, okay?

267
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,292
You got something
against Santa Claus?

268
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:52,363
No, but I just don't support
what he represents,
so... plain cans.

269
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,198
Santa not give you,
like, a train set
when you were a kid?

270
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,766
- That's funny. That's--
- Hey, Dad!

271
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,269
I got this
really great lipstick,
and it's on sale.

272
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,371
I'm sorry, but you have
to put it back because...

273
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,207
we are no longer shopping
in this establishment.

274
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,876
- Why not?
- Because apparently

275
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,212
the employees do not
respect the customer's
holiday beliefs.

276
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,280
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

277
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,249
Sir, I respect
your holiday beliefs.

278
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,816
I just, um, I just think
they're kind of weird.

279
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,086
Oh. Did you
not hear that?

280
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,054
Dad, they are kinda weird!

281
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,890
Honey, do not side
with the help.

00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,094
Merry Ho-Ho!

284
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:32,203
So you just want me
to visit Jack Cameron-- Ah.

285
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:38,042
And-- And tell him that
he's gonna be visited
by three spirits?

286
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,778
- Yeah, that's it.
- What's the point of that?

287
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:45,116
I mean, why not just you guys
show up instead of me--

288
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,751
Well, it makes
the transition easier.

289
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,955
Seeing someone that you know
just smoothes the way.

290
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,057
I always thought you guys
were just fictional characters

291
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,659
that Charles Dickens
made up in that, uh--

292
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,561
Charles Dickens
was a two-bit hack!

293
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,830
Hey, don't get him started.

294
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,900
Charles Dickens was
a former target of ours

295
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,669
who chose to write a book
about his experiences,

296
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,240
even though we explicitly
told him not to.

297
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,108
But it was a great book.

298
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,711
It was crap!
Like everything he did!

299
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,680
Did you ever read
<i>A Tale of Two Cities?</i>

300
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,916
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times."

301
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,018
Make up your mind,
Mr. Dickens!

302
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,088
Okay, okay, okay.
But why me, huh? I mean--

303
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:27,758
Well, in a roundabout way,
you died as a result
of working too much.

304
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:31,295
And for our cause,
that is...

305
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,098
incredibly effective.

306
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,134
You're the only one
that can do this,
Mr. Preston.

307
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,735
Will you help us?

308
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,638
Will you help
your friend Jack?

309
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,227
Oh, where are we off to?

310
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,030
- Out.
- Out where?

311
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,832
- A party.
- A Christmas Eve party?

312
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,403
Yes, Dad,
a Christmas Eve party.

313
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,571
A Christmas Eve party.

314
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,740
Well, have fun.
I'm gonna sit right here

315
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,610
and give this night
the respect it deserves.

316
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,845
By getting drunk
and watching TV?

317
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,015
And eating frozen burritos.

318
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,716
But, Suzanne, go ahead.

319
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,684
Celebrate the worst day
of our lives.

320
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,557
Dad, we have two options
for focusing our attention
today.

321
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:39,430
One is presents, cheer, elves,
candy canes and sugarplums.

322
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,901
The other is an event which
took place seven years ago
that did indeed suck.

323
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,003
But it was seven years ago.

324
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,105
Honey, maybe one day
you'll grow up

325
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,075
and then you'll understand
what this day symbolizes.

326
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:55,379
And maybe one day you'll realize
that there's more to life
than dwelling in the past.

327
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:58,282
Really? Like what?

328
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,217
I'm gonna let you
figure that out.

329
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:01,618
Okay.

330
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,588
Now, I'm going
to this party,

331
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:07,458
and you should
consider yourself lucky
if I come back at all.

332
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,527
Oh, really?
Well, I'll tell you what.

333
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:13,297
You should consider yourself
lucky if I'm-- if I, uh--

334
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,731
[door slams]

335
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,235
Be home at midnight!
I'll have something witty
to say then.

336
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,304
Oh, if I... if I, um...

337
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:26,210
I got nothing.
I got nothing.

338
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,155
[sighs]

339
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,267
What, are you crying?

340
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,806
Are you kidding?
It's been, like, seven years.

341
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,875
Funny, I was expecting you
to be a little more shocked.

342
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,011
It's been
a really long day.

343
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:06,617
What happened to you, Jack?
Huh? I mean, you look bad.

344
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,052
- [Matthew chuckles]
- Uh, I look bad?

345
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,988
What happened to you?
The Matthew I knew

346
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,090
wouldn't have been
caught dead in that shirt.

347
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,891
Oh, wait. Too late.

348
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,261
Very funny. You know,
I could sit here all evening

349
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,096
and exchange witty banter
with you, Jack,

350
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,465
but I'm actually here
to tell you about your
plans for this evening.

351
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,967
Well, my plans are to stay in
and take it easy.

352
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,370
Oh, there's gonna be
a lot more than that
happening.

353
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,071
You're gonna be visited
by three spirits.

354
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,773
Is that three spirits
counting you,

355
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,209
or three in addition to you,
'cause that would be four.

356
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,644
Uh, in addition.

357
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:34,911
Okay, well,
that's four spirits,

358
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,580
and I wish you'd have
said that right up top.

359
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,949
Are they all gonna be
dead former coworkers?

360
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:42,319
No. They're gonna be
the Ghosts of Christmas.

361
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:43,320
Like in the book!

362
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,088
Yeah, like in the book.

363
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,791
But do yourself a favor.
Don't even mention the book
to these guys

364
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,127
because it's kind of like
a sore subject.

365
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,729
That would make me...
Scrooge,

366
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,798
and you would be like
that Bob Marley guy.

367
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,467
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

368
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,002
- Something like that.
- Ah.

369
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,806
Doesn't any of this shock
or concern you at all?

370
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,809
You know, it would
if I didn't know that
it was a hallucination

371
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,745
brought on by the combination
of alcohol and stress.

372
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,981
All right, well,
don't say I didn't
warn you.

373
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,517
Okay, one's gonna
be here at 8:00.

374
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:16,620
And then there's gonna be
another one at, uh...

375
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,255
What is that? At 9:00.

376
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,357
Oh, and then the third one
comes at 10:00.

377
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,926
And that's the Ghost of
Christmas Future, am I right?

378
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,094
Yes, yes.

379
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,862
But you know what?
I gotta get going.

380
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,899
And, Jack, Merry Christmas.

381
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,204
Oh...

382
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,539
That ain't right.

383
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,341
[sighs]

384
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,816
[screams]

385
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:04,651
How'd you get in here?

386
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,853
Were you not listening
to the dead-fish guy?

387
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:08,722
It was only an hour ago,
for crying out loud.

388
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,490
Who are you?

389
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,125
Are you gonna hit me
with that lamp?

390
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:13,760
Are you gonna
lamp me to death?

391
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:14,828
Who are you?

392
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:17,397
Well, who do you think I am?

393
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:21,267
I'm the Ghost
of Christmas Past!

394
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:23,203
You mean, that was--

395
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:24,671
That's right.

396
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,541
No. No, no, no, no.

397
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:29,309
No, you're a hallucination

398
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:32,912
brought on by a combination
of alcohol and stress.

399
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,048
Try this
for a hallucination.

400
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,553
All right!
Let's get going.

401
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:41,788
- Ouch.
- Chop chop!

402
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:43,824
We've got places to be.

403
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:45,024
Mustn't dawdle.

404
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,297
Whoa, whoa, what are you
gonna do with that?

405
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:54,267
This.

406
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,971
[beeping]

407
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,309
Snow?

408
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:05,211
Get up!

409
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:09,883
Hey.

410
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:12,151
That looks just like
the house I grew up in
in St. Canard, Illinois.

411
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,421
You're kidding!

412
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,089
Except it can't be 'cause
they tore it down years ago.

413
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:20,394
Ha! That's why the call me
the Ghost of Christmas Past.

414
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:23,162
It's December 24th, 1965.

415
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:27,634
And inside that house is you
as a young child, sleeping.

416
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,035
Why me?
In the book,

417
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:30,837
Ebenezer Scrooge
is a mean old man
who hates Christmas.

418
00:21:30,906 --> 00:21:31,872
I, I just--

419
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,939
Ding ding ding!

420
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:34,508
Congratulations,
contestant!

421
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:37,477
Let's see what's behind
door number two, shall we?

422
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,614
Wait a minute.
I'm not just some
mean old man, okay?

423
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:42,348
I hate Christmas
for a reason.

424
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:44,418
Something very bad
happened to me,

425
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:46,352
and no amount of
memories you show me
is gonna change that.

426
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:48,988
Zip it! Zip, zip, zip!

427
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:54,227
You know, Jack,
I could honestly
not care less about you.

428
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:56,863
Your messed up,
whiny little life,

429
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:59,933
your inability
to function in society,

430
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:01,768
your relationship
with your daughter,

431
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:05,238
which any psychologist
would call disastrous.

432
00:22:05,307 --> 00:22:06,339
All I really want

433
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,774
is to get your butt
in that house

434
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:10,444
so we can do our thing,
and I can go.

435
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:13,447
Okay, so long as
we're on the same page.

436
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:22,288
Ta-da!

437
00:22:22,357 --> 00:22:24,390
Hey!
Can they hear me?

438
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,225
Yes, Jack,
they can hear you.

439
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:27,461
That's why I brought you
back in time,

440
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:29,529
so we can all sit around
the fire, chew the fat.

441
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,499
Talk over old times.
Change the course of history!

442
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:34,300
Yeah, why don't you
trot over there and,

443
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:37,337
and tell 'em who won
the 1968 World Series.

444
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:39,973
Dad! Bet on
the St. Louis Cardinals.

445
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,742
Listen, I'm not gonna
let your attitude problem
ruin this for me, okay?

446
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:44,077
Attitude problem?

447
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:46,079
You have a hissy fit
every time you hear
"Jingle Bells,"

448
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:48,748
and I've got
an attitude problem?

449
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,660
Where are they going?

450
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:02,829
Jack, it's Christmas Eve.

451
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:06,633
They just stacked the trees
with gifts for their kid.
That would be you.

452
00:23:06,702 --> 00:23:09,836
And now they're going off
to bed to have nightmares
about all that money they spent

453
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:12,572
trying to put a smile
on your sweet little face.

454
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,875
You're kidding me, right?
You brought me all the way here

455
00:23:14,943 --> 00:23:17,511
to try to make me
feel guilty about getting
what I wanted for Christmas

456
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:18,912
when I was a kid?

457
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,648
No, Jack, that is not
why I brought you here.

458
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:28,087
[sighs]

459
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,188
Do you--

460
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:32,592
Do you have any idea...

461
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,629
how much better
things used to be?

462
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:36,830
I do.

463
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:39,098
I witnessed it
firsthand.

464
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,667
Christmas
used to have meaning.

465
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:43,469
It was more than just
a time for the family
together at the mall.

466
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:47,473
People were kind to one another
for no apparent reason.

467
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:49,876
And even if it was
just for one day,

468
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:53,146
people really seemed
to care about those
that were less fortunate.

469
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:55,615
Every year, Jack.

470
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:59,719
My job becomes
more and more pointless.

471
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:02,155
People get more
and more cynical.

472
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:05,559
We used to have to use
the spiritual guilt trip
once every two years

473
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:07,427
for some poor lost soul.

474
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:11,230
And now the poor lost souls
are outnumbering
the regular people.

475
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,233
And yes, Jack,
I have an attitude problem.

476
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:15,401
Oh, Jack!

477
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,204
My attitude stinks!

478
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,142
I'm fighting a war
that I cannot win.

479
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,813
And being a soldier
no longer seems worth it.

480
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:34,955
Did you forget
to take your meds?

481
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:37,090
Huh?

482
00:24:37,158 --> 00:24:39,325
Is there somebody
I could call?

483
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,660
Come on, buddy.

484
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,861
Come on, get it together.
Come on, now.

485
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,363
Show me your magic,
and let me go home.

486
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:46,399
Show me some magic,
brother.

487
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:50,303
[laughing]

488
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:52,606
Yes! There we go.

489
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:53,840
Mwah! Ha ha!

490
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,908
Goodbye!

491
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:59,545
[laughing]

492
00:24:59,615 --> 00:25:01,347
What'd you do?

493
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,084
I hope you like 1965

494
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:07,153
'cause I, personally,
I'm very fond of it.

495
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,023
What are you
talking about?

496
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,492
- Look out the window!
- Okay.

497
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,593
[laughing]

498
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:16,863
What am I looking for?

499
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,413
Aww.

500
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,817
Hmm.

501
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,353
It's show time.

502
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,690
I hope he's not
in his underwear.

503
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,628
Hmm.

504
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,767
Hello?

505
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,641
What the hell
happened here?

506
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,784
[dialing]

507
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:30,419
[ringing]

508
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:33,322
<i>Hello, you've reached</i>
<i>the Ghost of Christmas Past.</i>

509
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:34,457
<i>- I can't come to the--</i>
- [beeps]

510
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,296
Well, this is unusual.

511
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,102
[all arguing]

512
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,637
What do you mean,
he never came back?

513
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:51,174
I waited at the house
for almost half an hour.
They never showed.

514
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,945
Past is only allotted one hour
to show the target around.

515
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,548
He knows that.
He's done it 2,000 times.

516
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,018
- Oh no.
- What "Oh, no"?

517
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,419
Past's spectral snowflake
has been broken.

518
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,288
Broken? But that means--

519
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:08,491
He and the target are now
living, breathing humans
in whatever year they're in.

520
00:27:09,645 --> 00:27:10,776
1965?

521
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:14,046
Oh, this isn't good.
This isn't good at all.

522
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:18,151
Okay. Well,
we don't have to worry.

523
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,421
Now he can use his
candy cane chronometer,
and he'll come back.

524
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,855
Right?

525
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:27,093
- Trevor?
- Unless he doesn't want to.

526
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:29,629
- Why wouldn't he want to?
- Well, you tell me.

527
00:27:29,697 --> 00:27:32,365
You're the one who said
he's been acting over-distant.

528
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:34,400
If he doesn't get back,
there's gonna be trouble.

529
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:36,336
- What kind of trouble?
- Big trouble.

530
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,939
Our powers wear off
less than three hours from now.

531
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:41,807
If the target hasn't been
returned to the present by then,

532
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:44,043
then he'll be stuck
in the past, forever.

533
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:46,346
- That is trouble.
- More than you know.

534
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,081
Oh, if the head office
finds out we lost a target,

535
00:27:49,151 --> 00:27:51,518
they'll shut down
the entire program.

536
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,619
Do you know
what that means?

537
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:54,854
- Yeah, we will be unemployed.
- Worse.

538
00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:57,023
Time is a balance.

539
00:27:57,091 --> 00:28:00,026
If Jack doesn't get back
to his own Christmas
by midnight tonight,

540
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:02,262
then that balance
will be upset.

541
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,715
Every Christmas he ever had
will cease to exist.

542
00:28:05,783 --> 00:28:08,818
He will cease to exist.

543
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,571
The domino effect
could be catastrophic.

544
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,641
The future could change.
The world could be upended.

545
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,011
The entire universe
as we know it could implode!

546
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,245
There'll be chaos!

547
00:28:19,314 --> 00:28:21,147
Th-There will be hysteria!

548
00:28:21,216 --> 00:28:22,883
Oh, the humanity!

549
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:23,950
Ow.

550
00:28:26,655 --> 00:28:28,021
We have to stop thinking
about the future

551
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:30,089
and start thinking
about the present.

552
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:32,025
We need to know
what's going on in the past.

553
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:34,427
How?

554
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,532
Send me back.

555
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,633
What?

556
00:28:41,003 --> 00:28:43,036
Yes. Send me back.

557
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:45,238
No, no, it's too dangerous.

558
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,806
What, more dangerous
than the end of everything?

559
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:50,043
Maybe I should send Future.

560
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:54,213
No, nobody knows where he is.
Besides, we don't have
enough time.

561
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:56,650
It's gotta be me, Trevor.

562
00:28:57,786 --> 00:29:01,154
All right.
It's up to you, then.

563
00:29:04,726 --> 00:29:08,294
The life of Jack Cameron
and the Christmas Eve Program
are at stake.

564
00:29:08,363 --> 00:29:10,864
Not to mention
the entire universe.

565
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:16,736
I've always wanted
to see the past.

566
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:20,373
Oh, one more thing.
I need to see your spectral.

567
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:21,507
Okay.

568
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:24,811
What did you do that for?

569
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,680
Past is human now.

570
00:29:26,748 --> 00:29:30,083
So in order to catch him,
you'll have to be human, too.

571
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:32,318
Good luck, Present.

572
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:34,904
And if I don't see you again,

573
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,923
Happy Holidays.

574
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,731
[sighs]

575
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,472
What is going on?

576
00:30:06,654 --> 00:30:08,388
Whoa.

577
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:19,432
It's me.

578
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,001
Why are you tied up?

579
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,869
You can see me?

580
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:25,638
Who are you?

581
00:30:25,706 --> 00:30:29,142
I don't even know where
to begin to answer that.

582
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,843
Are you Santa Claus?

583
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,211
Huh?

584
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,948
Why are you tied up,
Santa Claus?

585
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:37,783
- I'm not Santa Claus.
- Are you one of his helpers?

586
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:42,021
My mom told me the man
at the department store
is one of his helpers.

587
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,823
Are you one of his helpers?

588
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:46,125
Yeah, I'm one of his helpers.

589
00:30:46,194 --> 00:30:47,994
Why are you tied up?

590
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:50,229
You should go back to bed.

591
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:52,498
Did Santa tie you up?

592
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:54,500
Yeah, Santa tied me up.

593
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:55,701
Why?

594
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,704
Because I ate some of
his milk and cookies.

595
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,873
I asked Mom if we could leave
some milk and cookies,

596
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,076
and she said Santa
was already too fat.

597
00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:06,946
She used to say
stuff like that a lot.

598
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:08,647
That's why
I have food issues.

599
00:31:08,716 --> 00:31:09,782
[floorboards creak]

600
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:11,184
- Who's that?
- Oh, I think I know.

601
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:13,353
- Untie me.
- I don't know, mister.

602
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:14,553
I'll make you waffles.

603
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,089
I know you love waffles
with powdered sugar.

604
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:17,357
Come on, untie me.

605
00:31:19,594 --> 00:31:22,495
Okay, yeah, looking good.

606
00:31:22,563 --> 00:31:25,164
I got this. Okay, son,
go hide, hide, hide, hide.

607
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:26,699
Go hide, hide.

608
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,040
- Urrgh!
- Aah!

609
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:48,287
[Young Jack]
Who are you?

610
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:49,588
Oh.

611
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,090
This isn't good.

612
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,725
Are you Santa Claus?

613
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:54,527
No.

614
00:31:54,595 --> 00:31:57,897
I'm, uh, the Tooth Fairy.

615
00:31:57,965 --> 00:31:59,732
So why don't you
just go off to bed?

616
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,567
I wanna open my presents.

617
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,069
Yeah, it would
be best if you--

618
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:04,737
But I wanna open them now!

619
00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:07,373
Go to bed now,
or I will come back tomorrow

620
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:11,310
and rip out all of your teeth
with a pair of pliers.

621
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:17,283
Oh, great. Now I'm
emotionally scarred for life.

622
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,353
Which reminds me.
Hey! Stay the heck away
from Old Man Williams!

623
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:22,255
Hey, just let it go.

624
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,426
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, strange lady.

625
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:28,461
- Now, who are you again?
- Oh.

626
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,329
I'm the Ghost
of Christmas Present.

627
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:33,232
Then, uh, how come
you're in my past?

628
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:35,234
Well, we've had
a little situation.

629
00:32:35,303 --> 00:32:38,504
But don't you worry
'cause I'm here
to fix things.

630
00:32:39,907 --> 00:32:40,973
Oh, no.

631
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,776
Oh, no, oh, no!

632
00:32:43,844 --> 00:32:44,877
What?

633
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:46,412
It's broken!

634
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:47,513
What is?

635
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:49,415
Our ride home!

636
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:50,649
That's a candy cane!

637
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,918
It's Christmas Eve.
We'll go get another one.

638
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:54,954
Jack, this isn't just
any candy cane.

639
00:32:55,022 --> 00:32:59,141
This is a highly sensitive piece
of technologically advanced
time-travel equipment!

640
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,577
Oh!

641
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,978
Wow.

642
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,446
You shouldn't have sat on it.

643
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,114
I didn't sit on it.

644
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,083
Somebody tackled me!

645
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,651
Because I thought
you were the little dude!

646
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,421
Oh, do I look like
the little dude?

647
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,522
No.

648
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,357
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

649
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,694
[sighs]

650
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,562
So we're stuck here.

651
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:22,999
Yes, Jack,
we are stuck here.

652
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:27,670
I mean, the only way
to get you back
to your own time is...

653
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,705
Past.

654
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:29,806
So we missed it.

655
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,040
What?

656
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,376
You said our time had passed.

657
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:34,977
No, not passed. Past.

658
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,046
- Past.
- Right!

659
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,049
So we missed it.

660
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,285
- Just follow me.
- [Jack laughs]

661
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:46,790
The Ghost of Christmas Past
still has his candy cane
chronometer.

662
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,958
We need to find him.

663
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,393
And we need wheels.

664
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,762
Don't do that, please.

665
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:56,499
See, it's 1965,
and nobody locks their cars.

666
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,401
- Really.
- Mm-hmm.

667
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,437
All right, I will just
hot-wire this--

668
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:05,374
No, no, no, no.
In 1965, everybody
put their keys right here.

669
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,977
- Really.
- Yeah.

670
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,979
No seatbelts
'cause it's, uh...

671
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,348
- 1965?
- Yeah!

672
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,083
- Get in.

Okay, so basically
what you're telling me is,

683
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,781
if we don't find
this guy by midnight,

684
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,616
I am stuck here forever.

685
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:48,618
- Yeah, pretty much, yeah.
- Yeah.

686
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,687
Don't you guys have
like a contingency plan

687
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,556
or escape route that we
could be taking right now?

688
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:55,157
Yes, and I'm it.

689
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,861
Okay, now, think, Jack.
What exactly happened?

690
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,562
What exactly
did he say?

691
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:03,099
Well, we were in
my parents' living room,
and he started weeping.

692
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:07,236
He started weeping and
getting weird and maudlin
and self-pitying.

693
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,739
Reminded me of
my crazy Aunt Shirley
when she got drunk.

694
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:14,477
Then all of a sudden,
he pulls out this
giant snowflake thing,

695
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,580
and he smashes it
on the fireplace.

696
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,248
So he did this
on purpose.

697
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,917
He did that on purpose,
for sure.

698
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:22,519
But why?

699
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,353
- Wha-- You tell me!
- Where could he have gone?

700
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,955
What do you mean?
You know everything, right?

701
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:28,124
No, I know everything
about the present.

702
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,226
- Right, and this is the past.
- Yes!

703
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,461
I get it.
I'm getting this thing.

704
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:35,097
- Slowly.
- Yes.

705
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,568
What is the first thing
that Past would do
as a human?

706
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,603
Probably
something strange.

707
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,905
[gasps]

708
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,007
Where's the closest place
we can go to buy cigarettes?

709
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,410
Well, it's Christmas Eve,
so everything is closed.

710
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,045
Except...

711
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,088
- He's here.
- Yeah.

712
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,658
- I can feel it.
- I can feel it, too.

713
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:02,792
Oh!

714
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,162
Look at these toys!

715
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,031
- Oh, that's cool.
- They're so simple,

716
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,299
yet the children seem to
love them, don't you, honey?

717
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,769
Because they have to use
their imaginations.
It's fun, right?

718
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,170
- It's fun!
- [toot]

719
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,373
I'm sorry. It's fun.
See how funny that is?

720
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:18,575
Look at this!

721
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,577
What, they're advertising
guns to children?

722
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,679
Oh, no! They're BB guns.
They're only BB guns.

723
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,447
These fire
real metal pellets?

724
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,382
Real, little, tiny,
tiny metal pellets.

725
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:29,351
Oh, this is ridiculous.
You just put this thing down.

726
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,120
You could put
somebody's eye out
with one of these things.

727
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,824
Step away from the guns!
Where's the manager?

728
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:37,293
I demand to speak
with the manager!

729
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,562
Cigarettes are on
the third floor.
I just remembered.

730
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,298
Let's go, let's go!
Here, son.

731
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,933
[Present]
Santa, keep the kids
away from the guns!

732
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,234
[Jack]
Yeah, Santa!

733
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:47,003
Now, these are,
in my opinion,

734
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,204
the closest to Cuban
you'll find.

735
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,672
Word has it,
President Kennedy himself

736
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,540
sent a box to Castro

737
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,910
just to show him
how we do things here
in the U.S. of A.

738
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:55,712
- Excuse me.
- One moment, little lady.

739
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,314
- Excuse me.
- I said one moment.

740
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,515
I suggest you put the reins
on your wife, pal.

741
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,051
Okay, I got a couple
of questions for you.

742
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,020
Now, I have a friend.
How tall is he?

743
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,121
He's about like that.

744
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,656
Yeah, with a green vest
and a red tie.

745
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,157
What's his name?

746
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,325
Christmas Past.

747
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,128
Chris Maspast.
Chris, first name--

748
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,830
Yeah, he walked off
about three minutes ago.

749
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,531
Yeah, where'd he go?

750
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,666
He asked me where
the hat department was,

751
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,267
and I told him it was
on the second floor.

752
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,869
Thank you so much.

753
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,038
You're... welcome.

Past, what are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

770
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:27,403
Why couldn't you
just leave me be?

771
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,338
Just give us
the candy cane chronometer.

772
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,774
We'll go back to the office
and sort this out.

773
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,109
You know, I was really
looking forward to the '60s.

774
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:35,794
It was a great decade.

775
00:38:35,863 --> 00:38:37,430
You know,
you leave me no choice.

776
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:39,165

You came, too?

779
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,611

we're all connected to yours.

00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,745
Oh, well...

781
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:57,783

I missed you.

800
00:39:46,734 --> 00:39:47,967
- Hi.
- I lost him.

801
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:49,168
Oh.

802
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:52,437
I gotta ask you a question.

803
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:55,607
How did we get
where we are right now?

804
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:57,776
Well, Past time-jumped,
and we're connected
with him,

805
00:39:57,845 --> 00:39:59,945
so that means we're now
somewhere else in time.

806
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:01,780
Okay, we're somewhere
in time.

807
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:03,849
Can you be that
much more specific?

808
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:06,318
Well, we can only travel
to a Christmas Eve
in your past,

809
00:40:06,387 --> 00:40:09,355
so that means that
you are somewhere nearby.

810
00:40:09,423 --> 00:40:11,223
Okay, but when you say,
"You are nearby,"

811
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:13,058
- you don't mean this you.
- No, young you.

812
00:40:13,127 --> 00:40:15,527
"Young you" is nearby.
[sighs]

813
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:16,795
Okay.

814
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:20,299
Now, do we--
do we hide here and--

815
00:40:20,368 --> 00:40:21,300
Oh, come here!

816
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:23,302
Young me.

817
00:40:23,371 --> 00:40:25,037
That's you?

818
00:40:29,576 --> 00:40:31,410
What have you done now?

819
00:40:31,478 --> 00:40:32,677
My ski broke off.

820
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:36,315
So where and when are we?

821
00:40:36,384 --> 00:40:40,585
Okay, Aspen, Colorado,
Christmas Eve 1978,

822
00:40:40,654 --> 00:40:42,955
the Ski Valley Lodge,

823
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,590
and this is my honeymoon.

824
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:49,428
Did, uh, did the ski
break up with you,

825
00:40:49,496 --> 00:40:51,530
or did you break up
with the ski?

826
00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:53,498
- I broke up with it.
- [laughs]

827
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:55,801
I caught it slipping around
with the luge.

828
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:57,436
Behind my back!

829
00:40:57,504 --> 00:41:01,540
Well, don't worry.
There's a million skis
in the sea.

830
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:05,144
What, jealous?

831
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,946
It's okay, we're married.

832
00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:08,547
[laughing]

833
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,885
You know, after this,
I think they go into
the game room

834
00:41:13,955 --> 00:41:16,989
and make sweet love
on the pool table.

835
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,325
Too much information.

836
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,360
We have less than two hours.

837
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:24,063
- Okay.
- Let's go.

838
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:26,298
Sucker.

839
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,619
What are they wearing?

840
00:41:47,688 --> 00:41:49,855
I like it. Back then,
people dressed kind of--

841
00:41:49,923 --> 00:41:51,290
- Cheesy?
- Huh.

842
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,458
Are you folks
checking in?

843
00:41:52,526 --> 00:41:53,925
- Yes.
- No.

844
00:41:53,995 --> 00:41:55,527
We're browsing.

845
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,729
Well, you might
as well make yourselves
comfortable.

846
00:41:57,798 --> 00:41:59,198
The snowstorm
has closed all
the roads down.

847
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,900
Nobody is coming
or going anywhere
until tomorrow.

848
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:04,003
That's right, that's right.
I remember.

849
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:05,971
The whole lodge
is snowed in.

850
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,573
No one gets in or out,
and there's no place else
to stay for miles.

851
00:42:08,642 --> 00:42:11,377
Okay, so if Past is here,
he is here.

852
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,212
Okay, so we need to
find you a hiding spot.

853
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,014
- Yes.
- Because the last thing
we need

854
00:42:15,082 --> 00:42:16,815
is you sneezing
on the younger version
of yourself,

855
00:42:16,884 --> 00:42:18,417
and when you get back
to the present,

856
00:42:18,486 --> 00:42:20,652
you'll find
the world is ruled
by giant talking apes.

857
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:24,089
Yeah, right,
like that can happen.

858

00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,360
Good.

1034
00:52:29,429 --> 00:52:32,130
I didn't have a choice.

1035
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:37,535
So... what are we
gonna do till midnight?

1036
00:52:39,172 --> 00:52:41,006
[coughing]

1037
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:42,373
Good stuff.

1038
00:52:42,442 --> 00:52:43,942
This is disgusting.

1039
00:52:44,011 --> 00:52:45,110
Yeah, yep.

1040
00:52:45,178 --> 00:52:46,511
And it turns out
in the future

1041
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,715
we find that they're
actually bad for you, too.

1042
00:52:49,783 --> 00:52:51,549
What about this?

1043
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:54,486
Oh, that's fine,
drink up.

1044
00:52:54,554 --> 00:52:56,888
So you can't
remember anything?

1045
00:52:56,957 --> 00:53:00,959
Well, I mean,
I can remember basic skills
and functions and whatnot.

1046
00:53:01,028 --> 00:53:02,928
You know, I remember
how to tie my shoes,

1047
00:53:02,997 --> 00:53:05,497
and use a computer, and...

1048
00:53:05,565 --> 00:53:08,700
I am surprisingly good
at kung fu. It's just...

1049
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:12,671
I don't really have a sense
of life in the past.

1050
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,139
Why did they
do that to you?

1051
00:53:14,207 --> 00:53:15,206
I don't know.

1052
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,875
I guess the head office
didn't want

1053
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,877
any one of the Ghosts
having too much power.

1054
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:21,079
You know, so we can all
only remember the past,

1055
00:53:21,148 --> 00:53:23,381
the present,
or the future.

1056
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,118
Well, the past
is overrated, believe me.

1057
00:53:26,186 --> 00:53:27,519
But you know
the present, right?

1058
00:53:27,587 --> 00:53:29,821
Pretty much, I mean,
the present being today.

1059
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:31,823
- Mm-hmm.
You know everything?
- Yes.

1060
00:53:31,892 --> 00:53:33,625
I can ask you anything,
and you could answer.

1061
00:53:33,694 --> 00:53:35,060
- Sure.
- Where's Madonna?

1062
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,161
In her bathroom.

1063
00:53:36,229 --> 00:53:37,162
Where's
my wedding ring?

1064
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:38,263
In the bottom
of your sock drawer.

1065
00:53:38,331 --> 00:53:39,264
Where's my daughter?

1066
00:53:39,332 --> 00:53:40,666
She's making out
with Chip Wattingham

1067
00:53:40,734 --> 00:53:42,167
in the front seat
of his car.

1068
00:53:42,235 --> 00:53:44,069
I'm kidding.
[chuckles]

1069
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:46,171
She's in the back seat.

1070
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,407
You're pretty funny
for a dead chick.

1071
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:50,942
Yeah? You're pretty handsome.

1072
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:51,943
What?

1073
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:54,046
What?

1074
00:53:54,114 --> 00:53:55,513
What'd you say?

1075
00:53:55,582 --> 00:53:57,115
You know,
I think it's getting
kind of busy in here.

1076
00:53:57,184 --> 00:53:58,349
We probably should get going.

1077
00:53:58,418 --> 00:53:59,384
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1078
00:53:59,452 --> 00:54:00,919
Because of the giant
talking apes?

1079
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,587
Yes, and we don't want you
bumping into yourself.

1080
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,423
If I bump into myself,
that could change
everything and--

1081
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,225
- Exactly.
- What was it you said
a minute ago?

1082
00:54:07,294 --> 00:54:08,660
- I think we should go.
- Really?

1083
00:54:08,729 --> 00:54:10,896
- Yeah.
- All right.

1084
00:54:15,202 --> 00:54:17,435
Hey, thanks a lot!

1085
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,171
Merry Christmas!

1086
00:54:20,607 --> 00:54:22,007
Hey, hey, man!

1087
00:54:22,076 --> 00:54:24,042
What the hell is this?

1088
00:54:24,111 --> 00:54:26,444
[Jack]
All right, okay.

1089
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:30,215
[Present]
We need a place to hide
until Past comes back.

1090
00:54:30,283 --> 00:54:33,351
We'll find a place. Oh!

1091
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,953
This looks good.
How about here?

1092
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:37,622
- What?
- Come on in here.

1093
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,759
Hey, buddy!
You were headed for 2...

1094
00:54:40,828 --> 00:54:42,127
- 215?
- Exactly.

1095
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:45,430
I'm not there anymore.
I'm down here, so hold this.

1096
00:54:45,498 --> 00:54:47,232
Hold this.

1097
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,234
Thank you. Make sure
nobody bothers us, okay?

1098
00:54:49,302 --> 00:54:52,604
- Yeah.
- Enjoy, enjoy.

1099
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,108
What are we doing in here?

1100
00:54:56,176 --> 00:54:58,176
Well, you said to find
a good place to hide,

1101
00:54:58,245 --> 00:55:00,578
and I'd say this is
a great place to hide.

1102
00:55:00,647 --> 00:55:02,781
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, I don't think so.

1103
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:05,884
Listen,
we still have time.

1104
00:55:05,953 --> 00:55:08,720
Why should Past
have all the fun?

1105
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:18,864
Are you okay...

1106
00:55:18,932 --> 00:55:20,132
Present?

1107
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:24,870
Yes. This is great.

1108
00:55:24,938 --> 00:55:27,438
This was a great idea.

1109
00:55:27,507 --> 00:55:30,108
Thanks.

1110
00:55:30,177 --> 00:55:34,813
You know, I can kind
of understand why Past
wanted to be human again.

1111
00:55:34,882 --> 00:55:37,348
Is he gonna be in trouble
when we go back?

1112
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,684
Oh, yeah.

1113
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,719
Are you gonna be
in trouble?

1114
00:55:41,789 --> 00:55:43,354
Oh, yeah.

1115
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,391
Well, I'm not gonna
allow that to happen.

1116
00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:48,894
I'm gonna tell 'em
that you did everything
humanly possible

1117
00:55:48,962 --> 00:55:50,862
to get his little butt
back there,

1118
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,597
and you'll be okay,
trust me.

1119
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:02,740
You're an interesting guy,
Jack.

1120
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:04,943
Thanks.

1121
00:56:05,012 --> 00:56:06,577
You are--

1122
00:56:06,646 --> 00:56:08,246
What's the word?

1123
00:56:09,649 --> 00:56:11,016
Perfect.

1124
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,723
So, um, what happened
with your wife?

1125
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,158
She tricked me.

1126
00:56:20,227 --> 00:56:23,728
I thought we had
a happy marriage...

1127
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,364
for almost 20 years.

1128
00:56:26,433 --> 00:56:30,001
And then one day, bam.

1129
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:33,038
You had no idea?
No warning sign?

1130
00:56:33,106 --> 00:56:34,105
No.

1131
00:56:34,174 --> 00:56:37,775
I mean, we had
the usual disagreements.

1132
00:56:37,845 --> 00:56:41,279
I worked too much.
I didn't spend
enough time with her.

1133
00:56:41,348 --> 00:56:42,714
She'd get really upset.

1134
00:56:42,782 --> 00:56:45,884
But then a few days later,
suddenly she'd get over it.

1135
00:56:45,953 --> 00:56:50,989
Now I know what she was
getting to get over it.

1136
00:56:51,058 --> 00:56:54,692
And the worst part
is the way she did it.

1137
00:56:54,761 --> 00:56:59,030
During my daughter's
Christmas recital.

1138
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:02,400
She got up,
walked out the door,

1139
00:57:02,469 --> 00:57:04,402
hopped on that dentist,

1140
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:08,206
and took off
out of our lives.

1141
00:57:08,275 --> 00:57:11,343
He wasn't
even a good dentist.

1142
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:13,912
I mean, if he had
been an astronaut,
I'd understand,

1143
00:57:13,981 --> 00:57:16,848
but...
it's not right.

1144
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,152
How did your daughter
handle it?

1145
00:57:21,221 --> 00:57:24,055
Well, obviously
better than me.

1146
00:57:24,124 --> 00:57:26,258
She's a strong kid.

1147
00:57:28,996 --> 00:57:33,664
I guess the thing...
that hurts me is

1148
00:57:33,733 --> 00:57:36,768
that I wasted
so many years of my life

1149
00:57:36,836 --> 00:57:40,005
on somebody that
obviously did not love me.

1150
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:43,641
That's not what it said
in the report.

1151
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,643
What report?

1152
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,280
The one on you.

1153
00:57:48,348 --> 00:57:51,649
According to our records,
you had a better than average
marriage.

1154
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:55,787
And it produced a daughter
that you love very much.

1155
00:57:55,855 --> 00:58:00,491
So you must've enjoyed those
18 years at least a little bit
while it was happening.

1156
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,627
There were moments.

1157
00:58:02,695 --> 00:58:07,999
Maybe she was doing the best
that she could do at the time.

1158
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:11,569
So why not
let the good memories
outshine the bad memories?

1159
00:58:13,473 --> 00:58:15,373
You don't have
memories, do ya?

1160
00:58:16,676 --> 00:58:19,277
No, and that's what I mean.

1161
00:58:19,346 --> 00:58:22,914
Don't blow it, Jack.

1162
00:58:22,983 --> 00:58:24,882
You know, I thought that
what we did was magic,

1163
00:58:24,952 --> 00:58:29,254
but this-- oh, my gosh--
this is the magic.

1164
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,425
I mean, you still
have a chance.

1165
00:58:33,493 --> 00:58:35,427
Some of us don't.

1166
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:40,065
Are you unhappy?

1167
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:45,536
At this moment in time,
I am very happy.

1168
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:48,974
That makes me
very happy, too.

1169
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:58,016
To hot tubs
and time travel.

1170
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,327
Whoa.

1171
00:59:09,396 --> 00:59:10,395
What?

1172
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:12,864
I'm having a weird feeling.

1173
00:59:12,932 --> 00:59:15,000
Describe it.

1174
00:59:15,068 --> 00:59:17,835
I don't know.

1175
00:59:17,904 --> 00:59:19,871
I think I have to
go to the bathroom.

1176
00:59:19,939 --> 00:59:22,240
- You think?
- Well, I don't know, Jack.

1177
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,675
I haven't been a human
in a long time.

1178
00:59:24,744 --> 00:59:26,711
You could've fooled me

1179

really good at it.

1180
00:59:30,017 --> 00:59:31,116

Alison.

1206
01:01:45,918 --> 01:01:48,553
Now, see, that's
a beautiful name.

1207
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:52,857
A beautiful name
for a beautiful girl.

1208
01:01:52,925 --> 01:01:55,193
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1209
01:01:55,262 --> 01:01:57,162
So, um...

1210
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:01,466
Are you here
at the lodge alone?

1211
01:02:01,535 --> 01:02:03,301
Yeah, sure am.

1212
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,439
Hey, do you have a room?

1213
01:02:08,508 --> 01:02:09,607
Sure do.

1214
01:02:12,279 --> 01:02:14,345
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, 433.

1215
01:02:14,414 --> 01:02:15,913
Why don't I go freshen up,

1216
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,848
and I'll meet you there
in 10 minutes.

1217
01:02:17,917 --> 01:02:19,984
Yeah!

my future ex-wife!

Hey! Hey!
Come on, you guys!

1223

You know, I'm a personal
friend of John Travolta.

Pretty stupid, huh?

1236
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,316
No, it was stupid
to leave you on
the dance floor.

1237
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:18,386

what we started.

You're here!

1243
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:43,711
Oh, yeah, but I'm not
too happy about it.

1244
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:45,446
Take us back!

1245
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:46,747
Now!

1246
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:52,720

Thank you, darlin'!
Come on!

1248
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:00,995
Yes!

1249
01:05:09,806 --> 01:05:13,941
Who are you?

1250
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,509
Ebenezer Scrooge,

1251
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,845
I'm the Ghost
of Christmas Present.

1252
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,747
Boo!

1253
01:05:19,816 --> 01:05:24,018
That is completely
unrealistic.

1254
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:26,921
Oh, my head.
What happened?

1255
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,555
Um...

1256
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:32,392
A big guy
hit you really hard.

1257
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,261
Yeah, then what?

1258
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,030
Then you
kicked his butt.

1259
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,966
Oh, I thought so.

1260
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:41,335
And what are we doing--

1261
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:49,010
- Just stay here.
- Okay.

1262
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:59,887
What are you doing?
We have to get back.

1263
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,722
I'm not going back.

1264
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,691
What?

1265
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,892
You heard me.

1266
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,628
I am taking control of my life.

1267
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:10,097
You don't have a life.

1268
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,733
Exactly, because of this job.

1269
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,568
Look, we were handpicked
for our positions.

1270
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:15,970
This is
a worthwhile service.

1271
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:18,172
You having a good time?

1272
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,107
What does that
have to do with anything?

1273
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:21,575
Jumping back in time,

1274
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,078

1275

1276
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,481
So what if I am?

1277
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,616
You, of all people,

1278
01:06:29,686 --> 01:06:33,554
should understand
where I am coming from.

1279
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:36,290
You're the Ghost
who got the worst deal.

1280
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:38,926
You can't even remember
the good times!

1281
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,928
There is no time
like the present.

1282
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,331
That's because you
haven't been enlightened.

1283
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,866
Go with me?

1284
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:48,703
Oh, we could go
hopping through time!

1285
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:51,138
It would be a hoot!

1286
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:54,608
If we're not back
in a half-an-hour,

1287
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,011
Jack Cameron
will cease to exist.

1288
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,913
Oh!

1289
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:02,183
Small price to pay
for our happiness.

1290
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:04,484
Don't you think
we're owed this?

1291
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:11,558
No!

1292
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:12,659
Nooo!

1293
01:07:14,496 --> 01:07:16,663
Cruel world!

1294
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:20,400
You have seen the future,
Ebenezer.

1295
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,237
Oh! That's my daughter!

1296
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:25,740
[Boy]
How can this be future?

1297
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:28,375
How can I be dead?

1298
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:29,910
[Girl]
We all die, Ebenezer.

1299
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:32,646
It is how we live
that makes us who we are.

1300
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,682
Tonight you have seen your past,
your present, and your future.

1301
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:39,987
It is now time for you
to realize what your life means.

1302
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,188
I don't understand!

1303
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:42,857
It is not what
has happened to us

1304
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:45,893
in the past that makes us
who we are, Scrooge,

1305
01:07:45,962 --> 01:07:48,829
neither is it
this hour's situations
in the present.

1306
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,831
It's what's in our hearts.

1307
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,233
Our hearts?

1308
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:54,068
What happens to us
in the past

1309
01:07:54,137 --> 01:07:56,904
should not dictate
to who we are in the future.

1310
01:07:56,973 --> 01:07:58,305
We use our hearts
to go through life

1311
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:00,274
and play the hand
we're dealt

1312
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:05,880
to make the most of the time
we have on this earth.

1313
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,316
Yes!

1314
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:11,819
Yes, it's true!

1315
01:08:11,888 --> 01:08:17,491

the true meaning
of Christmas.

You're gonna miss the end.

1319
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:55,762
Jack,
what are you doing?
Why did you--

1320
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:57,965
Why did you
change your clothes?

1321
01:08:58,034 --> 01:09:01,836
Cheating on your husband while
your daughter's on stage
on Christmas Eve?

talking about?

when you did not go to
the "Deck the Halls" disco

1326
01:09:10,046 --> 01:09:11,979
and did not try
to pick up that guy?

1327
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:14,281
You knew about that?

1328
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,450
Yeah. I also know you're
on your way to the coat check,

1329
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:20,921
where you're gonna hook up
with Dr. Roland, DDS.

1330
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,957
What, are you psychic
or something?

1332

And I'm gonna miss that
about ya.

1333
01:09:29,065 --> 01:09:32,466
Okay, so now you know.
What do you want from me?

1334
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:35,169
I want to thank you.

1335
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:38,605
You want to thank me
for cheating on you.

1336
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,808
No, I want to
thank you for 18 years of
an above-average marriage.

1337
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:45,112
And I want to thank you
for mothering a wonderful,

who, if all goes well,

1339

will grow up to be
absolutely nothing like you.

for leaving me right now

a few years left

1342

01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,516
We have to get
out of here!

1381
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:05,019
It doesn't matter
what time we're stuck in
or what place,

1382
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,720
as long as we're
stuck in it together.

1383
01:12:06,788 --> 01:12:09,456
Oh, that is
the sweetest thing that
anyone has ever said to me,

1384
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,125
but no, I have to do my job!

1385
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:13,160
We'll get you another job.

1386
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:15,762
Eight minutes until
Christmas Day, Jack.

1387
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:16,963
Dance with me.

1388
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:19,299
Jack, no, we don't
have enough time!

1389
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,179
1958 was
a very good year.

1390
01:12:32,248 --> 01:12:33,313
Ooh.

1391
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:34,981
I'll say.

1392
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:36,050
Oh, Jack, no.

1393
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:37,717
There is something
that I have to tell you.

1394
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,853
I know.
You love me.

1395
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:40,987
No!

1396
01:12:41,057 --> 01:12:43,190
Uh, I mean--
I mean, yes, probably.

1397
01:12:43,259 --> 01:12:44,724
I love you, too.

1398
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:45,959
Just listen to me!

1399
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,127
This isn't about us.

1400
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,430
This is about you
and what is gonna happen in...

1401
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:50,697
seven minutes.

1402
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:52,566
If we don't get you
back in time,

1403
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:54,901
then all of your Christmases
will no longer be.

1404
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,336
Uh-huh.

1405
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:59,639
And that means
that old Jack Cameron
will cease to exist.

1406
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,041
So?

1407
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,909
So if you cease to exist,
that means you were
never married!

1408
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:04,678
My God, that's
good news, honey!

1409
01:13:04,746 --> 01:13:06,513
Jack, that means...

1410
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:09,083
you never had Suzanne.

1411
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,318
So my daughter...

1412
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:14,188
Will never be.

1413
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:16,957
No. You can't do that.
See, that's unacceptable.

1414
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:19,926
If it's me,
that's one thing,
but not her.

1415
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:21,361
Believe me,
she's special.

1416
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,730
That kid, I promise you,

1417
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:25,566
makes the world
a better place
to live in.

1418
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:27,767
Five minutes, Jack.

1419
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,443
You!

1420
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:37,944
Yes!

1421
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:47,221
Oh!

1422
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,360
Come back,
you scum little man!

1423
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:00,700
Whoa!

1424
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:03,036
Oh! Sorry!

1425
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:11,011
Why did he have to
break that snowflake?

1426
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:26,926
[clang]

1427
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,529
Hey!

1428
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:34,734
Oh.

1429
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:37,638
Get back over here!

1430
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:40,240
Okay, here goes.

1431
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,775
Uh!

1432
01:14:41,843 --> 01:14:44,494
Oh!

1433
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:47,031
Oh, my...

1434
01:14:47,099 --> 01:14:49,733
Ow!

1435
01:14:49,802 --> 01:14:51,601
- That hurt!
- Hey!

1436
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:53,703
You're not gonna take
my daughter away from me.

1437
01:14:53,772 --> 01:14:56,440
Too late.
It's Christmas Day!

1438
01:14:56,508 --> 01:14:58,208
Not yet, it isn't!

1439
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,513
Jack, 15 seconds.

1440
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,549
So I better go now, huh?

1441
01:15:05,617 --> 01:15:07,117
What? Are you crazy?

1442
01:15:07,186 --> 01:15:09,153
Probably,
but it'll be fine!

1443
01:15:10,389 --> 01:15:11,989
Don't worry!

1444
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,893
Not so fast.

1445
01:15:16,963 --> 01:15:18,996
- Oh!
- Why did you stop me?

1446
01:15:19,065 --> 01:15:21,999
- Future?
- Future?

1447
01:15:22,068 --> 01:15:27,338
You people certainly know
how to create a mess.

1448
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,510
[Jack]
Who's that?

1449
01:15:33,579 --> 01:15:34,778
That's, uh, my boss.

1450
01:15:34,847 --> 01:15:36,613
Oh, hey,
she did a great job.

1451
01:15:36,682 --> 01:15:39,249
That other guy, he's rotten,
but she's pretty great.

1452
01:15:39,318 --> 01:15:41,918
Nice to see you all.

1453
01:15:41,988 --> 01:15:44,754
Past, you have done
the most selfish thing

1454
01:15:44,823 --> 01:15:46,357
anyone has ever done
in the history of time.

1455
01:15:46,425 --> 01:15:47,757
And I checked.

1456
01:15:47,826 --> 01:15:50,361
Yeah, well,
I'm not sorry
for what I did.

1457
01:15:50,429 --> 01:15:52,162
I know, and that's why
you're being replaced.

1458
01:15:52,231 --> 01:15:54,398
Replaced?

1459
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:55,832
You can't
replace me!

1460
01:15:55,901 --> 01:15:56,933
Why not?

1461
01:15:57,003 --> 01:15:58,702
Because!

1462
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:01,605
I'm the Ghost
of Christmas Past!

1463
01:16:01,673 --> 01:16:05,976
I've been doing this
for 2,000 years!

1464
01:16:06,045 --> 01:16:09,046
Who could possibly be
qualified to replace me?

1465
01:16:09,115 --> 01:16:13,884
Well, we held a meeting,
and decided on someone
with a strong spirit,

1466
01:16:13,952 --> 01:16:16,387
someone who would appreciate
the past for what it is,

1467
01:16:16,455 --> 01:16:18,055
someone who, in retrospect,

1468
01:16:18,124 --> 01:16:21,725
has been overlooked
and neglected for 2,000 years.

1469
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,495
You.

1470
01:16:25,697 --> 01:16:26,863
Me?

1471
01:16:26,932 --> 01:16:28,399
Her?!

1472
01:16:28,467 --> 01:16:29,466
That's right.

1473
01:16:29,535 --> 01:16:32,036
The head office decided
it would be best.

1474
01:16:32,104 --> 01:16:33,870
You've been deprived
of the past for so long,

1475
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:37,241
you'll be granted
the knowledge
of all of it.

1476
01:16:37,309 --> 01:16:39,276
Hey!

1477
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:42,479
What about me?
What am I supposed to do?

1478
01:16:42,548 --> 01:16:45,015
Don't worry.
We have a position
all lined up for you.

1479
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:58,962
[laughing]

1480
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:03,600
[screaming]

1481
01:17:03,668 --> 01:17:04,601
Is she okay?

1482
01:17:04,669 --> 01:17:06,103
She'll be fine.

1483
01:17:06,171 --> 01:17:08,438
She was just given
the memories of
all of civilization.

1484
01:17:08,506 --> 01:17:10,506
Give her a moment
to adjust.

1485
01:17:10,575 --> 01:17:14,695
I want my mommy.
I want my mommy!

1486
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:15,729
[crying]

1487
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:18,899
Mommy!

1488
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:23,203
Ahh!

1489
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:26,406
Ahh.

1490
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,108
So what happens to me?

1491
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:29,777
It's Christmas.

1492
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:31,344
You get to go home.

1493
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:34,548
And I'll take you.

1494
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,491
Whoa, it's here.
It's still here.

1495
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,443
Oh.

1496
01:17:46,512 --> 01:17:47,444
What a night, huh?

1497
01:17:47,513 --> 01:17:49,479
It was great.

1498
01:17:49,548 --> 01:17:51,381
And what you said
to your wife

1499
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:53,483
was pretty good.

1500
01:17:53,552 --> 01:17:55,485
It felt good.

1501
01:17:57,022 --> 01:17:58,821
Oh, Jack, you and I...

1502
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:01,158
No, you don't have
to say anything.

1503
01:18:05,063 --> 01:18:06,996
I gotta...

1504
01:18:07,065 --> 01:18:09,399
Just try not to forget me.

1505
01:18:09,468 --> 01:18:11,201
Oh, I won't.

1506
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,002
I will always
remember you...

1507
01:18:13,071 --> 01:18:15,772
now that I can.

1508
01:18:18,143 --> 01:18:20,109
Merry Christmas, Jack.

1509
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,348
God bless us, every one.

1510
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:26,383
Mmm!

1511
01:18:37,262 --> 01:18:39,062
Dad?

1512
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:40,197
Honey!

1513
01:18:40,265 --> 01:18:43,266
Oh! Oh, thank God
you're here, baby.

1514
01:18:43,335 --> 01:18:45,335
How are you?
Oh, boy!

1515
01:18:45,404 --> 01:18:46,670
Where have you
been all night?

1516
01:18:46,738 --> 01:18:48,004
What day is it?

1517
01:18:48,073 --> 01:18:50,173
Well, it's Christmas Day.

1518
01:18:50,242 --> 01:18:51,174
It's Christmas!

1519
01:18:51,243 --> 01:18:52,242
Oh, great!

1520
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:53,943
Perfect! Thank you!

1521
01:18:54,012 --> 01:18:55,545
Oh!

1522
01:18:55,614 --> 01:18:56,779
Are you drunk?

1523
01:18:56,848 --> 01:18:57,947
No!

1524
01:18:58,016 --> 01:19:01,551
No, I haven't had a drink
since 1978.

1525
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:04,187
Look, Dad, I'm sorry
for calling you a psycho.

1526
01:19:04,256 --> 01:19:05,422
No, honey.

1527
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:07,824
Don't be sorry
because I was a psycho.

1528
01:19:07,892 --> 01:19:10,594
I was a crazy psycho!

1529
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:12,195
You are drunk.

1530
01:19:12,264 --> 01:19:14,231
No, no, no,
listen to me, baby.

1531
01:19:14,299 --> 01:19:16,366
Christmas should
never be forgotten.

1532
01:19:16,435 --> 01:19:18,235
It's a time to be kind
to strangers and--

1533
01:19:18,303 --> 01:19:20,437
and celebrate life.

1534
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:22,372
Merry Christmas,
sweetheart!

1535
01:19:24,109 --> 01:19:25,242
Merry Christmas, Dad.

1536
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:26,743
Okay.

1537
01:19:26,811 --> 01:19:28,278
Okay, go get changed.

1538
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,546
Where are we going?

1539
01:19:29,615 --> 01:19:31,414
We're gonna go spread
some Christmas joy.

1540
01:19:31,483 --> 01:19:34,050
Are you kidding me?
Come on! Hey!

1541
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:37,454
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1542
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:40,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1543
01:19:40,459 --> 01:19:43,593
Merry Christmas to you, too.
