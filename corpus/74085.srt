1
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,197
Test, test, test.

2
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,158
This is a test.

3
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,287
One, two, test.

4
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,676
Kid?

5
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,390
Are you lost, kid?

6
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:42,287
Hi. Where's your big brother, kid?
- I don't have one.

7
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,541
Yeah? Don't you look a little
too kiddy like to be in college?

8
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,793
You still wetting the bed?

9
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,337
Oh, congratulations.
Now, here's the deal.

10
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:55,467
I listen to ska music, right? Just ska.

11
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,553
No rap, punk, hip-hop, heavy metal...

12
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,430
classical, classic rock,
new wave, New Age...

13
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,226
bluegrass, blues, jazz
and no fucking country.

14
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,979
I am not bumpkin
like the rest of you pukes.

15
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:11,108
And I get the bottom bunk.

16
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,637
Better watch your ass, punk.
- Yeah, punk.

17
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,098
You see us again,
you'd better watch out, kid.

18
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,475
Yeah, kid.

19
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,922
Hello, my name is Jones Dillon.
I'm calling about the apartment.

20
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,382
I can show it to you now.
Tomorrow's fine too.

21
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,926
No, now would be good.

22
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:57,589
I got the St. Louis blues

23
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:02,678
And I'm blue as I can be

24
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:07,432
Because my baby...
That's very pretty, miss.

25
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,185
Oh, thank you.

26
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,605
I don't know. Aren't you
a little young to rent an apartment?

27
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,066
No, miss. I'm a legitimate border.

28
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,237
What's that there?
- Just my things.

29
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:25,492
I see, but most people I rent to like
to see the place before they take it.

30
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,077
Okay.

31
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,846
There are two white girls upstairs,
and a white man has the first floor.

32
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,975
You'll be just fine here, Jones.
Snug like a bug.

33
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,188
Thank you.

34
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,662
What is this?
- My rent check?

35
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,625
Twelve thousand dollars?
- That was the figure on the lease.

36
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,590
It's my grandfather's money.
Or it was, anyway.

37
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,593
He went to college here,
and the will said I had to too.

38
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,386
I didn't want to go to Texas.

39
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:30,224
What's in Texas?
- Just my mother.

40
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,547
You'll be glad to know
I dropped out of college.

41
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,423
You told me all a writer needs...

42
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,385
is his eyes and ears
and sense enough to use them.

43
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:10,347
Besides, you know I don't play well
with the other kids.

44
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,060
Better watch your ass, punk.
- Yeah, punk.

45
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,559
You know how much this means to me.
Don't be like that.

46
00:07:55,726 --> 00:08:00,772
Look, I'll be here.
Don't be this way.

47
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,609
I'll just hang up right now.

48
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:07,487
I'm hanging up now. Asshole.

49
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,979
Well, well, well. Come in, come in.

50
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,690
I don't know what you're after,
but make no mistake...

51
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,944
you have come to
absolutely the right place to get it.

52
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,323
You can call me 'Mother.' I am the
woman of this house. And you I call...?

53
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,287
You listen to Mother,
because she speaks the truth.

54
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:01,917
There is nothing, absolutely nothing
as important as a bed.

55
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,545
Nothing?

56
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:09,383
A happy bed makes
for a happy home, Mr. Jones.

57
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,052
If you take my meaning.

58
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:21,812
Jones. I knew a man
named Jones once. Yes, indeed.

59
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,022
Maybe he was your daddy.

60
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:29,236
I doubt it, miss.
- Well, I wouldn't be too sure, now.

61
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,739
He was a handsome devil,
just like you are.

62
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:46,461
Phone?
- I don't have one yet. I'll get one.

63
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:51,800
Well, you be sure and let Mother know
just as soon as you do.

64
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:55,888
Hi, Mother.
- Oh, boys, this is Mr. Jones.

65
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:59,016
Will you tell him when you can
deliver him his furniture?

66
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,643
Be a week at least.
- Be at least a week, maybe two.

67
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,771
Could be two.
- That's okay. Fine.

68
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,025
We aren’t asking.
- No one's asking you nothing.

69
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,693
Now, you boys shut the hell up...

70
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,905
talking to my customers like that.
Now, get out.

71
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,408
Sorry, Mother.
- Go on.

72
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,035
Get.

73
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,371
From my second husband.

74
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,479
Kid, you aren’t 21.

75
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:50,192
Twenty-two, 23 in December.
You can see there.

76
00:10:56,448 --> 00:11:02,037
My mother, she was deep
into all of it: booze, pills...

77
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,581
everything she could get her hands on.

78
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,125
I was born 10 weeks premature.

79
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,795
By the time doctors discovered
the bone disease...

80
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,339
it was too late to treat properly.

81
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,926
I've been suffering
since before I was born.

82
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:19,304
Damn.

83
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,598
Do you need anything else?

84
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:27,187
A pack of cigarettes.
- Just a second. Anything else?

85
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,024
A pack of cigarettes.

86
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,049
Scheiss auto.

87
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,833
Brad?

88
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,086
Come on.

89
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:40,677
Hi. I'm...

90
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,935
Think you can mess with me,
you little bastard?

91
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,439
Think you can?

92
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,239
Hi, Jane.
- Hi, Brad.

93
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,492
Who's your friend?
- Asshole tried to attack me.

94
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,703
Bad boy. Think I should shoot him?

95
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,289
No, I'll do it.

96
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,002
Well, well, well. Look here.

97
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:18,757
Caught yourself a deviant, did you?
- I live here, you lunatics.

98
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,303
What?
- Boy says he lives here, miss.

99
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:26,890
I'm in 2B, upstairs. I just moved in.

100
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,768
He's making it up.

101
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:36,275
Listen, hot stuff, are you 2B or not?
- Yes, damn. I'm 2B.

102
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,569
Well, all right.
I just got you wired up...

103
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:41,363
for the great wide world
and everything in it.

104
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,956
I saw the whole thing.

105
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,004
It was a mistake.

106
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:01,884
Don't be so sure. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

107
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,138
Come on.

108
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,780
This makes us neighbors, I suppose.

109
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,575
I'm Lisa.
- I'm Jones. Hi.

110
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:30,954
Hi. You can keep them if you want.
Call it a housewarming.

111
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,539
Thank you.

112
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,792
I'd ask you to stay...

113
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,505
And I'd ask you, where would I sit?

114
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,301
You can sit here.

115
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:48,430
I think it's much too soon
for that, don't you?

116
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,225
Goodbye, Jones.

117
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,484
Hello?
- Hello, Blanche. Guess who.

118
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,862
Lovely, my only begotten son.

119
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,073
They kicked you out of school already?

120
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,951
I wasn't expecting this call
for at least a month.

121
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,954
Relax, Blanche, you'll spill your drink.

122
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,373
I'm calling with good news.

123
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,500
I'm calling from my very own phone...

124
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:20,170
from the comfort
of my very own apartment.

125
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:25,175
You’re what?
Have you lost your mind, Jones?

126
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,971
If there's anyone in this world who
cannot take care of himself, it is you.

127
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,890
Do you hear me?
- No, you're right.

128
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,810
In fact, I've been
interviewing help all week.

129
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,479
I'm leaning towards
this beautiful Asian girl.

130
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:40,566
Cantonese.
- Cantonese, I mean.

131
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:43,026
She's expert
in ancient massage techniques.

132
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,237
See there? I knew it.

133
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:49,408
All those prep schools turned you
into a little sex monster, didn't they?

134
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:53,537
I called to ask you something.
- Oh, God, here we go.

135
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,790
I'm going to need a copy
of my birth certificate for school.

136
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:00,252
Yeah, I bet. Well, have the school
get in touch with me, then.

137
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,297
I have a right, Blanche.
- For Christ sakes, Jones...

138
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,007
couldn't we have a conversation...

139
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,510
...where you didn't dredge
all the footnotes of your ancestry?

140
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,470
What if I called your father a footnote?

141
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,515
Just don't call him
a manipulative son of a bitch.

142
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:15,684
I'd hate for us to agree on something.

143
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:20,230
I think my own father would
like to know where I am, what I'm doing.

144
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:24,735
It's late. You probably
have school tomorrow. Jones?

145
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:28,071
Don't you dare. Jones? Well, son of a...

146
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,948
Bitch.

147
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,704
I have done something to make you angry?

148
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,248
No, not you.

149
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:55,974
Yes, indeed, Mr. Jones.

150
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:59,228
A happy bed makes for a happy home...

151
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:05,150
and Mother here is going to show you
just how happy a home can be.

152
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:10,739
My bed hasn't been delivered yet.
- Just you leave everything to me.

153
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,369
I'd have called first
if I had that number.

154
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,457
Yes, indeed, Mr. Jones.

155
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,473
Get comfortable, Mr. Jones.

156
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:49,194
Oh, Jones, you area handsome devil.

157
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,947
Oh, my. Yes.

158
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,747
Let me feel how happy you are.

159
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:07,129
Mr. Jones, you're a happy daddy now.

160
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,049
Kinky. Wild.

161
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:28,150
Mr. Jones.
Rough, just like your daddy was.

162
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,089
Damn.

163
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,773
No, don't.

164
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:14,238
One, two...
- No.

165
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,545
Boy, there's something
you probably ought to know.

166
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,756
You got shit-wipe
sticking out of your fly.

167
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,307
Don't. Please.
- One, two...

168
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,725
Freeze.

169
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:48,021
Put it down, fellows. Nice and easy.

170
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:52,234
We can't very well do nothing,
being as we is frozen and all.

171
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,653
Bad joke, daddy-o.

172
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,283
One more and I blow your little
sister’s friend out of your trousers.

173
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,510
Think they treat all customers that way?

174
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,638
No, you're just lucky.
- Lucky you were there.

175
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,599
There, that's all of it.
- Wow.

176
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:27,144
If you hadn't shown up, I don't know.
Let me get you a beer.

177
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:31,148
'Freeze.' The looks on their faces.

178
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:33,775
Hi, Brad.
- Who guessed they could be polite?

179
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:37,029
You go easy on him.
- Okay.

180
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,328
Easily the most exciting thing
I’ve ever seen in real life.

181
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:47,498
Hi.
- Hi. Where is...?

182
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,458
Gone.

183
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:53,462
Look. Now you can stay.

184
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:56,882
You want a beer?
- I'm taking a rain check.

185
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,468
I have lines to learn.
- You're an actress?

186
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,971
The female lead.

187
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:06,517
Besides, I still don't know
where I would sit.

188
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,977
Are you sure that's clean?

189
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,444
Your stalker has furniture.

190
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,924
You okay?

191
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:42,886
Yeah, sure. How are you?

192
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:46,515
Great couch.

193
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:55,232
Dear Dad: I'm settling
into apartment life just fine.

194
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,735
I know it was more your stiletto
move around a lot, place to place...

195
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:01,613
but I think I'll stay right here
for now. And why not?

196
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,409
It seems like every time I turn around,
I make new friends.

197
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:29,391
Jiminy. Let's get.

198
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,476
Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming.

199
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:34,521
Come on. Come on, baby.

200
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,722
No, no, darling, they’ve waited
long enough. I’ve waited.

201
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:52,933
Oh, how I've waited for you.

202
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:57,187
Each day a lifetime centuries
longer than the day before it.

203
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,565
And it would've been...

204
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:02,693
Would've been...

205
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,946
Almost bearable.

206
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,115
And it would've been almost bearable...

207
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:12,327
if just once, you'd written a letter
that you were still alive...

208
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,539
and that your love for me
was still alive too.

209
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:20,294
How could I have known
you lost both your arms in battle?

210
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:25,841
Damn you. Haven't I told you
never to speak of that?

211
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:30,345
You foolish, proud man.
Don’t you see it doesn't matter?

212
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:34,850
You can still touch me.
Still a heart to love me.

213
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:39,688
Still lips to kiss me.
You can touch me without arms...

214
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:43,358
and I need you to,
darling, desperately.

215
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:48,280
Please touch me. Touch me now.

216
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,533
Touch me right now.

217
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:58,707
Blah, blah, blah. God, it's awful.

218
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:01,502
Well, you're good.
- Really?

219
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,630
I mean, not just compared to you?

220
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:18,519
A glass, please?
- Oh, well, I don't have any yet. Sorry.

221
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:25,192
I find it awfully sad, really.
- Well, I'm going to get some.

222
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,153
No, not that.

223
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,994
You know, a person can pursue something.

224
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:38,705
A girl can go after her
dreamland give it her...

225
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:42,918
energy, labor, sweat, tears...

226
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:47,297
and this is where it gets her.

227
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:52,845
A two-room apartment and a role
in some moronic period play.

228
00:25:57,266 --> 00:26:03,105
Things take time?
- Right, things take time.

229
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:08,485
I suppose, but I can't wait forever.

230
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:16,285
Can I ask you something?
- Sure. You can ask me anything.

231
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,871
Who's the girl with the camera?

232
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:23,458
She's called 'Jane.' Why?

233
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:27,713
Well, she took my picture out here.

234
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,800
She didn't say a word,
just took my picture and disappeared.

235
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:35,053
It was weird.
- She is weird.

236
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,681
You know what?
I’d be careful if I were you.

237
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:41,435
She took pictures of me once,
and now she hates me.

238
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:45,856
Hates you? Why?
- I have no idea...

239
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:48,859
except I think
she’s maybe slightly insane.

240
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:51,486
Insane?

241
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:07,187
Hey, this is Steve.
I’m not here right now...

242
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:37,176
Hi, I'm Jones.
I'm your neighbor from down the hall.

243
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:40,137
I think we're past that.
- Right.

244
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:43,682
I noticed you take pictures,
and I can't seem to figure this out...

245
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:47,102
so I thought maybe you could...

246
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:49,980
I don't know much about them.
Is this one any good?

247
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:54,651
Yeah, it's fine. Fine if you're going
to Disneyland with the wife and kids.

248
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:59,865
Right. Well, I guess I'll have
to plan a trip, then. And a wedding.

249
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:04,411
Here. Point and shoot.
- Right.

250
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:07,539
How did that picture come out,
on the roof?

251
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:11,084
Not so hot.

252
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:15,214
What did you say your name was?

253
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:17,591
I'm Jane.

254
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:20,719
Bye, Jones.

255
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:29,061
Ready?

256
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:34,233
Beer?
- No, no, this calls for wine.

257
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,196
I have a terrific bottle I've been
saving. You have a corkscrew, right?

258
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:41,907
Damn.

259
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:53,168
Here, let me. It's a sticky one.

260
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:01,885
And that's how it started.

261
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:04,096
She opened the wine
and started to pour...

262
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:07,641
and pour and pour,
like words on a page...

263
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:11,144
big words like 'ambition'
and 'inspiration' and 'passion'.

264
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,231
Me? I didn't say much,
but she didn't mind.

265
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:15,858
She knew I was watching her.

266
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:19,653
I think she likes to be looked at,
but I wanted to do more than look.

267
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:22,865
After all, I couldn't type, could I,
if I didn't touch the keys?

268
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,367
And she was so close.
It should have been easy...

269
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:28,495
but somewhere, somehow,
I think I missed something.

270
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,455
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

271
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:33,083
You do?
- No.

272
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:36,587
You don't?
- I don't know.

273
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:45,429
I'm sorry. It's late.
I’m drunk. I have to go.

274
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:33,810
Morning, partner.

275
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:41,360
Shouldn't I have handcuffs too?

276
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:44,738
Sorry, partner. I've only got one pair.

277
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:47,324
Don't you think
we should drink them first?

278
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:51,870
No. You'd never hit them that way.

279
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:03,006
That's right. Steady.
Use your sight. Line it up.

280
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:06,343
Now, what are you going to do?
- Squeeze.

281
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,428
Squeeze.

282
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:11,682
What are you not going to do?
- Pull.

283
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:14,977
Beautiful. Whenever you're ready.

284
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:24,486
Perfect. You squeezed.

285
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:28,217
So, what do you think of Lisa?
- Lisa?

286
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:31,053
Yeah, upstairs Lisa.

287
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,388
How do you mean?

288
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:37,601
Well, you're seeing her, aren't you?
- Did she say something to you?

289
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:41,522
No. I just know.

290
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:45,526
How?
- It's an old house. I know the creaks.

291
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,277
I know what goes on.

292
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:50,280
When she's in her bathroom
brushing her teeth...

293
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:52,366
putting on a bit of eye makeup.

294
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:56,328
I hear her move
from her apartment to yours.

295
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,123
You let her in. She looks great.

296
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,252
She takes a seat on the couch,
makes herself comfortable.

297
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:07,965
You offer her something to drink
and excuse yourself to the kitchen.

298
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:11,218
'Mineral water?
Or I have a light beer. '

299
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:14,596
'Mineral water, please.
In a glass, if you don't mind?'

300
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:18,892
Mineral water?
- Oh, come on.

301
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,770
It's not like I'm snooping, really.
I just hear it.

302
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:26,733
There's a lot of turnover upstairs.
Everybody leaves a story behind.

303
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:30,237
Now, I could tell those stories,
but I don't.

304
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:33,282
And I won't tell yours either, Jones.

305
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:41,582
Together this time. Six on the left
are mine, right are yours.

306
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,463
I love what you're doing with the place.
- Thanks.

307
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:50,966
It's called acting.
- Right.

308
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:54,219
That, that...
- Thing?

309
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:57,472
That thing is a product of...

310
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,017
Product of...

311
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:59,535
Hello? Hello? I can hear you breathing.

312
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,495
Jane?

313
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:13,215
Listen to me, you pathetic bastard.
- How did you know it was me?

314
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:17,261
You think you're cute, don't you?
Oh, for Christ sakes, Jones.

315
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:22,224
You cook a meal for a man just once.
He thinks he can call you on the phone.

316
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:26,228
What he thinks is that he's
got God-given right to tell me...

317
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:29,898
what to do, where to go,
and what time to be there.

318
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:34,361
Maybe he wants to show youth world.
Istanbul. Mozambique.

319
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:37,698
What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

320
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:41,702
My father. You said he'd been
everywhere, seen everything.

321
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:46,123
That he'd written it all down.
Every sight, every sound.

322
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:49,501
So that he could show you the world.
- I never told you that.

323
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:53,672
He told me that.
I remember more than you think I do.

324
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:59,178
I'm getting dressed here, Jones.
- What did you do, Blanche?

325
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:01,972
What did you do
that was so bade left both of us?

326
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:07,978
If you gave school half the energy you
give this little genealogy project...

327
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,606
I bet they'd name building after you.

328
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,357
I am taking it seriously.

329
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:16,445
In fact,
there's an instructor here now.

330
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:19,781
Oh, instructor, hell. What instructor?
- It's art class.

331
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:21,617
We're doing nudes this week.

332
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:26,830
But she said I could sketch
some gin bottles for extra credit.

333
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:29,333
I'll send you one.

334
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:59,279
How I’ve waited for you.

335
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:03,283
Each day a lifetime centuries longer
than the day before it.

336
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:05,202
And it would've been almost bearable...

337
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:09,540
if just once, you'd written me
that you were alive...

338
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:12,167
and that still loved me too.

339
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,169
Damn you.

340
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:17,381
I thought I told you
never to speak of that.

341
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,174
Never.

342
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:31,979
I know you got it, you chicken shit.

343
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:37,776
You can still touch me.
Still a heart to love me.

344
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:41,655
Still lips to kiss me.
You can touch me without arms...

345
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:48,036
and I need you to,
darling, desperately.

346
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:51,999
Please touch me.

347
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:59,506
Touch me right now.

348
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:07,931
At least someone's been rehearsing.

349
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:13,145
It was bad, wasn't it?

350
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,523
You can tell me.

351
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,444
You were good.

352
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:26,408
Can you say that again, please,
with just a little bit more feeling?

353
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:27,993
You were good.

354
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,212
Will you kiss me?

355
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:45,719
Okay because you want to,
or okay because I asked you to?

356
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:50,641
I want to.
- Will you do it now, please?

357
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:53,519
Okay, I will, but...

358
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:07,950
Sorry. I'm not very good at this.
- Oh, but you will be.

359
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:10,160
You will be.

360
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:39,773
What are you waiting for?

361
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:45,779
This isn't your first time, is it?

362
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:50,367
What?

363
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:52,369
Are you serious?

364
00:40:53,162 --> 00:40:56,957
Jones, my God.
What do you think this is?

365
00:40:57,124 --> 00:41:01,378
Nothing. I mean. God, exactly.
You know what?

366
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:04,423
You can't do this with me.
Not like this. I mean...

367
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:07,759
You're really sweet
and everything, but my God...

368
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:10,012
how old are you anyway?
- Seventeen.

369
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:15,058
Seventeen? My God, what am I doing?
You know what, Jones?

370
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:18,520
You need to fall in love first.
- Love?

371
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:21,982
Yes, love.
Seventeen-year-olds can fall in love.

372
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:25,903
By the time I was 17,
I'd already loved three or four boys.

373
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:28,947
Like really, truly, loved them.
- You're right.

374
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:32,326
Of course I'm right.
- Trust me. You don't want to do this.

375
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,454
You're right.
- You think you do, but...

376
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:39,208
What did you say?
- I said, you're right.

377
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:43,253
Right about what?
- About this, about us.

378
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:46,590
I don't want to, like you said.
- What?

379
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,765
Okay, the show's over.
I’m through being an audience.

380
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:58,352
Just looking on and listening.
I want someone who's more than words...

381
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:03,065
because if I’ve learned anything,
it's this: talk is cheap, partner.

382
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:08,403
So you say it's a party you want?
Hell, I'll show you a party.

383
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,114
What did I say
about coming down and celebrating?

384
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:14,034
Damn it, I got dishes at home
that need washing.

385
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:18,664
You done crossed me for the last time.
Speak up, damn it. I'm talking to you.

386
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:30,008
Oh, dear God, help me.

387
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:34,721
It's Jones Dillon, coming to kill me.

388
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:40,394
Please, Dillon.
I wasn't going to hurt her. Honest.

389
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:44,273
You'd best say goodbye to them buttons,
you no-arm son of a bitch.

390
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:47,067
Mr. Dillon.

391
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:50,487
You have a shave scheduled, Mr. Dillon.

392
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:54,449
A shave.

393
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,120
And a bath.

394
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,170
That's me.

395
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:12,676
But this animal said he was going
to roll me down Main Street.

396
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:17,472
Down Main Street, right out of town,
one kick at a time.

397
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,893
Squeeze.

398
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:24,229
With spurs on, Jones.

399
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:09,983
I need a ride.

400
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,822
You didn't have to do this.
- That's okay.

401
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,783
I've been meaning to buy some records.

402
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:20,786
We don't sell records.

403
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:23,831
I thought you said
it was a record store.

404
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:28,043
It's just called a record store.
It’s all CDs.

405
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:32,756
Right. I don’t have
a record player anyway.

406
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:56,155
I don't care if you don’t like
the picture, okay?

407
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:58,657
What picture?
- It's not going to hurt my feelings.

408
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:01,451
You could've at least acknowledged it.

409
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:06,331
What picture?
- The picture I gave you.

410
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:11,253
The picture I slipped under your door.
I put it in an envelope and...

411
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:17,301
Look, there's no way you didn't...
Oh, goddamn it. She likes you, right?

412
00:45:17,426 --> 00:45:21,013
Who?
- Who? The bitch that...

413
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:25,726
Just forget it, forget it. I’m sorry.

414
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:34,276
Are you coming in?
- No. I don't have a CD player either.

415
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:39,072
Will you need a ride home?
- No. I'll manage.

416
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,576
How about you?

417
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:01,803
Okay, shut it off.

418
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:06,725
That's great.
How do you know all this stuff?

419
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:10,312
I learned it from Rocky.
- Who's Rocky?

420
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:13,774
That motorcycle in my apartment?

421
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:15,692
That's Rocky.

422
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:21,532
He left that behind, the rogue.

423
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:23,617
He was my last.

424
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:28,163
He lived in your apartment for a while,
but he spent most of his time in mine.

425
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,249
Then he moved on.

426
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:33,335
That was three years ago.

427
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:42,427
It's been three years
since I had sex, Jones.

428
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:49,226
Didn't you say 'whoa'?
Three years and you say 'whoa'?

429
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:54,022
Three years of celibacy
deserves more than 'whoa.'

430
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:58,402
'Whoa' doesn't come close.
- Try 17.

431
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:03,115
What, years?
- Well, the first 12 were pretty easy.

432
00:47:03,282 --> 00:47:05,075
But what about...?

433
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:08,203
So you're a...?

434
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,889
It's great.

435
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:29,975
It's really great.

436
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:32,060
It's the pain.

437
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:33,770
The pain?

438
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:39,735
That's why I like it.
Because it's honest and it's real...

439
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,863
and it's nothing you can faker hide.

440
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:47,451
To me, it's like you're feeling pain
for the first time in your life.

441
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,455
And before this moment,
you didn't even know it existed.

442
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:57,336
I broke my arm once when I was a kid.

443
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:05,677
How is it someone you've just met,
a person you hardly know...

444
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:08,347
can somehow know you?
Can take one look at you...

445
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:11,850
and see more in that instant
than most people will ever see?

446
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:15,312
I suppose
there's only one way to find out.

447
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,446
Hi, Jane.
- Hi.

448
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:28,826
Hi. I was wondering if...

449
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:34,122
if you'd like to go out or...?
- You're a little young for me, Jones.

450
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:37,709
Besides, I don't date.
- Well, it wouldn't be a date.

451
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:40,629
I don't know many people here,
and I thought maybe we could...

452
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,881
Maybe you should get a record player.

453
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:45,717
Well, we don't have to.

454
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:50,764
I don't do movies.

455
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:54,142
No dinners, no picnics...

456
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:55,978
no walks.

457
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:58,605
How about you decide?

458
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:05,612
I hear you typing a lot.
What are you writing?

459
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:08,949
Letters, mostly.
- Letters to whom, your girlfriend?

460
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:12,369
Girlfriends.

461
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,413
There are several.

462
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:16,498
Is that right?

463
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:20,752
Get the fuck out of here.

464
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,639
Superfecta is the big one.

465
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:36,685
The first four horses in order
are bitch to win, but top-dollar pay.

466
00:49:36,894 --> 00:49:40,230
Trifecta is the same deal,
but first three horses in order.

467
00:49:40,564 --> 00:49:42,399
Still's a bitch, still good money.

468
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,110
Exacta bet is firsthand second in order.

469
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:47,821
Quinella is the same, but in any order.

470
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:50,115
So those are good.
Win, place or show bets...

471
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,992
you can figure out for yourself.

472
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:54,119
Are you talking to me?

473
00:49:54,328 --> 00:49:56,371
Yes, dummy. How do you want to bet?

474
00:49:56,497 --> 00:50:01,668
I have no idea. How about you bettor me
and I'll get us some drinks?

475
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:03,712
Sure you will.

476
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:37,579
How did you do that?
- A trick I learned from my mother.

477
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:41,083
So, what are we drinking to?

478
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:44,920
Close your eyes and point.

479
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,219
New in Town.

480
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:55,138
Yes. New in Town, run, run, run.

481
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:57,599
Baby, run.

482
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:06,817
Yes. Go, go.

483
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:13,657
Yes. Yes. Come on, come on.

484
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:40,601
Little Bee. Go on.

485
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:44,062
Go. Little Bee, run.

486
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:08,295
I used to go there a lot with Steve...

487
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:13,050
and he always lost his ass. I guess
that’s why I can still stand it there.

488
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:18,222
This is the part
where you ask me who Steve is.

489
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:20,849
No, it isn't.

490
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:24,061
Fair enough.

491
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:27,356
Then I'll ask you something.

492
00:52:27,648 --> 00:52:30,567
Name?

493
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:33,821
Age?
- Seventeen.

494
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:36,240
From?
- Texas.

495
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:41,411
No funny accent.
- I grew up in the East, mostly.

496
00:52:42,788 --> 00:52:44,248
Me too.

497
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,584
Boarding schools and summer camps.

498
00:52:47,793 --> 00:52:49,920
What about your parents?

499
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:51,547
What parents?

500
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,508
How many orphans got boarding schools?

501
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:57,219
Lots. Who's Steve?

502
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,764
I thought you didn't want to know.

503
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:03,392
He's your old boyfriend?

504
00:53:04,226 --> 00:53:05,727
One of several.

505
00:53:05,894 --> 00:53:08,063
Are you telling me you're an orphan?

506
00:53:08,522 --> 00:53:12,067
Not exactly. How many is several?

507
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:15,863
Wouldn't you like to know?
- I just want to know about one.

508
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:21,201
That's it. Out of film.
- That's it?

509
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:23,996
Why? You thought
you were getting somewhere?

510
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:33,255
So is there anything else
I should know about you?

511
00:53:33,422 --> 00:53:35,299
I don't think so.

512
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:38,802
Unless...
- What?

513
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:41,388
No.

514
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:43,515
Spill it.

515
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:48,979
I'm a virgin.

516
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:52,483
Never?

517
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:56,778
All those girlfriends and no action?

518
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,282
I almost did once.

519
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:01,992
Really, when?

520
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:04,119
Recently.

521
00:54:04,536 --> 00:54:07,831
How recently?
- Pretty recently.

522
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:13,420
I want to tell you something.

523
00:54:13,587 --> 00:54:17,341
If you want to hang out with her,
you don't hang out here, okay?

524
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:20,969
I'll hang out here.

525
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:25,682
Okay.

526
00:54:35,651 --> 00:54:38,237
I'm sorry.

527
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:42,699
I'm sorry about the kiss.

528
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:05,389
So, what do you know
about Jane and Steve?

529
00:55:05,556 --> 00:55:07,349
Can't do it. Sorry.

530
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:09,560
Can't do what?
- Can't say.

531
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,438
It's one of those upstairs stories.
Sorry.

532
00:55:13,814 --> 00:55:15,983
But you know?
- Can't say.

533
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,026
But there's something to know, right?

534
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:19,987
Is there?

535
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:22,656
Damn.

536
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:06,617
Partner.

537
00:56:07,326 --> 00:56:09,119
She's at your door.

538
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:23,467
I didn't think you were home.
- I'm not. I wasn't.

539
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:26,094
But I am now. Now I am.

540
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:28,722
Want to go for a ride?

541
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:32,017
In a half an hour?

542
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:37,022
Blanche is in Texas.

543
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:40,067
Who?
- Blanche, my mother.

544
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:43,362
You asked me about my parents.

545
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:48,492
She lives alone. Drinks.
Dates mostly men from the country club.

546
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:52,412
She ran my father off
when I was 3. Or 4.

547
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:54,957
Her story always changes.

548
00:56:58,377 --> 00:56:59,378
What?

549
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:02,214
This is the part
where you tell me about Steve.

550
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:03,882
Is that right?

551
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,885
I used to work
in this shitty little bar.

552
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:08,804
Steve came with his band, like...

553
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:11,974
they were playing
a stadium show or something.

554
00:57:12,224 --> 00:57:15,144
And for the next three nights,
he sang every song for me.

555
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:17,604
I had never met anybody like him.

556
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:20,691
He said all the right things,
did all the right things.

557
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:24,570
Everything was so right.

558
00:57:24,736 --> 00:57:27,990
Then he fucked it all up. Me especially.

559
00:57:28,157 --> 00:57:29,867
You seem okay to me.

560
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:33,287
I used to be better than okay.

561
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:16,830
New in Town.

562
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:18,749
How are you?

563
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:21,126
How do I look?

564
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:23,086
You look great.

565
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:25,923
How's your arm?

566
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:28,342
I'll pull through, I think.

567
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:30,385
Thank God.

568
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:33,430
I'm miserable, Jones.

569
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:35,307
That must hurt pretty badly.

570
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:37,643
No. I'm so bored.

571
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:40,521
Right. Maybe you
should get a record player.

572
00:58:41,271 --> 00:58:42,815
Shut up.

573
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:46,068
You know what I want?

574
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:48,362
I want you to write me a letter.

575
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:52,783
A letter?
Yeah, those you write to girlfriends.

576
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:55,661
But just a 'letter' letter,
not a love letter.

577
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:58,664
I don't have any girlfriends.

578
00:58:58,831 --> 00:59:02,042
I write them to someone else.
- Well, I'm someone else.

579
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:07,297
Write one to me.
- No, I mean... I don't send them.

580
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:09,341
It's complicated.

581
00:59:09,508 --> 00:59:12,678
Jones, I'm in the hospital.

582
00:59:13,095 --> 00:59:15,931
I think I deserve at least a letter.

583
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:20,686
I knew that something like this
was going to happen to you.

584
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:24,731
No, Blanche, really, I'm fine.
I’m going to pull through.

585
00:59:24,898 --> 00:59:27,317
You see, Jones, this is what happens.

586
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:29,361
I tell you things, and you don't listen.

587
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,363
You don't ever listen to me, do you?

588
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:33,866
Well, you don't ever
tell me what I want to hear.

589
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:39,538
Don't you start. This is about you.
This is about reality.

590
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:42,332
I'm going to have to hang up.
I’ve got breakfast coming.

591
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:45,335
There's a place that delivers
bagels and belly dancers.

592
00:59:45,502 --> 00:59:47,880
It's fantastic.
- Are you drunk, Jones?

593
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:49,840
What are you talking about?

594
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:52,676
Here she is.

595
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:57,264
You can set that down anywhere.

596
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:09,378
How did he find out?
- I called him.

597
01:01:10,462 --> 01:01:12,381
You were bored, so you called.

598
01:01:12,548 --> 01:01:16,802
Wrong. I missed him,
and I wanted to call him, so I did.

599
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:19,137
Didn't he fuck you up or something?

600
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,890
What's your problem, Jones?

601
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,893
I thought we were friends.

602
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:29,189
He came 2000 miles, Jones.

603
01:01:29,356 --> 01:01:32,401
She can't help herself, Jones.
It’s a biological weakness...

604
01:01:32,568 --> 01:01:36,238
for the black-leather/
guitar-player type.

605
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:39,491
I've experienced bouts of it myself.

606
01:01:39,658 --> 01:01:41,743
It's powerful stuff.

607
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:45,372
Well, it's good. Really.

608
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,541
I'm happy for her.

609
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:50,919
She seems happy too, which is good.

610
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:52,921
It's great.

611
01:01:53,297 --> 01:01:55,632
Grab your hammer, partner.

612
01:02:25,871 --> 01:02:28,332
Did you see Jane's car?

613
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:33,003
What happened to your arm?

614
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,216
You were with her.

615
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:39,968
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

616
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:46,350
What about Jane?

617
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:50,729
She's okay.
- I'm glad.

618
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:53,357
When something like this happens...

619
01:02:53,524 --> 01:02:57,236
it makes me wonder
if I should tell her I'm sorry.

620
01:02:57,611 --> 01:03:00,864
Well, it was the deer's fault, mostly.

621
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:12,751
Is that for me?

622
01:03:17,214 --> 01:03:19,508
I write them to my father.

623
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:23,554
I don't send them,
because don't know his address.

624
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:28,058
Because I don't know
if he's alive or dead.

625
01:03:28,267 --> 01:03:29,810
Nothing.

626
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:34,690
Only you.

627
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:38,068
Okay.

628
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:40,320
Say it.

629
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:43,699
Only me.

630
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:01,341
I'll be leaving soon.

631
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:04,386
I know.

632
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,472
I don't mean just from the hospital.

633
01:04:09,057 --> 01:04:10,642
I know.

634
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:23,780
Hey, guy.

635
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:28,285
Oh, the famous copilot.

636
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:29,995
Jones, right?
Right.

637
01:04:30,162 --> 01:04:32,498
Yeah. How's the arm?

638
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:37,127
You fucked her, didn't you?

639
01:04:37,419 --> 01:04:39,796
What?

640
01:04:43,383 --> 01:04:44,885
You?

641
01:04:46,553 --> 01:04:48,055
But it was nothing.

642
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:50,390
Nothing?

643
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:52,100
Jane took pictures of her.

644
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:55,062
Sexy stuff, where she was
wrapped in these scarves...

645
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:57,689
and I wanted to find out
what was under there.

646
01:04:57,856 --> 01:04:59,566
But...

647
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:03,362
it was nothing. And I mean,
Jane took it pretty hard.

648
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:06,657
Jane takes everything pretty hard.

649
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:14,456
What am I telling you for?

650
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:16,834
You don't even have a CD player.

651
01:05:23,423 --> 01:05:24,716
Dear Dad:

652
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:27,636
You'll be glad to know
I'm recovering from the accident.

653
01:05:27,803 --> 01:05:29,513
And that girl I told you about?

654
01:05:29,638 --> 01:05:31,431
She's as good as new.

655
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:36,436
What I can't figure out is,
how could I have been so stupid?

656
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:02,754
How?

657
01:06:03,505 --> 01:06:05,132
You're listed.

658
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:10,679
That Brad person downstairs,
he told me which apartment, so...

659
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,056
That Brad person?

660
01:06:13,223 --> 01:06:17,478
Yeah. Do you know he made a pass at me?
Wouldn't you know it?

661
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:21,356
You look nice, Blanche.

662
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:24,860
Then ask me to sit down.

663
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:33,535
Well, thank you, Mr. Sophisticated.

664
01:06:38,457 --> 01:06:40,459
I got a motorcycle.

665
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:43,170
Well, isn't that nice.

666
01:06:43,337 --> 01:06:45,547
Maybe I should throw myself
off this roof...

667
01:06:45,714 --> 01:06:48,467
save the trouble
of having to bury you.

668
01:06:48,634 --> 01:06:51,887
I don't think the fall would kill you,
but you could try it.

669
01:06:52,554 --> 01:06:54,723
Tell me about this Jane person.

670
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:58,185
Skip the part about her
being lousy driver, though.

671
01:06:58,393 --> 01:07:00,103
I don't know.

672
01:07:01,772 --> 01:07:04,650
She's a lot like you, actually.
- That's exactly what happens.

673
01:07:04,817 --> 01:07:09,404
Boys always chase after girls
that remind them of their mothers.

674
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:11,990
She drinks, she's rude,
and she’s loud...

675
01:07:12,157 --> 01:07:14,910
Yeah, okay. Shut up, will you?

676
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:17,663
Is she pretty?

677
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:20,499
She's beautiful.

678
01:07:27,464 --> 01:07:28,841
What about you, Blanche?

679
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:32,261
Are you making anyone miserable
on a regular basis?

680
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:36,223
If that's your cute way of asking
if I'm in love with anybody...

681
01:07:36,431 --> 01:07:38,809
...the answer is no.

682
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:40,727
Come on, Blanche.

683
01:07:40,894 --> 01:07:44,982
Well, sure, there might be times
when I'm sweet on a man.

684
01:07:45,149 --> 01:07:48,443
I like to feel good
as much as the next girl.

685
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:53,282
But don't confuse feeling good
with being in love, Jones.

686
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:57,077
No, those two roads, they rarely cross.

687
01:07:57,202 --> 01:07:59,788
Rarely or never?

688
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:07,462
Why are you still dragging around
that beat-up trunk?

689
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:11,758
That's all I have.
That and his typewriter.

690
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:18,515
Well, why don't you see if you’ve got
a blanket in there for me.

691
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:22,144
I guess it's getting late.

692
01:08:23,645 --> 01:08:25,439
We'll talk tomorrow.

693
01:08:28,484 --> 01:08:30,027
Tomorrow.

694
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:14,358
Jones, watch the road.

695
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:20,614
It's beautiful.
You guys are unbelievable.

696
01:11:20,781 --> 01:11:23,033
Well, all I did was beat on it.

697
01:11:26,495 --> 01:11:28,580
How would you like to drive it?

698
01:11:29,498 --> 01:11:32,793
Around the block, or 2000 miles one-way?

699
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:41,176
I'll do it.

700
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:44,555
Why would you do it?

701
01:11:44,721 --> 01:11:46,473
We're friends, right?

702
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,893
Yeah, we're friends.

703
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,465
Poor guy. He's crying.

704
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:25,262
Crying, wow.
I'll only be gone for a couple of days.

705
01:12:27,598 --> 01:12:31,518
Shut up, Jones, and drive.
- Right.

706
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:54,041
'I'm sorry, Jones.
I don't have any answers.

707
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:58,378
Not many anyway, and probably none
that would make you very happy.

708
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,841
No one ever looked at me
the way your father did.

709
01:13:03,008 --> 01:13:05,636
He didn't see a pretty girl
with a rich daddy.'

710
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:10,432
He saw someone with hopes
and dreams of her own.

711
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:13,060
And I would have followed him anywhere.

712
01:13:13,268 --> 01:13:17,439
Well, we only got as far
as a little cabin in a motor court.

713
01:13:17,564 --> 01:13:23,028
I made eggs and toast in the kitchen,
and we laughed, made love...

714
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:24,571
and drank whiskey.

715
01:13:24,738 --> 01:13:29,618
I wasn't more than 50 miles
from home, but it felt like 5000.

716
01:13:29,785 --> 01:13:35,541
And those two little rooms, they felt
like the whole wide world to me.

717
01:13:35,707 --> 01:13:41,129
But for him, I think it was
just another dot on another map.

718
01:13:41,255 --> 01:13:43,549
I'm sorry, Jones.

719
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:47,928
I know I told you a lot of
pretty things about your father...

720
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:50,389
things I wanted to believe too.

721
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:54,476
But the truth is,
you never met your daddy.

722
01:13:54,643 --> 01:13:58,856
One day he went out for cigarettes,
and he never came back.

723
01:14:08,907 --> 01:14:10,784
These letters of yours are hilarious.

724
01:14:10,993 --> 01:14:13,453
I wish you'd let me show
this one to Steve.

725
01:14:13,662 --> 01:14:17,207
Where I'm tied up in the trunk
and you come to my rescue.

726
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,835
I know what he did.

727
01:14:21,336 --> 01:14:23,589
What who did?

728
01:14:23,755 --> 01:14:25,257
I know what he did.

729
01:14:38,812 --> 01:14:40,689
Trying to get me drunk?

730
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:53,160
I tried to pretend it didn't happen...

731
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:57,748
that I didn't know, that I
couldn't see it in his face.

732
01:14:58,081 --> 01:15:00,918
But why? Why pretend?

733
01:15:02,336 --> 01:15:06,048
Because I didn't want to go back
to the way it was before.

734
01:15:06,924 --> 01:15:11,553
With Steve, there's no yesterday,
no tomorrow, just now.

735
01:15:11,762 --> 01:15:14,181
Always and forever now.

736
01:15:14,807 --> 01:15:18,769
For the first time in my life,
I knew what it felt like to be free.

737
01:15:18,936 --> 01:15:20,854
Let me try.

738
01:15:21,271 --> 01:15:23,941
I could do it, Jane. I could rescue you.

739
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:25,609
You are so nice.

740
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:28,821
I could fuck Lisa if nice
is a problem for you.

741
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:36,537
We're too much alike. I could see it
in the photos I took.

742
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:40,499
I can see it now.

743
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:55,097
Are you afraid of the dark?
- I thought you'd want it.

744
01:15:55,514 --> 01:15:57,683
You can switch it off.

745
01:16:40,851 --> 01:16:43,270
This is not happening.

746
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:47,483
Say it.

747
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:50,444
This is not happening.

748
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:11,859
You know, I've been some places.

749
01:18:12,317 --> 01:18:15,529
Texas. Delaware.

750
01:18:15,696 --> 01:18:18,031
Three schools in New Hampshire.

751
01:18:18,282 --> 01:18:19,908
Kansas.

752
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:22,995
Not everywhere, so maybe I'm wrong.

753
01:18:24,204 --> 01:18:27,624
But I think you're probably the most
beautiful woman in the world.

754
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:30,711
What did you say?

755
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:33,213
Nothing.

756
01:18:36,091 --> 01:18:37,801
You said something.

757
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:41,847
I said, we're here.

758
01:18:54,985 --> 01:18:59,156
Hey, guy. I can't believe
this piece of crap actually made it.

759
01:19:07,331 --> 01:19:10,083
You can't do this.
- Don't.

760
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:11,835
What's that?

761
01:19:12,336 --> 01:19:13,712
That stays.

762
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:18,550
Right, the top-secret funny stuff.
What was I thinking?

763
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:22,930
Last night did happen.
- Please, Jones.

764
01:19:23,096 --> 01:19:26,058
What happened last night?
- Nothing.

765
01:19:26,225 --> 01:19:29,478
Nothing happened last night.
- Yes, it did, and it wasn't nothing.

766
01:19:29,645 --> 01:19:31,522
It was something.
- Stop it.

767
01:19:31,688 --> 01:19:33,398
This something I should know?
- No.

768
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:36,610
Yes, it is.

769
01:19:37,277 --> 01:19:39,238
In your dreams, kid.

770
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:43,283
What are you doing, Jones?

771
01:19:44,743 --> 01:19:47,246
Steve, stop it.

772
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:49,873
Stop it.

773
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:54,086
Get in the car, Jones.
I want to talk to you.

774
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:02,678
Why did you do that?
- Jane, what are you doing?

775
01:20:02,845 --> 01:20:05,848
Come on, open up.
- You're better than this, Jane.

776
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:07,891
You're better than okay.
- Come on.

777
01:20:08,058 --> 01:20:09,434
Give me a minute.

778
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,520
Give me a minute.

779
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:13,313
Last night was now, wasn't it?

780
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:16,650
There was no yesterday,
no tomorrow, and it still is now.

781
01:20:16,817 --> 01:20:20,320
It's not too late.
- Jones, it is tomorrow.

782
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:22,823
I'm here. I cannot go back.

783
01:20:27,369 --> 01:20:29,121
Does it hurt?

784
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:34,835
I want you to take the car.

785
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:37,880
I don't want the car.
- Take it anyways.

786
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:40,632
You fixed her.
You put her back together.

787
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:19,505
Somebody called the cops.

788
01:21:19,713 --> 01:21:23,592
Let's get the hell out of here.
- Yeah, let's go, man.

789
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:26,970
Piece-of-shit car.

790
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:29,306
Let's go. Let's go.

791
01:21:36,688 --> 01:21:40,359
Hello.
- It was me, wasn't it, Blanche?

792
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:44,822
All these years, I blamed you.

793
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:46,406
I thought it was your fault.

794
01:21:46,573 --> 01:21:48,909
But it was me, always me.

795
01:21:49,076 --> 01:21:50,744
Jones, where are you?

796
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:54,706
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
He left because you got pregnant.

797
01:21:54,832 --> 01:21:56,500
Because...

798
01:21:58,961 --> 01:22:01,004
Oh, honey.

799
01:22:02,506 --> 01:22:06,468
Because I didn't want you
to feel the way I did.

800
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,763
I thought I could at least
do that for you.

801
01:22:09,972 --> 01:22:13,142
What, so you could send me away
to school? And every summer.

802
01:22:13,308 --> 01:22:16,603
No, that was your granddaddy's doing.

803
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:21,233
He said that I'd never make
for any kind of a mother...

804
01:22:21,358 --> 01:22:23,443
and I should just take care of it.

805
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:26,155
You were my chance, Jones.

806
01:22:26,321 --> 01:22:28,157
That he might come back.

807
01:22:28,282 --> 01:22:30,200
I was your chance that he'd come back.

808
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:33,203
No. I knew he wasn't coming back.

809
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:36,665
You can't stop some people, Jones.

810
01:22:37,166 --> 01:22:40,878
They come into your life
destined to leave it.

811
01:22:41,628 --> 01:22:44,173
You can wrap your arms
tight around them.

812
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:48,802
The best that you can hope to do
is just slow them down a little...

813
01:22:48,927 --> 01:22:52,723
because there's no
holding on tight enough.

814
01:22:55,392 --> 01:22:56,727
But you were mine.

815
01:22:57,436 --> 01:23:00,189
You were my chance, and I blew it.

816
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,610
No.

817
01:23:05,903 --> 01:23:07,571
You didn't blow it, Blanche.

818
01:23:42,981 --> 01:23:44,817
Jones.

819
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:47,820
Guess what.
- You're moving out.

820
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:50,364
Guess why I'm moving out.

821
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:53,408
You got a part.
- Yes.

822
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:57,913
It's a musical on a cruise ship,
so my stuff is going into storage...

823
01:23:58,121 --> 01:23:59,957
and I'm going to sea.

824
01:24:00,332 --> 01:24:02,793
What happened to your eye?
- Oh, it's nothing.

825
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,295
Congratulations, Lisa.

826
01:24:05,587 --> 01:24:07,422
I left you something.

827
01:24:12,344 --> 01:24:14,388
It's going to be worth
something someday.

828
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:17,015
You want me to autograph it for you?

829
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:20,018
I'll just hold on to it.

830
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:55,447
Hi. Oh, brother, where you been?

831
01:25:55,656 --> 01:25:57,741
Here, hit this, man. Check it out.

832
01:26:00,452 --> 01:26:02,246
Hey, what the fuck?

833
01:26:04,414 --> 01:26:07,584
What are you doing? What are you doing?

834
01:26:10,003 --> 01:26:11,630
What are you doing?

835
01:26:15,092 --> 01:26:17,219
No talk, no rock, no rap, no crap.

836
01:26:17,427 --> 01:26:21,723
Nothing but today's
best country, 24 hours a day.

837
01:26:34,653 --> 01:26:37,656
Wait a minute. I know you.
What did I tell you, kid?

838
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:40,075
What did I tell you?
- I think you dropped this.

839
01:26:43,036 --> 01:26:45,330
This is a new shirt.

840
01:26:46,081 --> 01:26:48,292
This is a new shirt.

841
01:26:53,714 --> 01:26:56,258
Don't ever change that hair, okay?

842
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:05,452
What the hell did you do to my car?

843
01:28:07,204 --> 01:28:10,374
Sorry about that.
- Liar.

844
01:28:15,128 --> 01:28:17,297
What happened to your motorbike?

845
01:28:17,464 --> 01:28:19,591
She just quit on me.

846
01:28:20,634 --> 01:28:22,845
Nothing lasts forever.

847
01:28:24,388 --> 01:28:25,931
Right.

848
01:28:37,484 --> 01:28:40,988
Do you still think I'm the
most beautiful woman in the world?

849
01:28:42,281 --> 01:28:44,575
Shut up and drive.
