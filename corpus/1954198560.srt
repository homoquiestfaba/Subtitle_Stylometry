1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,893
Ialways want to be around

2
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:10,167
Boys, crazy boys

3
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,840
Crazy boys

4
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,642
"Cause I"m boy crazy

5
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,317
Crazy for boys

6
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,057
No, no, I wasn`t sleeping, I was just,,,

7
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:40,164
I was trying to picture how
these three women Iook now after,,,

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,105
-Nearly 40,
-,,,40 years, yeah,

9
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:46,407
-And I was just getting a Iittle nauseous,
-But Iook at the grosses on the re-release,

10
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,606
Yeah, I saw them,
Yeah, 14 million opening weekend,

11
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,273
It`s expected to do at Ieast 50,

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,786
50? And you want me to suggest
to Mr, Stern exactly what now?

13
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:58,051
-Well, sir, I was thinking,,,
-Remember your Iast thought?

14
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:01,616
Remember, huh? When we opened
the sunken treasure chest on Iive TV,

15
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,094
And what happened, Tom?
What happened?

16
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,622
-It was empty, sir, But,,,
-Right, Hold on a second, Wait, wait,

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,364
You want me to suggest to Mr, Stern
that we remake some rusty old road movie

18
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,773
-with three has-been geriatrics,
-No, no, Not remake,

19
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:21,507
Reunite the stars, and have them sing
the hits from the film on Iive television,

20
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,483
I mean, they`re icons, People would tune in
just to see if they`re still alive,

21
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,020
I wasn`t Iistening to you just now,
I was having a brilliant thought,

22
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,556
Instead of whatever you just said,
we should reunite the stars

23
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,353
and have them sing the hits of the movie
on Iive television,

24
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,395
I mean, people will tune in just to see
if they`re alive,

25
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:42,127
But there is just one problem:
They hate each other,

26
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,898
They hate each other on Jerry Springer
and that goes through the roof,

27
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,599
Okay, so who could we get to produce
this spectacle? Who could we get?

28
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,107
-Well, there is one guy,,,
-Yes?

29
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,075
,,,who might be able to help
get them together, keep the peace,

30
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,133
-Yes,
-You know, one of them is his mother,

31
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:56,581
You`re not gonna tell me who it is, are you?
You want me to beg Iike a schnauzer?

32
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,678
-It`s Wesley Westbourne, sir,
-Am I supposed to know who that is?

33
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,619
Well, he`s the one who does
the documentaries on PBS,

34
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,750
He`s been pitching this deadly idea for
a series of nineteenth century First Ladies,

35
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,919
-Well, get him into the office!
-I just warn you, though,

36
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:13,591
He`s a bit dry and pretentious,
so you may wanna humor him a bit,

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,903
I`m sorry, It just seemed Iike you thought

38
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,408
you were talking to someone
who wasn`t in the business,

39
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,072
Yeah, well, you know, I just,,,

40
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:32,508
-Mrs, Ida Saxton McKinley,
-I have goose bumps,

41
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,816
I have,,, I mean, I don`t know about you,
but keep going, This is,,,

42
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,017
-President William McKinley`s wife,
-Duh!

43
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,083
She`s only a personal idol of mine,

44
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,561
Who do you see in
the role of Ms, McKinsey?

45
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:50,126
-McKinley, Well, I thought,,,
-I have two words for you, Farrah,

46
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,374
I Iove it, I Iove it, I Iove it, We`re making it,
We`re doing it, I Iove it,

47
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,774
-Great,
-What is this, an outline?

48
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,407
Oh, my God, Iook at this, I smell ratings,
Oh, my God, I`m so excited right now,

49
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,077
I`m about to pass an Emmy,
This is fantastic, This is great,

50
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,518
Now, there is one Iittle thing I need you
to do for me first,

51
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,612
Okay?

52
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,255
So you said yes, right?

53
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,352
Connie, these women hate each other
and don`t speak,

54
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,091
I haven`t spoken to my mother in two years,
as you may recall,

55
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,225
Well, it sounds Iike you may have
to break the silence,

56
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,499
-No, I don`t have to,
-Wesley, are you telling me

57
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,132
you`re gonna give up a chance to do your
dream project just because

58
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,699
you don`t wanna talk to your mommy?

59
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,669
They`re old Iadies now,
What can they do to you?

60
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,375
Anyway, I think it`s a great idea, I`d watch,

61
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:43,379
Right after I watched your show on
Ida Stockton McKinley,

62
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:49,224
It`s Saxton McKinley,
It has no redeeming social value,

63
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,923
Hey, you guys, get in here,
You gotta check this out,

64
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,831
Tired of teen angst comedies and carnage?
Well, apparently so is the rest of America,

65
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,466
because the surprise box office winner
this weekend was the re-release

66
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,978
of the 1960s feel-good musical Boy Crazy,

67
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,606
We spoke to Boy Crazy star
and new age zealot, Kate Westbourne,

68
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,674
in her present incarnation as Mame.

69
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,147
So, Ms. Westbourne, are you surprised to be
in a hit movie again after all these years?

70
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,852
My dear, I"ve had an audience
since I was 17-years-old.

71
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,985
I can`t do this,

72
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:26,088
And I certainly make it a point never
to appear surprised. It"s not a flattering look.

73
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,826
That`s my momma,

74
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,889
But it is amazing.

75
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,836
No, this movie is one of many,
many good movies that I have made

76
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,065
over a very long career.

77
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,335
-Five minutes, Ms. Westbourne.
-Now, if you"ll excuse me.

78
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,270
That broad is a piece of work,

79
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,812
You know how some people have fantasies
of growing up in Hollywood

80
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,543
with movie-star parents?
Well, my fantasy is everyone else`s reality,

81
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,585
I wish that, instead of being adopted
by a movie star,

82
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,986
I was adopted by just regular parents
with siblings,

83
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,456
a mom cooking dinner in the kitchen,
a dad coming home from work,

84
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,390
-giving me chores,
-And you know what, buddy?

85
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,759
If that happened, you would wish
you were adopted by the movie star,

86
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,321
Well, maybe, But a different movie star,

87
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,732
One who`s, I don`t know,
capable of showing affection,

88
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,929
Who? Joan Crawford?

89
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,938
We caught up with perky Piper Grayson

90
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:11,875
at her struggling Las Vegas casino, where
she was as incessantly upbeat as ever.

91
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,242
Last week, you could hear a chip drop
in this place.

92
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,942
Then the movie came out
and now I"ve got a full house.

93
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,677
-It"s so exciting.
-She`s cute,

94
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,948
They"re winning. Come on down.

95
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:28,292
What are we talking about? I can`t do this,
I`m a serious documentarian,

96
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,228
So be that, after you be this,

97
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:34,425
Anyway, didn`t you say your mother`s
business manager robbed her blind?

98
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,960
The youngest, Peggy, is the head writer
on the irreverent sitcom, Shut Up, Momma,

99
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,371
We were unable to get an interview
with sex symbol, Addie Holden,

100
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,376
who"s been living in luxurious seclusion...

101
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,072
-Nice wig,
-...since the 1991 incarceration

102
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,946
of her mobster boyfriend,
Tony ""the Meatpacker"" Frank.

103
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:55,317
Ten years ago, Frank was imprisoned
for loan-sharking and soliciting murder.

104
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,687
Since his arrest, Ms. Holden has faithfully
visited her paramour

105
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:02,353
and she was once fined for exposing herself
through the Plexiglas window

106
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,895
during visiting hours.

107
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,100
Come on, admit it,
You`re kind of Iiking the idea,

108
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:13,667
And, hey, play your cards right and
you may even get me as an assistant,

109
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,143
I hate the idea,
But Iet`s face it, I need this job,

110
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,042
My mother needs it,
And apparently, you need it, too,

111
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,513
It`s a package deal, So, we`II do it,

112
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,041
Yeah, sure, We`II do it,
Whether or not I get these Iadies to do it,

113
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,610
that`s a whole other matter,

114
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,178
Is my husband winning?
Hit him, George! If you don`t, I will,

115
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:04,814
Everybody wave to my husband of
42 years, Bill, the big Iove of my Iife,

116
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,627
-I Iove you, honey,
-Go on, everybody, Wave to Bill,

117
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,390
Wave to Bill, He`s so cute, So cute,

118
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,892
-Hello, dear,
-Hello, Ms, Grayson,

119
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,832
I`m Wesley Westbourne,

120
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,368
Well, well! Your parents
must`ve been big fans,

121
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,640
You have the same name
as Kate Westbourne`s adopted son, Wesley,

122
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,079
-No, I am Wesley,
-Really? You don`t Iook anything Iike her,

123
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:33,076
-Well, as you mentioned, I am adopted,
-I never had to adopt,

124
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,754
AII Bill had to do was just Iook at me funny
and I got pregnant,

125
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,988
You know, after four children, I had to,,,
I had to beg him to Iook away

126
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,291
and get a vasectomy,

127
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,898
Well, now, you didn`t come here
to hear about my sex Iife,

128
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,459
-Or did you?
-No, I,,, Thank you,

129
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,799
-You can pay for it over there,
-Great,

130
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:53,861
-10 dollars,
-But, you know,,,

131
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,670
-There you go,
-Is there somewhere we can talk?

132
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:02,180
No, I couldn`t even Iook at those two again,
after what I`ve seen them do,

133
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:06,912
I just recently got over this, you know,
I mean, I almost had to see a psychoanalyst,

134
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,681
Addie and your mother were Iike rabbits,
thumping and humping

135
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,987
and the trailers were rocking,
dresses were Iifted,

136
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,086
-They were Iike, Iike,,,
-Rabbits?

137
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,255
I already said that,

138
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:23,564
No, no, No, no, They were worse than
rabbits because rabbits are cute and fluffy,

139
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,629
They don`t have breasts heaving
in front of the crew and Iittle Iace undies

140
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,301
dangled in front of the director,
They were both

141
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,705
doing the nasty with the director,

142
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,485
I can`t quite picture my mother
having relations,,,

143
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,952
Well, how do you think you were born?
You,,,

144
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,288
That`s right, that`s right,
You were adopted,

145
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:49,692
Well, knowing your mother,
I`m sure she slept with everybody

146
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:55,029
at the adoption agency, AIthough I`m sure
that menopause put an end to that,

147
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,201
-Dried me out completely,
-Wow,

148
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,799
Well, she certainly Iooks dried out,
I say that with great Iove,

149
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,937
Memory fades, you know, then
the face goes and then the bosoms go,

150
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:11,143
and the privates and the derriere,,,
No, I`m not going to face those hussies,

151
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,242
No! I`m not! No, no, no,

152
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,480
Your Iife seems so much better than theirs,

153
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,582
You have a husband and
four children who Iove you and this casino,

154
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,058
-Go away from me, now,
-This could,,,

155
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,027
-No! Get away from me!
-What`s going on?

156
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:27,589
No, And the costumes were horrible,
I Iooked Iike an egg with hair,

157
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,932
-They got the best dresses,
-I`m not gonna say it twice, mister, Scram,

158
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,972
-We could put you in any costume that you,,,
-Come on, Now, Iisten to me,

159
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,305
I`m an ex-Marine and in WWII,
I pulled a man`s face off

160
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,866
with just these two fingers,

161
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:43,006
I didn`t enjoy it,,,much, But I`d do it again,

162
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,587
I Iooked Iike a tap-dancing mushroom,

163
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,322
I`m sorry, I`m so, so sorry,

164
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,789
-I did not mean to,,,
-Don`t touch, no touching,

165
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:59,559
-No! No, no, nothing, No touch, no touching,
-I`m going, I`m going, I`m gone, I`m gone,

166
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,414
-What`s your business?
-Who is it, Leo?

167
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:30,126
Yeah, I got a message from Mr, Frank,
My father`s bunking with him in prison,

168
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,289
Put the blindfold on and send him in.

169
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,760
-The blindfold?
-She`s been in an accident,

170
00:10:56,122 --> 00:11:00,218
I just can`t believe that Tony wants me
to do this, He was the reason I retired,

171
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,523
It`s a favor for a friend,
I can`t tell you anything more than that,

172
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,729
I`m sure Tony will be proud for everyone
to see how good you Iook,

173
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,169
And you`re bound to Iook younger than
anybody else since you had the face,,,

174
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,330
Zip it, Mother,

175
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:18,309
So is everyone else doing it?
Is that Westbourne tramp doing it?

176
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:22,074
-Yeah, she`II be doing it,
-I wouldn`t be so sure about that,

177
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,844
I suppose you heard about the fight we had?

178
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:31,447
Yeah, you and Mrs, Westbourne
both had relations with the director,

179
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:36,962
Not at the same time, obviously,
I`m quite sure she wasn`t as imaginative or

180
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:43,764
sensual or acrobatic as I was,
but basically, yes, we did,

181
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:49,606
And the director, that awful Dick Preston
with the freckled penis, God rest his soul,

182
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,404
he made the first move on me,

183
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:55,937
Freckled? You know,
this is perhaps too much information,

184
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,075
I used to call him ``the Spotted Dick,``

185
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,982
-after the English pudding,
-Right,

186
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,955
Anyway, after he and I got together,
he dumped your mother,

187
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:11,286
Yes, I know, You`re Kate`s son, aren`t you?
It`s Wesley, isn`t it?

188
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,229
-How did you know?
-You`re sneaky, just Iike she is,

189
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:19,795
That red-headed witch, You don`t mind
if I call your mother a witch, do you?

190
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,396
Everyone else does,

191
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,500
Ms, Hoity-Toity here didn`t bother
to introduce us,

192
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:28,879
I`m her mother, you believe that?
I`m Miriam Hodges,

193
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,883
-You`re American?
-I`m a Yankee Doodle Dandy,

194
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,088
-But,,,
-That`s her Hollywood voice,

195
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:42,093
Can it, Mummy, dearest,
I was educated in England,

196
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:46,825
-If you say so, Countess,
-Don`t take any notice of her, She`s senile,

197
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,391
I wish I were senile,
Then I could forget how crazy,,,

198
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:54,633
One more word out of you and it`s back
to the Drool Academy for the Aged, Okay?

199
00:12:56,242 --> 00:13:01,145
AII right, Where were we?
Yes, AII right, I`II do it,

200
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:06,241
If the other two do it, But I guarantee you,
you will not talk that old bat into it,

201
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,579
I don`t think it`II be too hard to convince
my own mother,

202
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,257
Come in,

203
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,899
Hi,

204
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,844
-Get out,
-It`s so good to see you too, Mother,

205
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,276
Stop it,

206
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,784
Since you have not spoken to me
in I don`t know how Iong,

207
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,014
give me one good reason
why I should speak with you,

208
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:47,422
Well, I believe it is you
who have not spoken to me,

209
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,262
Well, we`re speaking now,

210
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,159
-I have a job for you,
-I know about this job,

211
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,604
But you did not have a job for me
when you were making

212
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,005
that Mary Todd Lincoln show,

213
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,010
And you know I wanted to play
Mary Todd Lincoln,

214
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,536
I see spirits too, And I can be dignified!

215
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:14,913
Mother, I was making a documentary
on Mrs, Lincoln,

216
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:20,254
We used old photos and drawings,
There were no actors,

217
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:26,727
You need this job, desperately, Your Iast
two business managers cleaned you out,

218
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,030
-You`re in debt up to your,,,
-I would rather get a barium enema

219
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,435
on Iive TV than work with that tramp again,

220
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,406
-What tramp?
-The one you went to before you came to me,

221
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,638
-I wasn`t born yesterday,
-Yeah, I`II say,

222
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,741
I`m offering you the chance to make a
comeback, to make some serious money,

223
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,479
Forgive me, I`m a horrible excuse for a son!

224
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,182
But why can`t I star in this TV show
all by myself?

225
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,420
I am the only one that`s still
Iegitimately working, you know that,

226
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:58,156
Addie`s a gangster`s moll and Piper
has some saloon so she can sing in it,

227
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:02,223
-Mother,
-And I,,, No! No! No! No, no, no!

228
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,132
My inner child is having such a tantrum,

229
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,474
It`s criminal what you do to my third chakra,

230
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,304
Forget it, You know what?
You`re doing great,

231
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,904
Keep doing Mame on the road and
wash your underwear out in the sink,

232
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,414
using tiny, teeny hotel soaps,

233
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:22,914
Forget that this could also help my career
so that I could support you in your old age,

234
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:27,550
Age is not exactly a heart-melter for me,
Wesley, Have a rice cake,

235
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:34,890
And don`t Iet it bother you that if you don`t
do this show, I will be forced

236
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:40,098
to write a tell-all book chronicling,
for example, that you used to beat me,

237
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,369
I wish I had,

238
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,071
How about that time that you
set my friend Jeremy on fire?

239
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,640
He got too close to my cigarette,
And, anyway, his hair grew back,

240
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:55,578
Who they gonna believe, Mother?
You or me?

241
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,713
You`re a brat,
I should never have taught you to speak,

242
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:05,327
-So what`s it gonna be?
-Write your Iittle tell-all book,

243
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,092
See how far it gets you,

244
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:21,002
-Why are we so horrible to each other?
-Well, that`s simple,

245
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,105
We have an S&M relationship,

246
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,181
Son and mother,

247
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,791
What do you mean,
you`ve never heard of Beryl Mason?

248
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,303
-She was the biggest agent in Hollywood,
-When was this?

249
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,033
In the `50s and the `60s and the `70s,

250
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,200
Well, we weren`t all raised in Hollywood,
you know?

251
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,641
Well, Iook,
Beryl is still these three Iadies` agent,

252
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,680
and if anyone could talk them into
doing the special, it would be her,

253
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,345
But I gotta tell you, she`s kind of scary,

254
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:02,444
When my mom brought me here as a kid,
I`d always get nosebleeds,

255
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,082
Okay, now the reason for you
begging me to come becomes clear,

256
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,059
Ben, if Beryl is anything
Iike what she used to be,

257
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:14,031
she stays in bed all day, eating and talking
on the phone and smoking pot and

258
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,432
watching documentaries about dead people,
It makes her feel better about herself,

259
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,130
Hold it, Wait, Then I can`t go in there,

260
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,899
because you know how I am
around people who smoke pot,

261
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:21,997
-I get a contact high,
-You`II be fine,

262
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,065
She`II behave, Let`s go,

263
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,749
-Hello, Beryl,
-I Iove this part,

264
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,553
Sit, Sit,

265
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:41,588
You gotta hand it to this country,
We really pulled it together for D-day,

266
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,822
Hitler must have felt
Iike such a total schmuck,

267
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:52,762
-So, Wesley,
-Beryl, you Iook fantastic,

268
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,535
Bull, I`m as big as a bungalow,

269
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,704
-Who`s that?
-This is Ben, Ben Collier,

270
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,474
Sit down,

271
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,043
Tell me what you need besides a drink,

272
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,548
Rose, bring in the trays,

273
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,522
Just a nice Iittle afternoon snack,

274
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,586
So, Iet`s get down to business,

275
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,463
Okay, Well, I was thinking,,,

276
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:25,231
Wait, Before you start,
Iet me put my head to one side

277
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,430
and Iisten to you with the part of my brain

278
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,634
that might believe
the crap you`re about to tell me,

279
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:36,011
Iike I already didn`t know
you went to all three of these women

280
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:39,778
without calling me, their agent!

281
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:45,586
-I was,,,
-As punishment, 15% of what they make

282
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,922
and 15%% of what you make,

283
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,428
-I don`t think,,,
-Nonnegotiable,

284
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,590
-But, I,,,
-And no Iegwork,

285
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,463
-It`s illegal,
-You`re doing the roundup,

286
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,526
Take it or Ieave it,

287
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:03,231
-Well,,,
-I said nonnegotiable,

288
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,139
-PIus I`m co-producer,
-Oh, no,

289
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,236
And if you interrupt me one more time,

290
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:12,348
I`II be directing the bloody thing
from this bed,

291
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,149
So, how Iong have you been here?

292
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:21,056
Hey! So, all the women are committed, right?

293
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,617
Well, I spoke to Beryl Mason,
It`s as good as done,

294
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,853
Done is as good as done,

295
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,491
Anything Iess than done
doesn`t quite measure up,

296
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:33,231
Wesley, we don`t need that washed-up,
has-been pothead agent, Beryl Mason,

297
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,637
It`s nonnegotiable,
I couldn`t pull it off without her,

298
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,675
-Okay, now that`s clearer,
-But I have a great idea,

299
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,610
-I`m frightened,
-Why don`t I introduce you to the Iadies?

300
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,910
And we can just sit down and
hammer out the fine points of the deal,

301
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,944
-Okay,
-Okay? Good,

302
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,155
It`s good for you? I`m so relieved,

303
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,657
Oh, my God, it`s the Pope,

304
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,235
No way,

305
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,001
And that endless shoot
in the sweltering heat,

306
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:16,013
and that idiotic flower dirndl dress
they gave me to wear,

307
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:20,017
I Iooked Iike a 15-year-old pregnant hillbilly,

308
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,883
Like it`s bad to Iook 15?

309
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:28,791
This isn`t about the costume,
It`s about Freddy, isn`t it?

310
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,092
Freddy Hunter? PIease,
I haven`t thought about him in ages,

311
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:38,865
Because if it is, I wanted to remind you
it all happened so Iong ago

312
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:43,397
-when we were so young,
-Well, Iet`s just drop it, okay?

313
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:47,309
I forgave you years ago, So Iet`s move on,

314
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,178
-Okay,
-Great,

315
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,715
-Good,
-Grand,

316
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,273
-Groovy,
-And besides,

317
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:58,652
everybody knows you`re a very sick woman,
a card-carrying nymphomaniac,

318
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,715
Nympho!

319
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:08,632
You think any woman who had a normal,
healthy sex Iife

320
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,601
was a nymphomaniac,

321
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:17,540
Well, I enjoy sex, but you,,, If a man was
on fire, you`d stamp him out and screw him,

322
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:23,809
See, I think of sex as a Ianguage
and I`m fluent in it,

323
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:29,776
You,,, Well, for you, it`s a second Ianguage,

324
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:39,992
Piper, I did you a favor
by taking away Freddy,

325
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:48,230
A favor is doing something for someone
that they are unable to do for themselves,

326
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,637
I was perfectly capable of Iosing Freddy
on my own,

327
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:59,241
After I`d had my tonsils taken out,
I couldn`t speak,

328
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:04,217
Now, you know what that must`ve been Iike
for me, So I drank,

329
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,154
And I went on a weeklong bender
that ended up with Freddy,

330
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,629
It was all in the note of atonement
I sent you,

331
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,023
I didn`t get any note,

332
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:20,202
Anyway, I was with Freddy

333
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,799
because I was in a blackout,

334
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:29,944
-What`s your excuse?
-He gave me a red convertible

335
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,041
and my mother told me to,
She thought he was Italian,

336
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:36,246
And you do everything
your mother tells you to,

337
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,781
Less, now that she`s dead,

338
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,816
The whole thing with Freddy
was a nightmare,

339
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:49,559
I mean, the man had skinny Iittle
hairless Iegs

340
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,330
and a saggy ass,

341
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:56,966
It was Iike coupling with a clothespin,

342
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:04,271
-How vivid,
-Yes, So what about the special?

343
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:08,647
I don`t need it,
You know my casino`s doing very well,

344
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,123
I mean, you couldn`t really pay me
enough money to,,, Really?

345
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,751
Well, that`s fine, That`II just do fine, I`m in,

346
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,227
Of course, I don`t Iike those
two other women,

347
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:22,756
And I still resent you, There aren`t
any tonsils Ieft in there, are there?

348
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:27,294
Because I don`t wanna worry about you
around my husband, Bill,

349
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,932
PIease, I spend most of my time in bed,

350
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:35,241
Well, from what I understand,
you can do quite a Iot of damage in bed,

351
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,047
-Wesley,
-Mother, you Iook great,

352
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:47,183
-Bill, how are you?
-Kate, It`s so Iong,,,

353
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:52,925
Nice to see you, You know, I can`t believe
that these amusing boys are businessmen,

354
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:57,628
You know, in my day, the studio executives
were all fat and ugly and smelled of cigars,

355
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,727
but you boys Iook Iike models,

356
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,909
-Ms, Holden,
-Wesley, Call me Addie,

357
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,410
-You remember my mother from Kansas?
-Of course,

358
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,720
-Ms, Mason will see you all now,
-Piper`s not here yet,

359
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,920
Don`t worry, She`s already upstairs,
It`s a Iove-in,

360
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,292
Okay,

361
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,873
-Grandma, Tom,
-Right,

362
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,479
-Hello, girls,
-Hi, Piper, You Iook wonderful,

363
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,845
-Addie,
-Piper, how are you?

364
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:46,978
Beryl,

365
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,813
One more facelift and she`II
blow her nose through her forehead,

366
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:58,422
-Excuse me, Mrs, Munster,
-It`s Gidget goes to seed,

367
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:03,466
-Someone swallowed a boulder,
-Look over there, dear,

368
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,071
It`s Queen EIizabeth and her mother Ethel,

369
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,134
-How are you, Kate?
-I`m very well, Thank you,

370
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,507
-You`re Iooking grand, I Iove your turban,
-Yes, I Iove your wig,

371
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,205
-No, no, no, It`s not a wig,
-Really?

372
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,274
AII right! Enough! AII right!

373
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,384
Let`s just get this thing over with,

374
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:29,560
I assume you and Wesley have discussed
some preliminary figures?

375
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:35,559
But I wanted to show you a number
for each of these Iadies,

376
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,964
that I think is closer to the mark,

377
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,708
Okay,

378
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,864
Ladies, will you excuse me a minute?

379
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:15,862
Come,

380
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,545
You sons of bitches,

381
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:31,681
Don`t you kids know that these women
are the only icons we have Ieft?

382
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,020
AII the men are dead,

383
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,457
I can certainly see why,

384
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,587
You want us to go to another network?

385
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,824
Because the other networks eat this stuff up,

386
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:41,888
Yeah, sure, in syndication,

387
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,697
Got to hand it to her,
she hasn`t Iost her touch,

388
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,263
No, Smoking kills,

389
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:53,300
Let her smoke, But, dear,
you really should try a thinner cigarette,

390
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:57,109
It decreases the proliferation
of the Iip Iines,

391
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,307
At Ieast I have Iips,

392
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:04,986
I think my Iittle girl Iooks wonderful,
You know, she just had a,,,

393
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:11,188
Zip it, Mother, I just had a Iittle Iiposuction,
That`s what keeps my waist so tiny,

394
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,923
Something you could use,

395
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,930
AII the fat just goes to another place,

396
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:20,404
You know, I had a friend who Iipoed her
stomach and within several months,

397
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,201
she Iooked just Iike Jabba the Hutt,

398
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:28,010
-Who`s Jabba the Hutt?
-It`s a sea slug, Mummy, from outer space,

399
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,944
And it`s not a compliment,

400
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,343
I had to have the Iipo,
I was puffy from an accident,

401
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,884
Yes, of course,

402
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:38,616
Isn`t it odd how every four years or so
you have some sort of accident,

403
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,990
and each time you end up Iooking more
and more Iike a wide-mouthed sea bass?

404
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:52,500
Ladies, we have a deal,

405
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,206
Well, Addie`s not here yet,

406
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:08,116
Well, I`m sure she has a perfectly
good explanation,

407
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:14,224
No, no, you idiot, When I ordered a shiatsu,
I meant a massage, Not a dog,

408
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,860
I`m so sorry I`m Iate,
You cannot believe what happened to me,

409
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,330
-What?
-It was an absolute nightmare,

410
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:25,392
I had to change my entire outfit because
I had a run in my tights,

411
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,907
-You sure it wasn`t a varicose vein?
-Yes, I`m quite sure,

412
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,999
And didn`t we have
a favored nations clause?

413
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:35,478
Yes, Where none of us were supposed
to bring additional people,

414
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,414
The word ``entourage`` comes to mind,

415
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,418
-``Parade,``
-You know what?

416
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,615
-What?
-You really need to do something

417
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,056
-about all these people,
-No, no, no, Tony insists I have at Ieast

418
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,218
-one bodyguard,
-No,

419
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,318
What does she need a bodyguard for?

420
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,158
Nobody would want her body
in the first place,

421
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,131
-What about Mummy?
-Okay, Mommy,

422
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,257
Okay,

423
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,165
-Thank you,
-Run on,

424
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,932
AII right, girls,

425
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,506
I am so thrilled
to be directing real stars here,

426
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,808
So why don`t we just sidle on up
to the piano here

427
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,903
-and see how much of this you remember,
-AII right,

428
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,074
-On the top of Boy Crazy.
-Yes, Boy Crazy. Great,

429
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,143
-I...
-I...

430
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:21,591
I like the way that they dance
I"m boy crazy

431
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:26,653
I... I like the cut of their pants
I"m boy...

432
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,759
Keep going, keep going,
That was great, That was great,

433
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,066
-I`II be right back,
-Is there a problem?

434
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,040
I`II be right back, too,

435
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,074
-Let`s take it from the top of the song,
-Is it okay?

436
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:44,081
-Could you do it in my key?
-No, no, That was much too Iow for me,

437
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,692
That is the funniest thing I`ve ever seen
in my entire Iife,

438
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:57,826
This is gonna be so hilarious,

439
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:02,162
-No, it`s not supposed to be funny,
-I know one of them is your mother,

440
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,726
But that is not your fault,

441
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,963
``I`m boy crazy,``

442
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,803
You know what it should be?
``I`m Medicare crazy,``

443
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,504
Hey, you gotta pull yourself together here,

444
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:18,139
I know, I know, I`m sorry, I`m sorry,

445
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,308
Okay, I`II calm down,

446
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,785
Excuse me, but is that alcohol?

447
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:30,488
``Excuse me, but is that alcohol?``
Yes! Yes, it`s alcohol,

448
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,496
I`d Iike to see anybody do this sober,

449
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:39,435
Well, someone will do it sober
because you`re fired,

450
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:51,340
Ladies, I have some
potentially good news, really,

451
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:55,377
-It seems that Roger,,,
-We know, dear, We heard, Fired,

452
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,680
-I have an idea, though,
-It`s all our idea,

453
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:01,782
No, it wasn`t, It was my idea,
I brought it up and you agreed,

454
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,624
-Don`t you remember?
-No, It was my idea, I was the,,,

455
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,891
-It was not,
-Okay, okay, What`s the idea?

456
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,224
We want you to direct the special,

457
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:14,895
Me? No, That`s sweet,
but I make documentaries,

458
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,703
No, Don`t put yourself down,

459
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,007
-It`s in your blood, dear,
-My blood? I`m adopted,

460
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,139
Wesley, you`re Iike my children,
You were raised on movie sets,

461
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,649
I breastfed the twins during dailies,

462
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,745
It was sickening, And besides, we
never Iisten to the director anyway,

463
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,791
-We know what you do with the director,
-What I do with the director?

464
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,759
-Well, Iook who`s talking,
-Now, Iadies, Dignity! Dignity!

465
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:39,888
-Manners,
-That`s right, So it`s settled,

466
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,362
-You`II direct, Onward and upward,
-But,,,

467
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,023
There,

468
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,529
We have,,,

469
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:47,662
-Right,
-Who has the first Iine?

470
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,434
-Me,
-No, I,,,

471
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,110
You fall for any old Iine?

472
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,672
What are you, a moron?
God! Who am I asking?

473
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:04,848
Everybody knows Roger`s a drunk, okay?
But at Ieast he`s a semi-successful director,

474
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:09,724
You`re not even a semi-successful producer,
You, forgive me for saying, are a son,

475
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,261
Gavin, I could do this,

476
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,823
AII righty, then,
Now there`s two things you can screw up

477
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,423
producing and directing,

478
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,834
-Thank you for your support,
-You want support? Get a training bra,

479
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,130
You better make this work,
You better make this work, Westbourne,

480
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:26,836
or you and your career are gonna be Iike
President McKinsey`s wife, Dead and buried,

481
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:29,471
-McKinley,
-I said that,

482
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:44,357
-Those actresses are so self-involved,
-Mother, you`re an actress,

483
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,226
You forget I wrote a book,

484
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,198
Yeah, An autobiography called Me, Me, Me.

485
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:52,430
Well, sometimes you don`t even act
Iike you`re my son, Wesley,

486
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,937
Well, sometimes you don`t even act
Iike you`re my mother,

487
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,998
Come on,
I`ve given you everything a child could want,

488
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,442
Toys, Iove, publicity,

489
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,876
Listen, tomorrow morning I`m gonna
be a Iittle bit Iate

490
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:10,386
because I have a power peel
and a bikini wax,

491
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:15,848
Give me a kiss, Thank you,

492
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,428
Wesley, give me that costume.
I want the red one, not the green one.

493
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,398
Wake up, You`re having a nightmare,

494
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,197
You promised me great costumes.
This is too tight.

495
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,695
Connie,

496
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,734
God, it was so horrible,

497
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:38,575
It was so real, It was my mother and Addie
and Piper and they were

498
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:43,746
this hideous fire-breathing, three-headed
gargoyle monster who wanted to talk to me

499
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:47,313
about the show
and who had the most fabulous costumes,

500
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,791
and I can`t do this,

501
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,355
What`s really going on?

502
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:56,196
I just think people are gonna say that
I`m setting up housekeeping

503
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,757
in my mother`s shadow,

504
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:01,105
-Why?
-Connie, when I was growing up,

505
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,664
I just wanted to fit in,
and after years of struggling

506
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:09,338
I finally do get to a place where I could
succeed or I could fail on my own terms,

507
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:14,875
and now I`m right back at a place
that I just don`t wanna be at,

508
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:20,614
Kate Westbourne`s son, And if I do fail
at this, I`m just gonna be known as,

509
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,254
``What`s his name?
Kate Westbourne`s Ioser son,``

510
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,886
That`s ridiculous,

511
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:30,730
You`re helping your mother financially
and you`re gonna get your series on the air,

512
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:35,102
-Even your mother will respect that,
-Let me put this in a way you`II understand,

513
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:40,073
Not a chance,
My mother will never respect me,

514
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,738
You`re expecting her to behave
Iike a human being,

515
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:47,241
You`re forgetting one thing
that she never forgets, She is a star,

516
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:49,975
Pete, take it,

517
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,584
Okay, Iadies, It`s just the three of you today,
No boys,

518
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,360
Everybody, we`re gonna face front
towards the mirrors,

519
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,831
Now, I put marks down for rehearsal,

520
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,094
Piper, front and right, Addie, front and Ieft,

521
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,867
-And Kate, center back,
-No, no, I want to be in the center front,

522
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,067
because I`m tallest,

523
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,973
Since I`m the youngest,
I should be in the center,

524
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:16,810
Welcome to the Land of Delusion,
Population: both of you,

525
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:22,751
Ladies, Iadies, could we just try this
Pete`s way for now? PIease,

526
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:24,818
-Okay,
-Okay,

527
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:25,878
Good,

528
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:32,653
Okay, Iadies, Point shoulder up, down,
Rudy, take it from the top of Boy Crazy.

529
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:40,570
I... I like the way that they dance
I"m boy crazy

530
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,766
-I... I like...
-Piper, Piper, Piper, We`re not singing today,

531
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,969
No, it`s just a dance rehearsal,
But you know what?

532
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:50,241
That does remind me,
When we do sing these songs,

533
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:54,250
back from our younger days,
maybe we could frame them,

534
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,515
you know, with a nice Iittle intro,
something along the Iines of,

535
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:03,288
``Remember way back when?``
Or, ``Say, here`s a trip down memory Iane,``

536
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,625
Okay? Let`s try that, shall we? Super,

537
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:14,267
Okay, Iadies, Let me show you from the top,
AII right?

538
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,205
Five, six, seven, eight,
Toe point, toe to drop,

539
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,176
-Step, flick, step, down, turn and step,
-Wait a minute, You`re going too fast,

540
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,472
-Step, kick, down, step,
-How can we get this?

541
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,537
-Now, wait a minute,
-Reach and step, Reach and turn,

542
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,104
Reach, turn, Hip, Ball change,

543
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,810
-Step, reach and pop,
-Wonderful,

544
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,580
I`d have an easier time typing
that than dancing it,

545
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:32,316
Ladies, Iadies, we are on the right track,

546
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,448
-Sure,
-Whose track?

547
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,583
Look, we`II break it down,

548
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,127
Here we go, Iadies, Here we go,

549
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,129
-Five, six, seven,,,
-Wait a minute, Wait, wait, wait,

550
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,099
-Wait a minute,
-,,,eight, Toe, point, shoulder, down,

551
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:47,103
Reach, Swing, Swing that Ieg out,
Swing the Ieg out,

552
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,275
If you spent more time practicing your steps

553
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,437
-instead of that phony accent,
-Get away from me, Stop it!

554
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,310
Ladies, Iet me help you up,

555
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,712
I`II get up myself,

556
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:02,981
And she kicked me
with that great big green Ieg of hers,

557
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,954
Ladies, Ladies, please,

558
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,481
Shut up!

559
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:20,602
-What is it you want?
-I need to talk to Ms, Holden, privately,

560
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:24,738
-Why?
-I mean, it just concerns you, privately,

561
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,538
-Me?
-AII right,

562
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,341
-Come on,
-Just make it quick,

563
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,979
-Can we work?
-And forget the turn!

564
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:35,409
-Okay, thank you,
-Five, six, seven and point,

565
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:42,285
-What? Oh, my God,
-What?

566
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:46,056
-What`s the matter?
-It`s my boyfriend, Tony,

567
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,961
He`s had a heart attack in jail and,,,

568
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,660
And what? PIease, God,
make this a tiny ``and,``

569
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,863
Well, he has a Iittle heart condition
and so they put him in an ambulance

570
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:59,877
and took him off to the hospital and
somehow or another, en route, he escaped,

571
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,903
Oh, my God, Is he dangerous?
Are the two of you on good terms?

572
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:07,815
Tony`s not dangerous, He adores me,
No, he would never do anything to hurt me,

573
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:11,343
And besides, he`s an old man
with a heart attack, What can he do?

574
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,219
Come on, Iet`s get back to the number,

575
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,885
Wait, wait, We have to do something,
Increase security or,,,

576
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,192
No, she`s right, Let`s go back to work,
I need to stretch my Iegs,

577
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:25,702
Let`s not have anyone talk of heart attacks
and jail, Let`s have music and joy,

578
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,397
AII right, Let`s play some piano,

579
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:31,100
Here we go, from the top,
Five, six, seven and step,

580
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,837
shoulder, up, down, flick,,,

581
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:38,243
Hey, Iook, If I had her waiting for me,
I`d break out of prison, too,

582
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,546
I mean, Iook at this girl,
That`s one good Iooking Iady,

583
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:44,247
Gavin, I may be mistaken, but

584
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,553
I think she was very much alive
at the start of World War II,

585
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:52,358
Yeah? And I would Iove to have
gotten in the trenches with her, Look at that,

586
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,863
God, you need help,

587
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,157
I mean, so what? So she`s got
a few years on me, You know what?

588
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:01,500
I Iike those years on me, Yeah, Come on,

589
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,735
Look, this is the first break we`ve had,
It`s getting us tons of publicity,

590
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,869
The phones are ringing off the hook,
I`m proud of you, now get out of here,

591
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,650
Cheryl, send Addie some flowers,
And write a note,

592
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:17,654
And Iet`s give it a personal touch,
``Sorry about your boyfriend,

593
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:21,249
``BIah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, With Iove,``

594
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,027
And hold all calls,

595
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,245
-Room service for Ms, Holden,
-Could you turn around please?

596
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,712
Put your arms out,

597
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,447
-Who is it?
-Room service,

598
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,421
-I didn`t order room service,
-It`s courtesy of the production office,

599
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:58,558
How nice,

600
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,190
-There you go,
-Thank you,

601
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,702
Cannolis, My favorite,

602
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,276
-Help me out of this thing!
-Tony! Oh, my God,

603
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,220
Tony, you scared me to death,
Are you crazy?

604
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,490
Ms, Holden, are you okay in there?

605
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:33,426
Yes, Officer, Everything`s fine,
I tripped over my makeup mirror cord

606
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,523
and it smashed, But I`m fine,
Keep up the good work,

607
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,862
Okay,

608
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:41,096
You should not be here, This is the
first place they`II expect you to come,

609
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,367
So what? I mean, what are they gonna
give me? Life in prison?

610
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:47,343
I`m scared, I`II tell you the worst thing
that can happen to me,

611
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,977
I heard you were doing another show,

612
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,973
I got very upset,

613
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:57,744
I had a heart attack,
I mean, didn`t we have an agreement

614
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,586
that you weren`t gonna do no more shows?

615
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:06,563
Yes, Tony, we did, Tony, you know
I adore you and you give me everything,

616
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:11,658
but I was Ionely for my fans and, Iet`s face it,

617
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:15,536
you wouldn`t have wanted me
if you hadn`t seen me perform,

618
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:19,804
Well, here I am, So you can perform for me,

619
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:24,875
Where am I supposed to hide you?
I`m harboring a criminal,

620
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:30,984
Well, harbor me good, babe, because
this boat hasn`t been docked in years,

621
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,554
Why must you always be so vulgar?

622
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,858
You Iove it, and I`m born to be, right?

623
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:45,892
-You remember the time,,,
-Yes,

624
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,369
-Yeah, that was great,
-Get down there,

625
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:57,844
So you`re gonna start right there,

626
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:02,942
Good on the dive, Sharper, And turn,
Whack, whack, Good, Good,

627
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,386
Connie, remind me I gotta talk to Nolan

628
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,617
-Good morning, everybody,
-Good morning,

629
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,489
Good morning, you Iovely, Iovely Iadies,

630
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:13,828
-What are you so chipper about?
-Well, why shouldn`t I be chipper?

631
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:18,392
The sky is blue, traffic is Iight,
my hips are tiny

632
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,932
and I`m working again
with such good friends,

633
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,679
-You`re hiding Tony in your room,
-Who?

634
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:40,590
Come off it, When a woman is cheerful
and has a hickey on her neck,

635
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,749
there`s a man behind it,

636
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:48,961
AII right, I am hiding him,
But don`t tell anyone, please,

637
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,396
You can`t do that, you know,
It`s aiding and abetting,

638
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:55,802
Yes, You`re housing a criminal,
which is a crime,

639
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,136
and crime is against the Iaw,

640
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:04,843
Let me just have him for a Iittle while Ionger,
I`m having multiples,

641
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,814
It`s absolutely amazing,
This man can go for hours,

642
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:14,517
It`s some sort of tantric thing
they Iearn in jail,

643
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,721
-You`d Iove it,
-What if you get caught?

644
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:24,761
Look, just one more night,
Any more and I can`t take it,

645
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:29,329
Look, if you asked me to hide your boyfriend
who`d just broken out of jail,

646
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:32,864
I`d do it for you, And you,

647
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,172
-Multiples?
-Tantric?

648
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:40,472
Tantric,,,

649
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:59,465
Tony, that was so incredible,

650
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,771
Bet you never got anything Iike that
in jail, huh?

651
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:13,778
You were never anybody`s girl,
were you, Tony?

652
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,613
You don`t have to answer that,

653
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:24,922
So, does Big Tony wanna come out
and play again?

654
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,031
Round number four, Tony?

655
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:32,524
Tony?

656
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:35,894
Tony!

657
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,507
-Addie, what is it?
-What?

658
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:46,015
-It`s Tony, I think he`s,,,
-Having an extended senior moment,

659
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,175
Very rude?

660
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:51,950
No, no, I think I shtupped him to death!

661
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:57,221
Dear, you did the right thing,
I`m sure that`s what he would have wanted,

662
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,965
Yeah, He`s gone,

663
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:09,498
But don`t be upset at it,
because death is never the end,

664
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,232
It`s the beginning of a new incarnation,

665
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:17,110
Yes, You know, that`s true,
Bill is always asking me to boff him to death,

666
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,981
I know you`re upset, but would you have
the decency to cover the man?

667
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,419
It is not one of my goals in Iife
to see a dead mobster`s butt,

668
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:28,822
We have got to get rid of this body,
This is very incriminating,

669
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:34,387
This could create all kinds of negative
publicity for me, and the show, of course,

670
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:37,332
Well, no offense,
but he`s a dead weight now,

671
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,198
And how do you suggest we do that?

672
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:43,467
I don`t know,
At Ieast Iet`s get him off the bed!

673
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,337
-Well, Iet`s do it together,
-Let`s roll him off,

674
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,876
On the count of three,,,

675
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,504
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

676
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:56,847
Addie Sue? Are you all right, honey?
I thought that I heard,,,

677
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:01,218
-Addie Sue?
-Quiet!

678
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:05,686
Yes, Mummy, Tony`s dead,

679
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:10,826
I`m amazed that he Iived this Iong,
What I`m reacting to is the size of his,,,

680
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,835
If you must know, his jumbo,

681
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,064
No wonder you stayed with him so Iong,

682
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:18,734
Is rigor mortis setting in?
Or was he always Iike that?

683
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,277
Okay, okay, put a sock in it!

684
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,779
I`m having a heck of a time
hearing myself think here!

685
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,644
What happened to your accent?

686
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,947
You see, you rattle her enough,
she can talk just Iike you and me,

687
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,987
Shut your trap, Ma,

688
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:35,514
Ladies, Iet us think, precisely and concisely,

689
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:40,319
-Right, Mummy, give me your robe,
-But why my robe?

690
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:43,525
I`m certainly not gonna wear it again
after that`s brushed up against it,

691
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,534
I`II buy you another robe, Mummy,

692
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:48,833
Come on, where`s the pioneer spirit
that got us out of Kansas?

693
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:51,636
So what`s the idea
after we get him into the robe?

694
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:55,667
Well, I think that we should create
some sort of a diversion,

695
00:46:55,746 --> 00:47:00,740
and then we`II carry his body outside
and Ieave it somewhere casually,

696
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,809
-Where? With the bellboy?
-Poolside,

697
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:05,684
-In the gift shop?
-I just want him out of my room, okay?

698
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:09,954
Spare us! Spare us the drama, Addie,
Put the robe on him,

699
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:13,326
Why don`t we all do it together,
for old times` sake?

700
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:16,525
Oh, God, my memory is so hazy, Addie Sue,

701
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,661
I just don`t remember an old time
Iike that particularly,

702
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,331
-Push him up,
-Heavy for a Iittle guy,

703
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,807
If you don`t know what to do,
don`t push him towards me, He`s too heavy!

704
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:27,673
-Put his arm in the robe,
-I can`t get it in,

705
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:28,972
-He`s just gonna fall over,
-Put it in,

706
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,014
AII right, I`II hold,,,

707
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,109
Oh, God!

708
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,611
Get him off me, He`s poking me!

709
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:41,391
-Is everything all right in there?
-Yes, Officer, Everything`s fine,

710
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,256
Everything`s fine in here, Mr, Policeman,

711
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:50,800
I don`t think you should Ieave
my robe over that, It Iooks Iike a teepee,

712
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:56,663
-I wouldn`t touch that with a ten foot pole,
-It is a ten foot pole,

713
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:01,035
-Thank you,
-Ma`am,

714
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,184
Fire!

715
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,583
-Remain calm! Remain calm! Take the stairs,
-Take the stairs, Follow me,

716
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:17,286
Stay away from the elevators, Take the stairs
and stay away from the elevator,

717
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,366
You need a waxing,

718
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,235
This way,

719
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,636
-Ms, Holden, Aren`t you Addie Holden?
-No!

720
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:48,254
Heave him over, Just put him in the chair,
Try to put him in the chair,

721
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:51,852
-Here, grab a Ieg, grab a Ieg,
-Grab anything,

722
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,892
Call 911,

723
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:04,972
Tony! Goodbye, Tony, my Iove,
And my very best,

724
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,976
You were the best I ever had, darling,

725
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:11,105
Oh, God, Spare us, Grieve in your room,
Addie, please, this is ridiculous,

726
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,672
-Go upstairs!
-AII right,

727
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:18,118
Good Iuck in your new incarnation,
Perhaps I`II see you there,

728
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,251
God rest your soul,
Let`s get the hell out of here,

729
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:29,290
Did you notice how tiny his feet were?
I guess that old adage doesn`t ring true,

730
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,096
-Big nose, big,,,
-Don`t you dare!

731
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,160
-Excuse us!
-Excuse me,

732
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,267
Arrivederci, Tony

733
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,883
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

734
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,687
Yeah?

735
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,196
There they are,

736
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,198
A senior citizen`s arrest,

737
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,699
I get final approval of all these pictures!

738
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,806
Didn`t anyone ever tell you
that a woman should be Iit from below?

739
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:19,209
Wait! No!

740
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,683
There`s no filter on that Iens,
and I`m always shot from the Ieft!

741
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,952
Thanks, boys,
This will make a swell Christmas card,

742
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:39,432
Get them,

743
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,401
I bet they haven`t had any in years,

744
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,873
She`s had quite a bit very, very recently,

745
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:49,639
-Just screwed a man to death,
-I did not,

746
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:55,242
-Maybe I did,
-Mom?

747
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,651
-Wesley,
-Honey? Honey!

748
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,655
-My baby!
-Addie?

749
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,853
-Oh, my God, Iook at,,,
-Addie, Addie!

750
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,392
-We were just,,,
-Laurie Miller, KRTW,

751
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,870
-Can you tell us what happened?
-Yes, It`s really very simple, The,,,

752
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:19,841
The deceased, Mr, Marshall,
he broke into my room, and

753
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:24,040
he tried to force himself onto me,
and when I resisted he died

754
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:29,074
and so him being nude and all, we slipped
him into my mother, Mrs, Hodges,,,

755
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:34,385
-No, not into me, into my robe,
-We slipped him into my mother`s robe,

756
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:38,656
for the sake of common decency,
and then the wastepaper basket

757
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:41,891
caught fire and so we took him
down to the Iobby,

758
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:44,598
-That`s it, That`s all,
-End of story,

759
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:48,566
Well, it is a sympathetic piece,

760
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:54,008
Sympathetic to you, maybe, but we Iook
Iike chorus girls in your sordid Iittle tragedy,

761
00:51:54,077 --> 00:52:00,414
It is not a Iittle tragedy, Kate,
The man Iiterally died on top of me,

762
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:04,412
Isn`t that what most men want?
To die in the saddle?

763
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:08,382
-It is not that great for the saddle,
-No?

764
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:12,519
-Okay, Let`s do this, Rehearsal`s up,
-Fascinating Rhythm.

765
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,594
Yes, absolutely,

766
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,159
Hi, boys,

767
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:20,795
-Hello! Hello, hello,
-Hi, girls,

768
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,434
Ready? Music,

769
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,172
Five, six, seven, eight,

770
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:38,184
Dipsy doodle, It was all my fault,

771
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,723
No, no, no, no, It was all mine,
I bumped into you, I`m so sorry,

772
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:43,315
-Hello, hello, hello,
-It was my fault, I bumped into you,

773
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:46,089
Okay, Hello, Follow me,

774
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,461
-Okay,
-You ready? Music,

775
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,594
Five, six, seven and,,,

776
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,539
-Kate! Addie!
-Piper, please!

777
00:52:57,607 --> 00:53:02,271
Listen, Listen, Iisten, Iisten,
I have,,, I have made my statement

778
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,803
about Mr, Frank at the press conference
Iast night and that is all I have to say,

779
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,146
-You just Ieave her dead mobster alone!
-Right,

780
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,413
-He`s crossed over,
-Piper, what do you have to say

781
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:14,446
about reports speculating that there was
mob involvement in the fire at your hotel?

782
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:18,216
-What fire at my hotel?
-Ma`am, it`s blazing out of control,

783
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:23,122
What? Are you sure?
Well, it`s never done that before,

784
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,360
-Bill, did you hear that?
-Well, yeah, it`s,,,

785
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,426
-What does that mean?
-It`s okay, It`II be all right, Yeah,

786
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:30,996
-What are you saying, it`s all right?
-But apparently, it`s not all right,

787
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:35,067
The Grayson Casino and Hotel
is still in flames after firefighters

788
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:41,106
-barely had time to evacuate,
-My mother warned me, Never trust a man!

789
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,547
-No fire insurance!
-Listen, honey I,,,

790
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:48,022
You would think, with a name Iike Bill,
you`d know how to pay one!

791
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,888
-No touching. No touching.
-Please. Come on.

792
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,191
No, no, no.
You can"t be that stupid enough...

793
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:58,800
This is a delight!
You couldn`t pay for that kind of publicity,

794
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,766
Gavin, don`t you think this is gonna be a bit
of a setback for Piper?

795
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:05,103
They had to sedate her and everything,

796
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,666
Cheryl, Look, I can`t help it
if that Iame-o husband of hers

797
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,974
didn`t renew their fire insurance, Cheryl!

798
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:13,243
FIowers to Piper, ``Sorry about your hotel,

799
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:14,874
``One door closes, another one opens,

800
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:17,613
``BIah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
Sincerely,``

801
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:22,617
-You want your name on the card?
-No! Yeah, sure if there`s room put it on,

802
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:24,759
But put ``Iove,`` ``Love, Wes,``

803
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,858
-Still in the doghouse?
-Yeah, I guess so,

804
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,996
-Feeling blue?
-Yeah, kind of,

805
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:39,737
Well, it wasn`t your fault, you know,

806
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:44,179
-Tell Mama, Tell Mama all, huh?
-Why?

807
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:48,644
Poor Iittle Bill, so sad, so blue,

808
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:52,518
His wife`s a Girl Scout, Such bad wigs, too,

809
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,023
Is my boy Bill
in the naughty husband house?

810
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:58,151
Yes, Yes,

811
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,196
You know, I`ve always found you
very attractive, Bill,

812
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:03,494
-Addie, I`m,,,
-I`m sure you`d Iike to relax a bit,

813
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,763
Pick up, pick up, pick up,

814
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,493
Pick up,,,

815
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:12,507
Piper! Are you awake? Well, get awake,
I know, I know,

816
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:15,908
Shut up and Iisten to me for a minute,
Get the hell out of bed,,,

817
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,806
Yeah, yeah, you heard me, If you don`t,
Addie`s gonna seduce your husband,

818
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:22,579
just Iike she seduced Dick behind my back,

819
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,142
-,,,Iike martinis?
-I do,

820
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,687
-Peach martinis?
-No,

821
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,780
-What kind of,,,
-Bill?

822
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:33,084
Honey, I`ve been thinking,
I didn`t Iike that old hotel

823
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:37,429
and we shouldn`t Iet anything
get in the way of us,

824
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:43,097
Particularly not some cheap, tacky,
Iiposuctioned, talentless, off-key,

825
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:48,236
old-bit building,
with Iiver spots all over its arms,

826
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:55,412
Honey, can Bill, Jr, come out
and play the magic flute for Iittle Piper?

827
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:01,115
We don`t need a hotel,
We just need a hotel room,

828
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,592
-You don`t have to ask me twice, baby,
-I Iove you,

829
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:14,027
With make-up as thick as clotted cream

830
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:17,039
No you"re not a clown, you"re a drag queen

831
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:23,776
Well, if I`ve got the make-up
of a drag queen, you`ve got the shoulders,

832
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:28,177
-Hi,
-Hi, Hello,

833
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:31,982
-Morning,
-Hello, Hello, Hi, Hi,

834
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:37,156
The network brass and, more importantly,
the major sponsors are here

835
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,285
-for the run-through,
-Right,

836
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:42,695
So, Iet me see, How can I put this?
What`s that word again?

837
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,865
I see, Yeah, This better not suck, okay?

838
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:49,067
-Whatever happened to ``break a Ieg``?
-I need this to be good,

839
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,664
I got advertisers coming out of my keester,

840
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:56,303
-You should have that Iooked at,
-Somebody`s growing a backbone,

841
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,181
Break a Ieg,

842
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:04,752
And now, Iadies and gentlemen,
may I present the very first run-through

843
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,449
of our salute to Boy Crazy?

844
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:11,382
PIayback,

845
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:18,191
I like the boys in summer

846
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:21,269
And in the fall, same thing

847
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:25,135
And when the winter"s cold wind blows

848
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:29,376
What better way to warm your toes?

849
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,779
"Cause even in the wildest snow

850
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,544
Snow, Cue snow,

851
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,347
They always make it spring

852
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:38,814
Where`s the snow?

853
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,658
I... I like the way that they dance

854
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:46,787
I"m boy crazy

855
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,084
Get away from me!

856
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:27,429
This is not what we rehearsed,

857
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:47,587
That`s great, Hey, it`s good news,
Really, the doctor told me that

858
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:51,457
Piper will cough up acrylic snow
for a Iittle bit, but that`s it,

859
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,359
The flakes are completely out
of Addie`s eyes,

860
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:56,557
So her right cornea is a Iittle scratched,
Her vision will be a Iittle blurry,

861
00:58:56,633 --> 00:59:00,467
And my mom`s just being treated
for minor abrasions, It`s fine,

862
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,630
Yeah, I don`t know
if we`re gonna be able to do this,

863
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,797
-No?
-It`s a mess,

864
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:07,331
Yeah, You can`t start the show
with that number, It`s a train wreck,

865
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,004
You know, Wesley,
I`d say you were a disappointment,

866
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,604
but that would imply that I expected more
from you, Hold on a second,

867
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:15,617
I just thought of something,
Can you detail cars?

868
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:18,620
Do you ever get tired of being
such a maggot?

869
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:23,114
No, I Iove it,
We`re on the air with this thing in two days,

870
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:27,356
I`II see you in your trailer ASAP,
Thank you, Iadies, Great effort,

871
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:34,836
Aye, aye, matey, Wesley, Wesley,
please don`t be depressed,

872
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:39,034
Everything`s gonna be fine,
These things have a way of working out,

873
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:44,544
Did I ever tell you that you remind me
of that great director, Billy Wilder?

874
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:45,842
Addie, no,

875
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:50,818
Well, I just want to thank you
for bringing joy back into my Iife,

876
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:55,922
And giving me faith again
in the power of entertainment,

877
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:06,424
-Thank you,
-You`re very welcome,

878
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:18,709
Mother, Mother, wait up,

879
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,908
Mother, Kate,

880
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:26,354
Billy? It`s Billy Wilder, for goodness`s sakes!
I didn`t recognize you

881
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,414
without your star of choice,
Addie, the suck-up,

882
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:32,859
-PIease, She was just being nice,
-``Being nice,``

883
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:36,123
What you call being nice,
I call blowing smoke up your butt,

884
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:39,828
AII she wants is to get the best shots
in the special, Wesley,

885
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:44,030
God forbid you treated me a Iittle better,
I am having a bad enough day as it is,

886
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:47,270
-I really don`t need any more grief,
-I`m just trying to protect you,

887
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:51,473
She did the same thing with Dick Preston
on the movie in the first place,

888
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:55,816
For Pete`s sake,
Stop being such a control freak,

889
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:58,786
-Act Iike a mother,
-What would you know about mothering?

890
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:01,619
-You`re just feeding his ego,
-What ego?

891
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:03,420
You squashed that down years ago,

892
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,927
You`re just jealous
because you don`t have a son,

893
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:10,227
AII you`ve ever had are boyfriends,
And now that you`ve killed the Iast one,

894
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:13,791
you`re finally realizing
that family is everything,

895
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:17,135
And since it`s much too Iate
for you to ever start one of your own,

896
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:18,639
you`re trying to steal mine,

897
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,369
I don`t want to steal your precious son,

898
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,640
AIthough it wouldn`t be too difficult,
considering how you treat him,

899
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:27,308
At Ieast I know how to be charming
to people and I`m younger

900
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:28,816
and better Iooking than you,

901
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:34,016
Darling, you were stealing husbands
Iong before I was born,

902
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,387
-Really?
-Really,

903
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:39,519
Well, if you`re so stunning, with all those
Iiver spots that you call freckles,

904
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:43,497
how come Dick Ieft you for me, huh?
And you wouldn`t Iook quite so cutesy pie

905
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:46,296
-without that stupid wig!
-Stop it,

906
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,701
Leave me alone, you skinny Iittle mutant!

907
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:54,406
And Dick Preston did not Ieave me,
He sensed that I was going to Ieave,

908
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:57,139
and he Ieft first in order to save face,

909
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:01,579
Well, you`ve never been able to face
what really happened,

910
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:04,085
You have never been able to face anything,

911
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,353
And what is that supposed to mean?

912
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:11,791
Let me tell you something
that you have never faced,

913
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:16,628
Wesley bats for the other team,

914
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,367
And I don`t mean baseball,

915
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:21,960
What the hell are you talking about?

916
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,432
Kate, your son is gay,

917
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,507
That is ridiculous,

918
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,616
No, What is ridiculous
is that you have never noticed,

919
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,649
-Did Wesley tell you this?
-Wesley didn`t have to tell me that,

920
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,451
Anyone with an ounce of sensitivity
can see it,

921
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,060
-Where are you going?
-To Wesley,

922
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:49,522
Don`t tell him I told you,

923
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:52,891
-Kiss ass,
-SIag,

924
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:55,563
That was not a run-through, Okay?
No, no, Actually, that was a stampede,

925
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:59,506
No, a stampede would require a real director,
You couldn`t direct traffic, you know that?

926
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:01,707
You can`t even,,, What?

927
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,077
-It`s Wesley`s mother,
-Busy, Mother,

928
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:08,009
-No, it`s important,
-In a meeting,

929
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:12,248
Wesley, what could possibly be so,,, Gavin,

930
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:15,620
Hello, boys, We need to talk,

931
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:19,183
-What do you want, Mother?
-What? Do I have to want something?

932
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:23,392
Isn`t it all right if I just want to come
and talk to my talented son?

933
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,934
If you are complimenting me,
you want something,

934
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:29,904
Well, you are doing a fantastic job, dear,
You are,

935
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:33,874
-We all are,
-This must really be important,

936
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:37,242
-Is one of us dying?
-No!

937
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,851
But apparently one of us is gay,

938
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,395
And who told you that?

939
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:03,837
Wesley, I think it`s wonderful, dear,

940
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:08,600
You know, being in show business,
I`ve been around gay people all my Iife,

941
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:13,541
I sensed it, A mother knows these things,

942
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:18,977
AII right, Addie told me,

943
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,557
But I am your mother,

944
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:29,053
-I know, Can I get back to work now?
-No, I mean it,

945
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,362
I am your mother,

946
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:40,335
You`re obviously driving at something here
and you are so good at being blunt,

947
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:43,435
So why don`t you just come out and say it,
so I can go back in there

948
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:46,504
-and get yelled at some more? Okay?
-I said it,

949
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,079
I am your mother,

950
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:52,518
-And?
-And,,,

951
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:56,158
Dick Preston was your father,

952
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:04,659
What are you saying?

953
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:08,166
My dear, I don`t know how many other ways
I can say this,

954
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:15,740
You are actually my son,
You are actually the son of Dick Preston,

955
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:19,542
We had you together, Do you understand?

956
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:25,148
And you`re gay
and we`ve all had our Iittle secrets,

957
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:30,754
-You are saying that I`m not adopted?
-That`s right,

958
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:36,430
You`re saying that Dick Preston
was my father?

959
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:37,830
Right,

960
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:41,233
And that you are,,,

961
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:43,605
Your mother,

962
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,335
And you`re telling me all of this now

963
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:51,640
to get back at me for not telling you

964
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:55,411
that I was gay? Or because Addie told you?

965
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,816
No, Don`t you,,, PIease don`t get upset,

966
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:01,118
Don`t get upset? Why would I get upset?
You wait half of my Iife

967
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,818
to tell me that I am not adopted

968
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:07,693
and that you are my actual,

969
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:10,357
real birth mother

970
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:16,269
and that Dick Preston was my father,,,
And he`s dead now!

971
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,171
``I`m sorry, I forgot to mention you do have
a father, but you don`t really have a father

972
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:24,576
``because your father is dead!
Don`t get upset!``

973
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:27,879
Wesley! Come on, now,

974
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:31,111
I`m gonna go to my meeting now,

975
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:35,180
This is no time to,,, Wesley! Wesley!

976
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:40,087
Dear, dear, dear, dear, stop shrieking,
You`II ruin your vocal cords,

977
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,653
And besides that, everyone will hear,

978
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:49,335
Well, I certainly heard,
So, Dick Preston fathered your child,

979
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:52,465
-You devious slut!
-Wesley`s Dick`s boy?

980
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:58,138
So you deprived Wesley of a father
all his Iife because he dumped you for me?

981
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:02,617
You are jealous because I had a child
with Dick Preston and all you had was sex,

982
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,346
I wish that in a previous Iife,

983
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,218
I had ripped out that vicious tongue
of yours and flung it in the fire,

984
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:11,259
PIease, we can`t go on Iike this,
We can`t go through all this again,

985
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:14,524
I can`t believe you two keep on mooning
about Dick Preston,

986
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:19,625
a man who`s been dead for years
and who, after all, had a freckled penis,

987
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:24,572
-What?
-How the hell would you know?

988
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:28,833
Yeah, well, I wouldn`t know,
I wouldn`t know,

989
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:31,106
That`s just something
that I heard, you know,

990
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:34,081
He slept with a Iot of people, you know,

991
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:38,018
Dick slept with women who had normal
sexual appetites,

992
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:40,851
Which you wouldn`t know anything about,
because you`re so frigid

993
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:44,654
-you probably never had an orgasm anyway,
-I am not frigid,

994
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:51,288
And I was having orgasms at the same time
you were, With Dick Preston, Satisfied?

995
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:54,867
You and Dick,

996
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:58,464
Pretending to be
that Iittle goody-two-shoes virgin

997
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:01,237
when you were just as big a whore
as we were,

998
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:04,643
Dick came to me after he was sick to death
of the two of you,

999
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:07,147
He needed to be around someone
with a Iittle class,

1000
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:11,243
-A Iittle is right, A very Iittle,
-Well, at Ieast I have some,

1001
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:15,780
-Which is more than you can say,
-You silly, dried-up bimbo!

1002
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:21,494
-I hate you! That is so,,,
-Stop that! Give me that!

1003
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:24,362
-Stop it, Quit it, Quit it,
-Don`t hit me!

1004
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:29,268
That is so,,, Stop it,
You made my child fatherless,

1005
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,602
Stop it, Stop it,

1006
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:34,734
Stop it, Stop it!

1007
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:38,707
Stop it! That`s it, That`s it,
Nothing is worth this,

1008
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,579
I`m pulling the plug on this sucker,
You`re all officially out of a job,

1009
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:46,178
Especially you, Tom, put on a rerun
of the Susan Lucci movie

1010
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:50,515
and release a statement to the press saying
that whatever talent these Iadies had,

1011
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:54,085
they`ve Iost, along with their minds,
and their Iooks, and my interest,

1012
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:56,256
-No, No,
-Thanks,

1013
01:08:56,398 --> 01:09:02,394
You know, the three of you are so bitter
about crap that happened so Iong ago,

1014
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,439
you don`t even realize
what was supposed to happen here,

1015
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:09,137
You`re the stars of a movie that the whole
country has fallen in Iove with again

1016
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:11,111
and you don`t even care!

1017
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:15,310
Boy Crazywas a movie about the joy
and the Iove that three friends could have

1018
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:19,047
for each other, and the three of you are just
the worst ambassador of that message

1019
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,351
that the world will ever know,

1020
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:24,823
Wesley! Dear heart! Love apple!

1021
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:32,732
Oh, my God,
I think she`s having a heart attack,

1022
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:36,567
-No, she`s crying, I think,
-Don`t be silly, I`ve never seen her cry,

1023
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:40,666
Me neither, But I remember hearing that she
tried that once in the Gregory Peck movie,

1024
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:43,541
and she had this slice of onion
to stick it in her eye and,,,

1025
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:47,844
PIease! I told Wesley that he was my real son

1026
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:50,442
in the most horrible and bizarre way,

1027
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:54,679
And now we`ve Iost our jobs
and he`s Iost his job and,,,

1028
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,917
God, he`II never speak to me again,

1029
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:58,892
There, there, you didn`t mean
to tell him in that way,

1030
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:01,555
No, No, no, you`re far too elegant for that,

1031
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:04,758
You would`ve sent him a perfumed note
or something,

1032
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:07,700
Yes, right, That`s right,
You know, I was thinking Iast night,

1033
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:11,536
you know, I was alone and I couldn`t sleep,
so I rented some of Wesley`s,,,

1034
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:15,703
Those presidential documentaries
about mothers, you know, famous mothers,

1035
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:19,009
And it struck me
that they`re always famous mothers Iike us,

1036
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:23,780
that they`re always very doting,
and they always put their families first,

1037
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:27,253
Piper, that is so profound,

1038
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:34,092
Oh, my God, Oh, my God, I see that now,
I`m seeing it so much more clearly,

1039
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:37,257
He needs me, That`s what he needs,

1040
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:41,335
It`s the truth, You know, sweetie,
I`ve had four children and you know what?

1041
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:45,069
-What?
-You can fix this thing with Wesley,

1042
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:54,342
No, No, Well, Iet me be clear, No,

1043
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,783
-We will take a salary cut,
-There`s nothing Ieft to cut,

1044
01:10:57,853 --> 01:11:00,947
Because you ate it all up in added expenses
with your custom gowns

1045
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:02,820
and your wig makers and your waxing,

1046
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:06,327
Well, in our days, those things
would have been picked up by the studio,

1047
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:10,231
Okay, Well, I guess you`ve
been too busy screaming at each other

1048
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:13,700
to realize that night has kind of fallen
on your day,

1049
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:16,099
Pithy, but rude,

1050
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:23,840
You know, Gavin, when you`re rude

1051
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:30,716
your eyes sparkle Iike a naughty Iittle boy,
and I want to hold you to my breast

1052
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:33,850
and sing you Irish Iullabies,,,

1053
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:40,351
Oh, Gavin boy
Your pipes, your pipes are calling

1054
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:48,160
Straight to my glen
And up the mountain stream

1055
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:55,769
AII right, Gavin, we are really, really sorry,

1056
01:11:56,378 --> 01:12:01,077
And we are never really, really sorry
about anything,

1057
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:05,578
We will be nice to people, You`II see,
You know, upbeat, Peppy,

1058
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:08,890
Peppy, Yeah, No, no and a big fat no,

1059
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:11,926
-But, Gavin, we Iove show business,
-It`s all we know,

1060
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:15,486
-And if we can`t perform, we will die,
-Yeah, And you`II be blamed,

1061
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:18,658
What we really want is just
one more moment in the sun,

1062
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,395
One more dance in the Iimelight,

1063
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:22,699
We can`t be ourselves
unless we`re in front of an audience,

1064
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:26,138
-That is exactly how I feel!
-Me, too!

1065
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:27,334
-Really?
-Really,

1066
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:30,139
-You didn`t tell me that,
-I Iove it!

1067
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:32,305
-It`s who we are,
-Come here,

1068
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,312
-Look what you`ve done,
-Yes, you did it,

1069
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:46,625
I have never heard Wesley so upset,

1070
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:50,529
When I told him the show was back on,
he still hung up on me,

1071
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,897
Will you relax? You`re gonna wreck my car,

1072
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:56,665
Just don`t worry about it, If we can convince
that awful Gavin fellow to do the show,

1073
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,401
-then Wesley`s a cinch,
-AII right,

1074
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:02,308
Hey, it`s Piper Grayson!
Check it, check it out, man,

1075
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,040
What`s your name, dear?

1076
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:32,206
-Sir, excuse me,
-Not now,

1077
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:33,707
Sir, Sir!

1078
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:36,734
-Got it,
-Hello,

1079
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:41,782
-Oh, no,
-Excuse me, excuse me, Attention please,

1080
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:48,186
Has anyone seen my son,
Wesley Westbourne?

1081
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:51,757
-Hide me,
-He`s over here!

1082
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:52,953
Judas,

1083
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:54,962
You`re gonna have to see her
sooner or Iater,

1084
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,895
I just,,, I wanna say hi,

1085
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:00,559

You remember me?

1089
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:11,036
You, Wesley,

1090
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,172
-Hi, Wesley,
-We`ve been Iooking for you everywhere,

1091
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:17,207
and we really had quite a time finding you,
What was the name of the place

1092
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,652
that we particularly Iiked called the,,,
The Toy Box,

1093
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,849
-No, she means the Tool Box,
-Yeah,

1094
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:25,223
So, could I talk with you please, Wesley?

1095
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,792
There`s so many people here,

1096
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:31,793
-Yeah!
-Hi!

1097
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:35,200
-Can you,,, Do something!
-Okay, okay,

1098
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,728
-Distract them! I don`t know,
-You ain`t seen nothing,,,

1099
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,365
-Come,
-What?

1100
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:43,343
-Hi, Kate,
-Hi, Kate,

1101
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,146
Thank you!

1102
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,152
That`s it,

1103
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:22,308
When I first found out I was going
to have a baby, I was so overjoyed,

1104
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:29,049
But, in those days, if you weren`t married
and you were pregnant, it was a scandal,

1105
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:32,719
And if you were a movie star,
your career was over,

1106
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:35,619
So, I wouldn`t have been able to afford you,

1107
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:40,458
So instead of giving you up for adoption,
I pretended to adopt you,

1108
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:44,400
I have to know, How did you pull this off?

1109
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:50,501
I went to Europe, I faked a phony illness,
Got Iots of fluffy, big clothes,

1110
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:57,151
And when I came back, I had this beautiful
baby boy from the Ukraine,

1111
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:00,853
And you never told me any of this because,,,

1112
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:14,399
,,,to adopt you, that`s why,

1113
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:35,413
Every time I try to get close to you, you run,

1114
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:40,650
Every day I meant to tell you,
And every day that I didn`t tell you,

1115
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:43,129
the not-telling-you got bigger,

1116
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:46,861
And you sensed
that I was holding something back,

1117
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:50,427
And that`s the way it became between us,

1118
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:56,171
So all those times you tried to tell me,
you just felt guilty,

1119
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:02,107
And when I felt guilty, I resented you,

1120
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,421
Wesley, I was wrong,

1121
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:16,025
And I can`t forgive myself
until you forgive me,

1122
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,125
PIease, son,

1123
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:25,005
AII right, I will forgive you,

1124
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,874
-Under one condition,
-Anything,

1125
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:31,406
I wanna hear you say, ``I was wrong,``

1126
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:33,878
One more time,

1127
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:46,692
I was wrong,

1128
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:52,226
-Now do me a favor, please?
-What`s that?

1129
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:54,129
Hug your mother,

1130
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,137
Okay,

1131
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:22,363
-Thank you, Ralph!
-Did he forgive you?

1132
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:23,557
Yes!

1133
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,099
Come on, guys,

1134
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:52,455
,,,this row, I need you to follow the spot
on the Iadies all the way down the stairs,

1135
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:55,291
And, Eric, for crying out Ioud,
you gotta fix these cracks in the stage,

1136
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:57,092
The Iadies are gonna trip,
They`re wearing heels,

1137
01:18:57,165 --> 01:19:00,032
Wesley, say hello to Mr, Stern,
the Chairman of the network,

1138
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:01,592
-Hello,
-How do you do?

1139
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:04,571
Kate and Piper are on their way,
I`m just gonna go Iook for Addie,

1140
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:08,006
When Gavin told me his idea
for the special, I was a Iittle skeptical,

1141
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:12,538
But then when the sponsors started
fighting for time, I changed my tune,

1142
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:16,243
Gas Go Bye Bye and Denture Grab,
Tinkle Pads,

1143
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:20,721
I told Gavin today,
he`s getting a huge bonus,

1144
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:24,218
Well, you must be so proud,

1145
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:28,528
-Here they are, Mr, Stern,
-Hello!

1146
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:32,033
-Two of our shining stars,
-Piper, Kate,

1147
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,536
-Hello,
-I am a huge fan,

1148
01:19:35,804 --> 01:19:39,968
And, Piper, I wanted to marry Tammy
Iike every other man in America,

1149
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:44,403
And, Kate, if there`s anything
to this past Iife thing,

1150
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:46,970
I sure hope that we were Iovers
in another Iife,

1151
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:49,175
I`m certain of it, You were Charlemagne,

1152
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:52,146
Well, thank you,

1153
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:55,815
And I still have the Playboy centerfold
that Addie did a few years ago,

1154
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:59,156
I`m sure she`d Iove to talk to you
about her spread,

1155
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,620
-I`II go get her, shall I?
-I`d Iike that,

1156
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:08,559
Forget your troubles
Come on, get Addie

1157
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:12,900
I"m gonna chase all your cares away

1158
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,205
And I was just starting to Iike you a Iittle,
Come on, Bill,

1159
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,872
Wait a minute,
You`ve got it all wrong, as usual,

1160
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:21,677
-Have I?
-Well, honey, her zipper got stuck, I,,,

1161
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,651
We`re going,
No show is worth Iosing your husband,

1162
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,550
Don`t be so melodramatic,

1163
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:29,681
You`ve had your eye on my Bill
ever since you killed your boyfriend

1164
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,385
with your Iethal genitals,

1165
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:34,257
He was just helping me unzip my dress,

1166
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:36,889
-We`re going,
-Well, honey, wait a minute, now,

1167
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:40,560
Lethal what? What does that mean?

1168
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:42,663
-Now Iisten to me,,,
-Piper,

1169
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:44,102
AII I did was walk past her door,,,

1170
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,037
I`m not gonna Iose
another husband to that hussie,

1171
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:47,233
She stuck her head out and said,

1172
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:48,833
-could I help her?
-We are Ieaving,

1173
01:20:57,118 --> 01:21:01,316
-Honey, Iisten to me,
-It was only my zipper,

1174
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:05,917
Wait! Wait!

1175
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:12,865
Gavin? Problem,

1176
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:19,005
Fix this, Or you`II be selling Tinkle Pads
door to door,

1177
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:33,754
A heart attack, I can`t believe it,

1178
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:37,849
Who cares what you believe, you tramp?
No wonder they call you the British Open,

1179
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:41,657
-Should have been her, she`s the oldest,
-By whose clock, prune face?

1180
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:47,032
-Pot calling kettle?
-Ladies, It`s a sad day for all of us,

1181
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:50,461
Beryl Mason has died,

1182
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:54,840
Oh, my God, Our agent!

1183
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:57,937
When she heard you walked off
the show, she had a heart attack,

1184
01:21:58,013 --> 01:22:02,382
Rose rushed her to the hospital and I
called you as soon as I heard the news,

1185
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,281
By the time we got here,
she was in intensive care

1186
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:09,551
-and she died in Wesley`s arms,
-Son,

1187
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:11,683
But before she died,

1188
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:16,823
she used every ounce of her strength
and she told us her Iast wish,

1189
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:22,564
Yeah, Yeah, she raised herself up
on her elbow and clasped his hand,,,

1190
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:24,571
-And then she said, I`II never forget this,
-Yeah,

1191
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,904
She said, ``You tell those divas

1192
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:31,477
``the show must go on,``

1193
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:36,708
What does this do to my karma?

1194
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:43,886
Just Iike a scene
from a Barbara Stanwyck movie,

1195
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:46,690
Then we`re murderers,

1196
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:54,031
-So what do you say?
-Well, Gavin, I`m in,

1197
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:57,097
I`m in if she apologizes,

1198
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:59,367
Who are we kidding? Let`s just do it,

1199
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:03,003
Let`s not have any more death,

1200
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:06,377
I`m sorry, Piper, I`m really sorry, Really,

1201
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,081
-It`s okay,
-Do you mean it?

1202
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,741
It`s okay,

1203
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:11,341
Truce,

1204
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:14,216
Truce,

1205
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:22,663
-To Beryl,

We`II see you in the next Iife, Beryl,

1208
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:30,997
Unless I see you first,

1209
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:36,537
-Thanks, Beryl,
-Wesley, you tricked us,

1210
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:40,576
-I am so proud of you!
-You bad boy!

1211
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:44,382
PIaces, people,

1212
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:45,544
-but we`re Iive in two minutes,

01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:47,946
-Break a Ieg, Iadies,

01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:50,680
Cue 17 and two counts. Go.

1215
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:52,624
-That`s my spot,
-Yep,

1216
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:56,994
Performers on stage. Places, dancers.
We"re live in 30 seconds.

1217
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:58,764
Role video playback.

1218
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:02,731
The girls are back, boys

1219
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:05,864
So stand aside

1220
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:10,000
We"ve been on a trip and it"s been

1221
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:14,879
One hell of a ride

1222
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:20,216
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the special reunion of

1223
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:24,054
Boy Crazy, The girls are back.

1224
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:29,626
First you"re down
and then you"re high again

1225
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:31,927
What a life

1226
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:35,531
Right back to the top and down again

1227
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:38,504
What a life

1228
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:43,010
Your best friend steals away your lover

1229
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:47,074
You meet somebody new

1230
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:49,878
You wouldn"t have found
if he"d been around

1231
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:52,913
You get trounced and then you win again

1232
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:56,089
What a life

1233
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:58,955
One big bounce then, boom
You"re in again

1234
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:02,327
What a life

1235
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:05,889
It"s all one big surprise

1236
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:09,996
Doors are open
Then they"re shut

1237
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:13,063
What a life

1238
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:20,377
First you"re prime
And then you"re chuck again

1239
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:22,882
What a life

1240
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:26,409
Nice things sag and need a tuck again

1241
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:29,184
What a life

1242
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:33,660
You watch your favorite dream go under

1243
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:37,790
Next day you start again

1244
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:40,926
And watch your balloon
Over the moon

1245
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:46,565
One day you"re so mad at friends
You could tear their hair

1246
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:50,172
Next day thirty years have passed and you

1247
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:53,078
Just don"t care

1248
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:57,244
In time we all get wise

1249
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:03,985
If they treat you like a nut
You just keep on kicking butt

1250
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:17,765
You are out then you"re back strutting it

1251
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:21,331
What a life

1252
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:26,137
Time goes by and still you"re cutting it

1253
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:30,406
What a life

1254
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:36,489
Just play it as it lies

1255
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:40,690
It can kick you in the gut

1256
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:44,863
It can trap you in a rut

1257
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:46,524
-It is...
-Crazy

1258
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:48,091
-Wacky
-Loony

1259
01:26:48,169 --> 01:26:49,158
Tacky

1260
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:54,598
But what a life

1261
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:57,645
What a life

1262
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:02,381
What a life

1263
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:07,144
What a fabulous life

1264
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:11,590
Yes!

1265
01:27:14,028 --> 01:27:15,017
Yeah!

1266
01:27:43,124 --> 01:27:46,093
We"re out to commercial.
We"re back live in three minutes.

1267
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:48,658
-Yeah, come on, come on, Beryl,
-Come, come, come,

1268
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:49,719
Come on,

1269
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:54,935
Get off your asses for these old broads!
