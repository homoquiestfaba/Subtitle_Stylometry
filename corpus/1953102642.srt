1
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:17,636
It's a form! What could be simpler?!
All you must do is fill in the blanks!

2
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:20,716
What do I have to do,
hire a nursemaid to hold your hand?

3
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:23,116
Put ribbons in your hair?!

4
00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:25,436
How many times must I tell you?!

5
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:29,596
If you want him down,
this is no huge problem.

6
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,316
You should be able
to fill out a form correctly!

7
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,556
And if you can't do that. . .

8
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:37,716
. . .then I'll just have to get
somebody who can.

9
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:41,836
I ain't going to ask you again!

10
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:44,916
Get back to your desk!

11
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,116
I was a good boy!

12
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:49,596
What's happening?

13
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:52,916
Well, well!
Why are you here?

14
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:55,076
Smelled business.

15
00:00:55,396 --> 00:00:56,796
Third bureaucrat this month.

16
00:01:03,756 --> 00:01:07,436
Enough of this shit. Tell Carl to
shoot him. He's fucking up traffic.

17
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:09,196
His name?

18
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,516
Jeffrey Brose, lnterstate
Commerce Commission. . .

19
00:01:13,756 --> 00:01:15,276
. . .whatever that is.

20
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:17,156
The lnterstate Commerce Commission?

21
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:19,356
-He didn't say that.
-Yes, he did.

22
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:20,516
Hold this.

23
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:22,436
Tell them, "Don't shoot. "

24
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:24,756
-Get back here!
-Hang on a second.

25
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:26,596
Strap in. This'll get weird.

26
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,316
I got to talk to him.

27
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:29,676
Go away!

28
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,076
Any improper behavior on the part
of any employee must be reported!

29
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:36,556
Just be easy, man. Look, I just want
to talk. I got no gun.

30
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:39,396
-I got no gun.
-I'll kill myself!

31
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:41,716
I believe you, I just got a question.

32
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:43,956
You work for the Commerce Commission?

33
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:46,436
No! They let me go! Threw me out!

34
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:49,196
You too?
They evicted me too.

35
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:53,916
They bought my apartment building so
they could turn it into a garage for--

36
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:55,596
They're so unfair!

37
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:58,636
I agree! The Durable Goods Division.

38
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:00,356
What the hell is that?

39
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:04,236
Don't work there anymore,
and they're on the second floor!

40
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:08,876
Do you know who I could talk to because
I phone, write and nobody calls me.

41
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:10,596
It's driving me crazy.

42
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:12,196
No! I'm crazy!

43
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,276
They were going to shoot you.

44
00:02:23,596 --> 00:02:25,956
Christ, Regis, what are you, insane?

45
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:28,116
The gun's on safety.

46
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,596
All right, boys,
I'm thinking this looks. . .

47
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:33,996
. . .handled.

48
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:36,476
Let's get out of here.

49
00:05:13,836 --> 00:05:15,076
Go, go!

50
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:17,156
Sector 6 secure.

51
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:26,476
Sector 1 secure.

52
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:39,476
Cory Luchessi.

53
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:41,956
I work here.

54
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:46,596
Sector 5 secure.

55
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,916
There's a gun on you. Get up, slowly.

56
00:05:55,716 --> 00:05:56,996
Sorry, sir.

57
00:05:57,636 --> 00:05:58,716
Sector 2 secure.

58
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:09,236
Sector 3 secure.

59
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,036
All sectors secure.

60
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:21,756
America held hostage, day 182.
A special report.

61
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:25,796
CNN has just received
this smuggled footage...

62
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:30,556
...showing American soldiers
in captivity and under extreme duress.

63
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:31,556
You see this?

64
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:34,516
The Government expressed outrage
upon viewing the tapes.

65
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:38,116
Sources say the U. S. Seventh Fleet
remains on full alert...

66
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:40,436
...in the Sea of Japan at this hour.

67
00:06:40,756 --> 00:06:43,876
Air Force officials have reiterated
their initial statement...

68
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,916
...describing the mission as routine.

69
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:49,956
Can you believe this?
What is this President waiting for?

70
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:55,836
Is leaseholder one word or two?

71
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:57,636
One.

72
00:06:59,156 --> 00:06:59,996
Damn!

73
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:03,196
In the face of growing support
for military intervention...

74
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:06,036
... the President urged patience,
stating negotiations--

75
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:07,956
Oh, I see.

76
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:11,556
So you negotiate for 1 3.
How many do you go to war for? 1 4?

77
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:13,556
Everything's about numbers.

78
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:17,076
Two drinks a day. Healthy. Three. . .

79
00:07:18,556 --> 00:07:19,396
. . .you're an alcoholic.

80
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:22,196
-That's your third.
-Get me again, man.

81
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:28,516
It's Farr.

82
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:30,716
I'm not here.

83
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:34,636
Captain?

84
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:36,836
Yeah, I got a coat. . .

85
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,396
. . .and a tie.

86
00:07:41,676 --> 00:07:43,076
1 600 what?

87
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:10,676
Harlan Regis, homicide.

88
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:23,076
Detective Regis, come right on through.

89
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:25,076
Your weapon.

90
00:08:26,996 --> 00:08:28,596
You'll get it back when you leave.

91
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:30,996
This way, please.

92
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:43,076
Gentlemen. . . .

93
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:53,796
Straight ahead.

94
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,716
Look at that.

95
00:09:01,756 --> 00:09:03,876
Straight down this hall to the left.

96
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:10,956
Multiple puncture wounds
to the upper torso and base of neck.

97
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:13,996
Wound would be 5 to 8
centimeters across.

98
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:16,796
Rigor is progressive.

99
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,476
Get in here and take a look at this.

100
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:23,516
24, 25 years old, tops. She's a baby.

101
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,116
What is the world coming to?

102
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:28,916
-When was she found?
-About 1 1 .

103
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:30,836
-Name?
-Carla Town.

104
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:33,636
My best guess is
she's dead maybe 3 hours.

105
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,836
-Where's the First Family?
-Camp David.

106
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:37,916
Left yesterday afternoon.

107
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:41,236
What's the murder weapon?

108
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:44,956
It's not as clean as a knife.
See the jagged edge of the wound?

109
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,836
It's not big enough to be scissors,
so it's something smaller.

110
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:52,036
Excuse me, all film stays in-house.
Orders.

111
00:09:53,396 --> 00:09:54,236
Whose orders?

112
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,796
What was she doing here so late?

113
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:06,076
You're not cleared.

114
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:09,236
Who invited you here?

115
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:10,436
We did.

116
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:14,636
Sir, he's a D.C. homicide cop.

117
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:18,676
If I'm not mistaken,
what I see over there is a homicide.

118
00:10:18,956 --> 00:10:19,836
But jurisdiction--

119
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:21,116
It can go to hell.

120
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,236
I'm in charge of White House security.

121
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:27,996
I'm the President's National Security
Advisor.

122
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:32,116
A murder 40 yards from where
the President sleeps. . .

123
00:10:32,436 --> 00:10:34,276
. . .is a matter of national security.

124
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:37,156
Alvin Jordan.

125
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:39,356
Harlan Regis, homicide.

126
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:42,796
Do you know why she was working so late
on Friday night?

127
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:45,596
The government doesn't close
because it's Friday.

128
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:47,956
Yes, I understand.

129
00:10:48,956 --> 00:10:51,756
Do you know how many people were
in the White House?

130
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:56,476
31 .

131
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:58,076
31 ?

132
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:01,556
Carry on, Detective.

133
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:02,756
Thank you.

134
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:07,956
Avoid using two words if you give
any statements to the media.

135
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:10,116
The words are "woman" and "murder. "

136
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:15,076
You say, "All information will be
forthcoming on a timely basis. "

137
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:18,836
One more thing.

138
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:22,836
-I'll need everything you have on her.
-You'll get what's material.

139
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,276
This is D.C. Unfortunately she's mine.

140
00:11:25,596 --> 00:11:29,076
-She was killed in the White House.
-She was killed in my city.

141
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,516
She was killed in my house.

142
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:33,956
Don't forget that.

143
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:38,476
He's all yours.

144
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:44,316
I'm just trying to do my job.

145
00:11:47,596 --> 00:11:50,356
I guess I'm supposed to get
my briefings from CNN?

146
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,596
No, from your Secret Service liaison.

147
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:54,036
For the task force.

148
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:55,716
He didn't assign me one.

149
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:58,076
He did.
Nina Chance.

150
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:02,836
I see.

151
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,556
They think I'm BooBoo the Fool.

152
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:05,556
Excuse me?

153
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:09,996
I guess he figures I'll be easier
on you than some rookie with acne.

154
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:14,516
I'm an agent
for the United States Secret Service.

155
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:19,316
Which means I can answer questions
relating to White House security.

156
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:20,876
I resent the implication--

157
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:23,156
You resent the implication?

158
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,436
People don't speak English
in this town anymore.

159
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:34,036
Detective, it's this way.

160
00:12:34,876 --> 00:12:35,716
I know that.

161
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,476
No statement about...

162
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:42,236
. . .what's happening in the White House.
The First Family is at Camp David.

163
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:47,116
As you can see behind me,
the immediate area has been sealed off.

164
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:49,956
Sheldon Tercott, CNN,
at the White House.

165
00:12:53,036 --> 00:12:55,636
So why kill someone
from the Office of Protocol?

166
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:58,236
Maybe she sat some ambassador
in the wrong seat.

167
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:01,116
-They kill you for that now?
-It's a tough town.

168
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:05,036
If I'd known, I'd have put a turnstile
in and charged admission.

169
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:07,396
-Who else was here?
-Secret Service.

170
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:09,036
They started around 1 1 : 1 5.

171
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:10,996
They even took her garbage.

172
00:13:11,316 --> 00:13:13,476
If you want me,
I'm downstairs in 1 01 .

173
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:15,756
-Thank you very much.
-Anytime.

174
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:31,756
Wait a minute.

175
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:33,636
The body's found at 1 1 :00.

176
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:35,996
The Feds get here 1 5 minutes later.

177
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:38,996
How?

178
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:44,556
They don't even have cool sirens like
we do. Look at her photo album.

179
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:47,076
Look at this, Regis.

180
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,076
Is this the only one?

181
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:53,596
It's the only one I see,
but I just got here.

182
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:57,676
But I can tell you that the apartment
is registered in the name of. . .

183
00:13:57,996 --> 00:13:59,356
. . .Brookland Associates.

184
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:02,436
But that is about all I have right now.

185
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:24,036
1 .2 on the beach!

186
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:27,956
White House is giving out
sweet Christmas bonuses this year.

187
00:14:28,556 --> 00:14:30,036
Looks that way.

188
00:14:33,396 --> 00:14:36,836
I want a list of everybody
in-house last night between 9 and 1 1 .

189
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:38,356
And don't say it's classified.

190
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:46,556
Quick on the draw, Agent Chance.

191
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:52,916
There's only 30 names here.

192
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:55,916
All whereabouts accounted for.

193
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,116
Spikings told me there were 31 .

194
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:02,996
I see his name here.

195
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:06,676
So whose name is missing?

196
00:15:10,036 --> 00:15:12,276
Apparently,
Agent Spikings was mistaken.

197
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:14,636
The count is 30 in-house.

198
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:22,436
Check it out.

199
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:23,916
I'm on it.

200
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,716
Where are you from?

201
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:34,876
Iowa.

202
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:40,276
So why the Secret Service?
I mean, why not. . .?

203
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:41,956
Kindergarten teacher?

204
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,556
You don't look like one of those.

205
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:45,756
I was in the Olympics.

206
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:47,516
The Olympics!

207
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,996
That's how I got in the Secret Service.

208
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:52,596
-That right?
-I was on the sharpshooting team.

209
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,236
We met President Reagan. It was 1 988.

210
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:59,996
One of his agents was a woman.
She took me under her wing.

211
00:16:01,516 --> 00:16:02,356
Sharpshooting.

212
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,036
I feel safer already.

213
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,276
I brought home the gold.

214
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:17,556
Where are we going?

215
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,276
To my place. I got to change.

216
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,276
You're being evicted?

217
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:29,756
Whole building. Feds are tearing
it down to put up a garage for the. . . .

218
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,636
Interstate Commerce Commission.

219
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:37,276
Why do they need a parking lot here?

220
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:42,036
I'm trying to figure that out. Everyone
thinks I can fix it because I'm a cop.

221
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:45,636
Harlan, what's going on?

222
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,196
Mrs. Wallace. . . .

223
00:16:47,516 --> 00:16:49,916
Soon we'll be living
out of garbage cans.

224
00:16:50,196 --> 00:16:51,516
I'm making progress.

225
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:52,996
-Truly I am.
-Progress.

226
00:16:53,396 --> 00:16:54,516
That's what you call it?

227
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:57,996
Progress.
Yeah, you're making progress!

228
00:16:58,636 --> 00:17:00,316
You take care of your business.

229
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:03,836
What you should be doing
is taking care of your business.

230
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:05,796
I know what he's making progress at.

231
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:13,156
Make yourself comfortable.

232
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:25,396
Washington City, July 21 st, 1 861 .

233
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:29,156
This is Manassas.

234
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:31,076
First battle of Bull Run.

235
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:32,796
I'll show you something.

236
00:17:34,996 --> 00:17:36,036
Right here.

237
00:17:36,636 --> 00:17:38,836
Where Stonewall Jackson
got his nickname.

238
00:17:39,116 --> 00:17:40,756
That's Sudley Springs there.

239
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:45,996
Civilians used to take picnics
to that crest to watch the battle.

240
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:48,716
Amazing, huh?

241
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:50,676
How did you. . .?

242
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:53,956
I'm a homicide cop
in the homicide capital of the world.

243
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:55,396
It's cheaper than a shrink.

244
00:17:57,116 --> 00:17:59,236
You did this all by yourself?

245
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:03,476
The whole thing.

246
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:07,676
My father was a history buff
so he kind of rubbed off on me.

247
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:09,036
What did he do?

248
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:12,516
He worked at the Smithsonian
for about 34 years. . .

249
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:13,996
. . .as a guard.

250
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:20,716
How am I going to move all this?

251
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:24,596
First I must take it apart,
then put it back together again.

252
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,276
Oh, no. Hell, no!

253
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:27,916
I can't move.

254
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:29,636
I'll be right back.

255
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:46,796
Stand back.

256
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:58,876
Detective Regis,
Stengel's been looking for you.

257
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:00,676
Who isn't?

258
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:05,796
Remember that claim check?
I sent Greeley to the drug store.

259
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,476
Let's see what we got.

260
00:19:14,156 --> 00:19:15,916
And there she is. . .

261
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:17,756
. . .Iive and in color.

262
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:19,796
Where'd you get these?

263
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:27,076
We'll be late for the autopsy.

264
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:30,076
Her VISA card activity, last 24 hours.

265
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,356
Banning Travel, 1 500 bucks.

266
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:34,276
I got it by a nose hair.

267
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:38,396
Phone records, credit card, bank
account, all impounded, now classified.

268
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:40,316
She had a flight to New York. . .

269
00:19:40,676 --> 00:19:41,876
. . .reservation at the Pierre. . .

270
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,356
. . .rental car, flight to the Virgin
lslands, St. Croix. . .

271
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:46,396
. . .one-way.

272
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:49,116
Lady was buying a new life.

273
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,956
She wasn't coming back, either.

274
00:20:04,716 --> 00:20:07,236
The evidence indicates
a crime of passion.

275
00:20:07,716 --> 00:20:09,956
There's evidence of vaginal penetration.

276
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:13,716
There's traces of lubricant in the
vaginal tract and under fingernails.

277
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:16,956
The blows were from the left,
and powerful.

278
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:18,596
A condom was used.

279
00:20:19,796 --> 00:20:21,156
No semen. . .

280
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:23,476
. . .no blood, except hers.

281
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:25,156
No DNA.

282
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:28,236
Signs of force?

283
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:29,436
No.

284
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:31,476
So you're saying sex, not rape.

285
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:38,556
This doesn't leave the room.

286
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,636
It was here we saw the image
of an untroubled President...

287
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,756
...before the White House
murder cast a dark cloud...

288
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:57,996
...over this once highly
regarded administration.

289
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:30,436
Cory Alan Luchessi, janitor.

290
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:33,716
Nobody can account for him
during a 45-minute period. . .

291
00:21:33,996 --> 00:21:38,516
. . .prior to when the Secret Service
found him in the East Room at 1 1 :02.

292
00:21:39,276 --> 00:21:40,556
The time of her death is set. . .

293
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:42,116
. . .between 1 0:30. . .

294
00:21:42,596 --> 00:21:43,836
. . .and 1 1 :00.

295
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:45,796
He eats a doughnut. . .

296
00:21:46,156 --> 00:21:47,316
. . .then stabs her 8 times.

297
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:51,676
Lee Harvey Oswald was seen in the book
depository cafeteria drinking Coke. . .

298
00:21:51,996 --> 00:21:54,116
. . .a minute after Kennedy was shot.

299
00:21:54,516 --> 00:21:56,196
He's reading Soap Opera Digest.

300
00:21:58,436 --> 00:21:59,556
2 months ago. . . .

301
00:22:15,556 --> 00:22:17,196
That's not enough.

302
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:19,676
If that's all you got, you got nothing.

303
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:21,356
Except this.

304
00:22:21,956 --> 00:22:23,596
It was found in the bathroom.

305
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,476
It's the missing button. . .

306
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:27,636
. . .from a shirt in Luchessi's apartment.

307
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,236
Luchessi doesn't clean the bathrooms.

308
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:35,796
All right, where is he?

309
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:37,156
Being picked up.

310
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:41,236
What would it take for me
to see the surveillance tapes?

311
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:42,836
Not much.

312
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,636
Just an act of Congress.

313
00:22:48,636 --> 00:22:50,116
After you, detective.

314
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:04,676
That button was labeled
as found in the dining room.

315
00:23:05,596 --> 00:23:07,756
How did it get in the lavatory?

316
00:23:09,676 --> 00:23:10,996
I labeled it wrong.

317
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,076
Did you kill her?

318
00:23:28,836 --> 00:23:30,916
Did you have an affair with Carla?

319
00:23:33,316 --> 00:23:34,076
Never.

320
00:23:36,036 --> 00:23:37,996
But you came on to her, right?

321
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:44,356
You did come on to her, yeah?

322
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:49,556
Did you come on to Carla Town?

323
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:53,876
I came on to her. I mean. . .

324
00:23:54,196 --> 00:23:55,316
. . .did you ever see her?

325
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:58,356
She's hot.

326
00:23:59,836 --> 00:24:01,676
You take it further than that?

327
00:24:02,716 --> 00:24:03,516
No.

328
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:05,516
Listen to me.

329
00:24:05,876 --> 00:24:06,916
Carla. . .

330
00:24:07,556 --> 00:24:09,036
. . .was strictly hands-off.

331
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:10,836
What do you mean, hands-off?

332
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:13,236
I don't know.

333
00:24:13,676 --> 00:24:16,156
But then, that was the word.
The Secret Service. . .

334
00:24:16,436 --> 00:24:17,716
... was looking out for her.

335
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:18,876
How?

336
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:20,236
I don 't know.

337
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:22,636
Like if she worked late, say...

338
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,996
. . . 1 1 o'clock, 1 2 o'clock. . .

339
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:29,156
. . .the Secret Service guys. . .

340
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,116
. . .they would always drive her home.

341
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:54,636
Don't want that, don't want that. That!

342
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:14,396
This is an act of war.

343
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:18,036
This is the Pueblo revisited,
and he wants to negotiate?

344
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:19,436
Give me a break!

345
00:25:19,836 --> 00:25:23,596
Neil negotiating to defend us
at a table!

346
00:25:23,876 --> 00:25:25,796
He can 't even defend his own house.

347
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:38,876
Where's your rider at?

348
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,596
How did you get down here?

349
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:48,676
You want to live. . .

350
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:51,676
. . .open the door 2 inches
and slide your weapon out.

351
00:26:53,516 --> 00:26:55,236
Don't make me stain my linen.

352
00:26:58,396 --> 00:26:59,436
Out!

353
00:28:36,956 --> 00:28:37,956
Shit!

354
00:28:43,076 --> 00:28:45,116
It's a nasty-ass city, Regis.

355
00:28:45,396 --> 00:28:48,836
Congratulations,
you are now a statistic.

356
00:28:56,996 --> 00:28:58,116
Let me see that.

357
00:29:02,036 --> 00:29:04,356
Son of a bitch!

358
00:29:06,436 --> 00:29:07,756
So they're eavesdropping.

359
00:29:08,036 --> 00:29:10,156
Big surprise. It's the government.

360
00:29:10,436 --> 00:29:11,436
Look. . . .

361
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,276
They brought you in on this...

362
00:29:13,596 --> 00:29:17,676
...for the same reason they brought
Dallas doctors in to work on Kennedy.

363
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:21,796
They go the extra mile so no one'll say
they couldn 't have done more.

364
00:29:22,116 --> 00:29:25,076
You never would've let me hold Luchessi
on what they have.

365
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,556
You know that.

366
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:32,116
All right, go take another look at it.

367
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:35,156
But don 't make any fucking noise
till you have something real.

368
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:37,956
Yes, sir.

369
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:57,636
Come on, Carla.

370
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,796
Talk to me.

371
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:30,916
This is full frame?

372
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:33,196
The machines automatically crop.

373
00:30:33,516 --> 00:30:35,756
-Can you get me closer to this?
-No problem.

374
00:30:43,036 --> 00:30:45,556
He's Secret Service.
Can you make me a hard copy?

375
00:30:48,996 --> 00:30:50,676
Thank you. You the man!

376
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:53,836
Is there any progress in the case?

377
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:58,356
Was the First Family involved?

378
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:16,836
Can I have a fruit juice, please?

379
00:31:25,956 --> 00:31:27,436
Aren't you the. . .?

380
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:29,156
The Speaker of the House.

381
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:31,036
How you doing?

382
00:31:31,316 --> 00:31:32,476
Good, thanks.

383
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:36,356
Do you ever speak to anyone
at the lnterstate Commerce Commission?

384
00:31:49,636 --> 00:31:53,836
They're some organization, I'm not
really sure, but they're evicting me.

385
00:31:54,716 --> 00:31:56,676
Excuse me, Mr. Speaker. . .

386
00:31:58,556 --> 00:32:00,836
. . .the detective is needed elsewhere.

387
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:05,556
Don't worry about it, I'll call you.

388
00:32:07,396 --> 00:32:08,756
What're you doing here?

389
00:32:09,156 --> 00:32:10,476
Trying to find you.

390
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:13,716
The task force is closed.
We have a suspect.

391
00:32:14,036 --> 00:32:15,316
Yeah. Me too.

392
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:18,036
Who's that?

393
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:21,876
He's Secret Service. You should know.

394
00:32:22,196 --> 00:32:23,396
I can't tell you.

395
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:25,196
Is that classified too?

396
00:32:25,516 --> 00:32:28,596
-Yes, it is.
-Then I'll have to find out for myself.

397
00:32:36,356 --> 00:32:37,556
There he is.

398
00:32:39,396 --> 00:32:41,796
The one who just stepped to the podium.

399
00:32:42,116 --> 00:32:42,996
What's his name?

400
00:32:43,236 --> 00:32:44,996
I can't tell you that.

401
00:32:45,316 --> 00:32:48,676
Either you help me or I'll find out the
loud way.

402
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:53,396
Please.

403
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:55,476
-What's his name?
-Burton Cash.

404
00:32:55,796 --> 00:32:57,236
Who's he assigned to?

405
00:32:58,356 --> 00:32:59,436
Kyle Neil.

406
00:33:00,196 --> 00:33:01,596
The President's son?

407
00:33:09,716 --> 00:33:10,636
Ladies and gentlemen. . .

408
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:15,676
. . .it is an honor to present
the First Lady of the United States. . .

409
00:33:16,556 --> 00:33:17,876
. . .Mrs. Kitty Neil.

410
00:33:35,076 --> 00:33:39,076
If the bodyguard was there, that means
Kyle was on that boat as well.

411
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:47,836
Kyle Neil was having an affair
with Carla Town.

412
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:50,036
He had sex with her that night.

413
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:53,716
Agent Chance, right here, right now.

414
00:33:58,876 --> 00:33:59,876
I've got to go.

415
00:34:00,196 --> 00:34:02,516
How long before the media finds out. . .

416
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:06,356
. . .that the President's son
was banging her an hour before she died?

417
00:34:07,076 --> 00:34:08,356
I've got to go.

418
00:34:09,596 --> 00:34:10,596
Nice dress.

419
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:19,756
You are to have no further contact
with Detective Regis, understood?

420
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:22,596
What if he initiates contact?

421
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:25,276
I want a report, detailed and immediate.

422
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:26,476
Written?

423
00:34:27,876 --> 00:34:31,156
Beginning with what you two just
discussed right now.

424
00:35:34,356 --> 00:35:35,436
Kyle!

425
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:46,116
-We used to date.
-Then you know how it works.

426
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:06,596
I think you should get revenge.

427
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:08,756
Excuse me?

428
00:36:09,236 --> 00:36:11,076
You should get revenge.

429
00:36:12,116 --> 00:36:13,916
How do I go about getting that?

430
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:17,756
Move to New York, become a model
and don't take his phone calls.

431
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:19,236
Interesting.

432
00:36:21,636 --> 00:36:22,636
I need a drink.

433
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:25,236
-Like one?
-Your treat?

434
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:27,356
Sure.

435
00:36:27,676 --> 00:36:28,556
What would you like?

436
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:29,956
Whatever you're buying.

437
00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:31,076
Bourbon?

438
00:36:31,516 --> 00:36:32,716
Nice.

439
00:36:39,556 --> 00:36:43,556
After 2 bourbons, she's telling me
that his one mission in life. . .

440
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:46,236
. . .is to get laid in every room
in the White House.

441
00:36:46,556 --> 00:36:48,676
It sounds like a plan to me.

442
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,236
She even told me. . .

443
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:54,156
. . .Kyle once bragged about sharing
a mistress with his father.

444
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:55,716
Carla Town?

445
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:57,396
She wasn't sure who.

446
00:36:57,756 --> 00:37:01,876
It gets better than that. Her uncle's
company, Brookland Associates. . .

447
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:05,596
. . .is the leading East Coast fundraiser
for Jack Neil.

448
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:06,596
Really?

449
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:11,276
The company who leased the President's
campaign space owned her apartment.

450
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,636
This is good.

451
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:15,436
This is very good.

452
00:37:16,036 --> 00:37:17,996
I hope you know what you're doing.

453
00:37:18,596 --> 00:37:19,596
Good night.

454
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:20,716
Good night, dear.

455
00:38:36,596 --> 00:38:37,996
Do you want to see my badge?

456
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:40,676
Why'd you come here?

457
00:38:51,676 --> 00:38:52,796
So I'm digging. . .

458
00:38:53,116 --> 00:38:57,356
. . .going through People magazine,
and just happen to come across page 1 6.

459
00:38:57,756 --> 00:39:00,436
I find a picture of Kyle
coming back from Brazil. . .

460
00:39:01,076 --> 00:39:03,276
. . .and you standing next to him
with an earpiece.

461
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,956
I must've looked at
1 8 months of pictures of the guy.

462
00:39:08,436 --> 00:39:09,436
You know what I found?

463
00:39:10,196 --> 00:39:12,436
I found you were in over half of them.

464
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:16,156
You didn't say you were on his detail.

465
00:39:17,836 --> 00:39:18,836
Until when?

466
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:22,716
I've nothing more to discuss with you
about this. The case is closed.

467
00:39:22,996 --> 00:39:25,916
Agent Chance, when did they remove you
from Kyle's detail?

468
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:27,836
You show up grilling me about work?

469
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:28,956
Answer the question.

470
00:39:29,236 --> 00:39:30,076
Don't come here again.

471
00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:31,316
Answer me!

472
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:34,756
You expect me to violate
every oath I've taken?!

473
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:37,596
I have a duty to protect!

474
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:41,236
Your duty could send
an innocent man to prison for life!

475
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:42,916
Are you comfortable with that?!

476
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:47,676
I think you should leave.

477
00:39:50,316 --> 00:39:54,916
How did Spikings find a button in the
bathroom no other detective found?

478
00:39:55,996 --> 00:39:57,156
Did he plant it there?

479
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:58,876
I asked you to leave.

480
00:39:59,156 --> 00:40:00,316
Did he plant it?

481
00:40:00,596 --> 00:40:02,436
I don't know, okay?

482
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:06,876
Everybody's lying around here.

483
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,196
So, again. . .

484
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:22,236
. . .why did they remove you
from Kyle's detail?

485
00:40:23,636 --> 00:40:24,996
They didn't remove me.

486
00:40:30,116 --> 00:40:31,196
One night. . .

487
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:33,556
. . .I heard sounds. . .

488
00:40:33,876 --> 00:40:35,756
. . .of violence, fighting. . .

489
00:40:36,076 --> 00:40:37,156
. . .in his apartment.

490
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:40,716
So I went in.

491
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:43,076
And I found him. . .

492
00:40:44,076 --> 00:40:45,636
. . .beating up his girlfriend.

493
00:40:47,636 --> 00:40:48,956
He was ugly.

494
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:51,876
And they. . . .

495
00:40:52,756 --> 00:40:53,796
We. . .

496
00:40:54,676 --> 00:40:56,556
. . .covered it up for him.

497
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:01,116
That was even uglier.

498
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:08,036
That's when I asked to be reassigned.

499
00:41:16,956 --> 00:41:19,836
Look, I don't know what I would do
if I was you.

500
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:23,316
But I know
I could not let an innocent man. . .

501
00:41:23,636 --> 00:41:26,076
. . .fry for something he did not do.

502
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:31,396
Maybe you can.

503
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:46,516
Get Neil out!

504
00:41:46,836 --> 00:41:49,276
Bring our soldiers home!
Get Neil out!

505
00:41:49,596 --> 00:41:51,036
Testing. 1 , 2, 3.

506
00:41:53,036 --> 00:41:56,436
Response: North Korea has broken off
negotiations.

507
00:41:56,756 --> 00:41:59,756
A dark cloud seems to be hanging
over this administration.

508
00:42:00,076 --> 00:42:04,076
The FBI has not been able
to interview the First Son. . .

509
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,716
. . .now said to have been in the White
House at the time of the murder.

510
00:42:17,596 --> 00:42:20,996
I have this to add
to the Carla Town effects.

511
00:42:21,756 --> 00:42:23,196
Could you open it, please?

512
00:42:30,956 --> 00:42:32,596
Thank you, Agent Chance.

513
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:34,556
No problem.

514
00:42:36,396 --> 00:42:37,636
Go on through.

515
00:44:11,996 --> 00:44:13,116
Hello?

516
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:18,276
Any problem?

517
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,316
No, I finally found everything.

518
00:44:21,636 --> 00:44:22,476
You done?

519
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,636
Spikings wants to see you.

520
00:44:34,316 --> 00:44:35,196
Now.

521
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,156
Anything I should know about?

522
00:44:57,756 --> 00:44:59,116
I don't know. Is there?

523
00:45:00,996 --> 00:45:02,316
You were in the Olympics.

524
00:45:04,876 --> 00:45:06,596
You know about being a team player?

525
00:45:07,076 --> 00:45:09,076
Sharpshooting isn't a team sport.

526
00:45:12,996 --> 00:45:14,236
This is.

527
00:45:21,716 --> 00:45:23,156
We put our lives on the line. . .

528
00:45:23,716 --> 00:45:25,276
. . .every single day.

529
00:45:27,756 --> 00:45:29,796
You must trust your co-workers.

530
00:45:30,276 --> 00:45:31,676
Is there a problem?

531
00:45:31,956 --> 00:45:33,036
You tell me.

532
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:35,036
This case is closed.

533
00:45:35,796 --> 00:45:36,716
So I've heard.

534
00:45:37,036 --> 00:45:38,596
Harlan Regis hasn't.

535
00:45:40,556 --> 00:45:43,836
You would tell us
if he tried to contact you, right?

536
00:45:44,716 --> 00:45:45,956
Of course.

537
00:45:46,516 --> 00:45:47,516
Good.

538
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:54,196
Because if anybody found out. . .

539
00:45:54,436 --> 00:45:57,156
. . .he'd elicited your support. . .

540
00:45:57,516 --> 00:45:59,076
. . .for his paranoid theories. . .

541
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:01,796
. . .I'd hate to think how it'd look.

542
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:04,956
What people might think. . .

543
00:46:07,436 --> 00:46:08,636
. . .as a team.

544
00:46:10,956 --> 00:46:11,996
Why's the door shut?

545
00:46:12,276 --> 00:46:13,476
Excuse me?

546
00:46:15,156 --> 00:46:16,396
Why are your hands on me?

547
00:46:19,756 --> 00:46:21,196
Because if anyone walked in. . .

548
00:46:21,516 --> 00:46:24,356
. . .I'd hate to think how it'd look,
what people might think.

549
00:46:26,876 --> 00:46:27,956
As a team.

550
00:46:31,316 --> 00:46:33,756
This day and age,
they might get the wrong idea.

551
00:46:56,596 --> 00:46:59,836
Agent Chance examined
Carla Town's effects 8 minutes ago.

552
00:47:00,116 --> 00:47:02,276
Get her. And Cooper. . .

553
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:03,956
. . .do it quietly.

554
00:47:19,516 --> 00:47:22,116
Nina Chance, find her and lock her down.

555
00:47:27,316 --> 00:47:29,436
Cover the stairs, I'll take the front.

556
00:48:04,356 --> 00:48:05,196
We got a visual.

557
00:48:05,876 --> 00:48:06,836
I got it.

558
00:49:06,796 --> 00:49:08,196
Cover the front!

559
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,316
Your approval ratings dropped 1 9%%% .

560
00:49:36,596 --> 00:49:37,716
Your point?

561
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:40,956
The point is that
it's enough to distract anybody.

562
00:49:41,236 --> 00:49:42,276
From a sober judgement?

563
00:49:42,636 --> 00:49:44,076
I can't defend my own house. . .

564
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,396
. . .so how can I defend America?

565
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:48,956
We're a superpower,
let's act like it.

566
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,396
So is China. . .

567
00:49:50,836 --> 00:49:53,676
. . .which, last time I looked,
had a pact with North Korea.

568
00:49:53,956 --> 00:49:56,116
We can handle China. . .now.

569
00:49:57,236 --> 00:50:00,196
1 0 years time,
at the rate they're arming, who knows?

570
00:50:02,556 --> 00:50:03,836
Mr. President. . .

571
00:50:04,356 --> 00:50:05,876
. . .Iet's bring the boys back.

572
00:50:09,236 --> 00:50:10,996
We can go in with special forces.

573
00:50:21,516 --> 00:50:23,196
General Tully has a point.

574
00:50:24,996 --> 00:50:27,596
Poll in today's New York Times,
Jack.

575
00:50:28,556 --> 00:50:29,796
53% of Americans--

576
00:50:30,036 --> 00:50:33,116
Think we should strike
the North Koreans.

577
00:50:33,396 --> 00:50:35,756
The Vice President's point
amplifies mine.

578
00:50:54,836 --> 00:50:56,716
I'm not going to war over this.

579
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:03,396
I want the 7th fleet to stand down,
not turn around. . .

580
00:51:04,116 --> 00:51:05,116
. . .stand down.

581
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:08,036
That doesn't bring them back
to the table, we'll reconvene.

582
00:51:08,556 --> 00:51:10,476
Thank you, Mr. President.

583
00:51:10,756 --> 00:51:14,156
You may be prepared to sit here
while they torture our boys, I'm not.

584
00:51:14,436 --> 00:51:15,836
We're not being passive.

585
00:51:16,436 --> 00:51:17,836
We're being patient. . .

586
00:51:18,356 --> 00:51:19,596
. . .and prudent.

587
00:51:21,756 --> 00:51:25,356
It's my duty to tell you
your lack of action is almost criminal.

588
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:30,796
Then you've done your duty.

589
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,196
Now I'll do mine.

590
00:51:37,836 --> 00:51:41,836
I expect your resignation
on my desk in the morning.

591
00:51:42,556 --> 00:51:43,876
You shall have it.

592
00:51:47,716 --> 00:51:48,676
That's all, gentlemen.

593
00:52:18,956 --> 00:52:19,796
What's wrong?

594
00:52:21,076 --> 00:52:22,116
Here.

595
00:52:27,236 --> 00:52:29,276
-It's from Carla's answering machine.
-Right.

596
00:52:29,596 --> 00:52:31,196
How'd you get it?

597
00:52:32,156 --> 00:52:33,676
I stole it.

598
00:52:35,156 --> 00:52:37,356
Look, here's what you need.

599
00:52:37,636 --> 00:52:39,076
In her appointment book. . .

600
00:52:40,796 --> 00:52:43,516
. . .she has a meeting scheduled
for tomorrow in New York.

601
00:52:47,836 --> 00:52:49,476
Craig Nisker and Associates?

602
00:52:49,796 --> 00:52:51,036
He's the king of tell-all.

603
00:52:51,316 --> 00:52:54,916
His agency sold 5 of the top 1 0
scandal memoirs of all time.

604
00:52:55,876 --> 00:52:56,996
That's his motive.

605
00:53:00,356 --> 00:53:01,356
I'll be damned!

606
00:53:02,356 --> 00:53:05,516
"Jack, Kyle and Carla:
The Oval Office Threesome. "

607
00:53:05,876 --> 00:53:07,956
He figured she'd burn the whole family.

608
00:53:09,076 --> 00:53:10,356
She'd score big with this.

609
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:12,956
I guess Kyle found out about it.

610
00:53:14,076 --> 00:53:15,276
We can place him at the scene.

611
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:18,116
And he had history of
violence against women.

612
00:53:18,716 --> 00:53:19,596
That's it.

613
00:53:21,316 --> 00:53:22,676
He's mine.

614
00:53:23,876 --> 00:53:25,516
You just don't get it.

615
00:53:26,196 --> 00:53:28,316
These people can make us disappear.

616
00:53:32,116 --> 00:53:32,996
I've got to go.

617
00:53:34,276 --> 00:53:35,196
Where?

618
00:53:35,676 --> 00:53:37,236
I checked into a motel.

619
00:53:37,876 --> 00:53:38,916
I'll call you.

620
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,516
Be careful.

621
00:53:48,236 --> 00:53:50,356
The court may direct what?

622
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:52,196
Mr. Peterson?

623
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:54,756
Under 21 98. . .

624
00:53:55,036 --> 00:53:56,316
. . .of the criminal code. . .

625
00:53:56,636 --> 00:53:59,956
. . .the court may allocate a fine
for the children of the victim.

626
00:54:00,276 --> 00:54:04,036
Please, what is it?
The porch light's on, but nobody's home?

627
00:54:05,156 --> 00:54:06,436
Or the victim's spouse.

628
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:07,516
Incorrect.

629
00:54:11,636 --> 00:54:14,876
The court may direct the fine be paid
to the female seduced. . .

630
00:54:15,156 --> 00:54:17,436
. . .or her child, if she have any.

631
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:19,916
Pursuant to this statute. . .

632
00:54:20,196 --> 00:54:23,156
. . .we have Desmond versus Preston,
which states:

633
00:54:24,356 --> 00:54:28,996
"Where testimony in rape prosecution
concerning clothing of defendant was--"

634
00:54:29,316 --> 00:54:30,316
What is it?

635
00:54:30,796 --> 00:54:31,876
Heavy date?

636
00:54:32,996 --> 00:54:34,836
Yeah. That's pretty funny.

637
00:55:13,756 --> 00:55:14,796
What's going on?

638
00:55:15,156 --> 00:55:16,796
I just need your car, all right?

639
00:55:50,876 --> 00:55:52,916
-Get off of me!
-Easy, easy!

640
00:55:53,596 --> 00:55:55,076
You are a son of a bitch!

641
00:55:55,396 --> 00:55:56,676
I'm going to have your badge.

642
00:55:56,996 --> 00:55:59,276
Why didn't you shoot her
if you had this?

643
00:55:59,596 --> 00:56:00,516
You know who I am?

644
00:56:00,836 --> 00:56:03,716
I don't give a shit!
You're going down. Turn around.

645
00:56:04,116 --> 00:56:05,796
-Get off of me.
-Get over here.

646
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:09,516
Just like a big fish,
fell right for the bait.

647
00:56:10,356 --> 00:56:11,556
Only guilty men do that.

648
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:13,476
Or one who's being framed.

649
00:56:13,756 --> 00:56:15,836
You had sex with her, then offed her.

650
00:56:16,116 --> 00:56:17,196
Oh, Jesus!

651
00:56:17,516 --> 00:56:20,796
You think it was an accident
she was murdered after I slept with her?

652
00:56:21,076 --> 00:56:23,036
Someone knew I'd be with her.

653
00:56:23,316 --> 00:56:25,476
Someone with a motive as good as yours.

654
00:56:25,756 --> 00:56:26,716
What motive?

655
00:56:26,996 --> 00:56:28,676
Did your father have sex with Carla?

656
00:56:29,156 --> 00:56:30,956
I don't know my father's sexual rÚsumÚ.

657
00:56:31,316 --> 00:56:34,156
-You knew she was leaving town.
-Yeah, I read newspapers.

658
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:37,836
2 nights in New York, then to
the Virgin lslands, and a rental car.

659
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:41,516
Carla Town
didn't have a driver's license.

660
00:56:43,836 --> 00:56:45,356
You think I killed Carla?

661
00:56:47,076 --> 00:56:48,516
Think you can prosecute me?

662
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:51,796
Your arms don't reach that high.

663
00:56:53,636 --> 00:56:55,156
So why did you show up?

664
00:56:57,516 --> 00:57:00,596
I go to sleep every night thinking of
a woman with 8 stab wounds.

665
00:57:01,516 --> 00:57:03,636
A woman I slept with an hour before.

666
00:57:03,956 --> 00:57:05,356
Try that as a sleeping pill.

667
00:57:09,156 --> 00:57:10,676
You forgot something.

668
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:34,836
Rivaling the Korean hostage-taking
as an issue for the White House...

669
00:57:35,156 --> 00:57:37,596
... the murder of Carla Town
remains unsolved.

670
00:57:37,876 --> 00:57:41,756
As the attention of homicide detectives
turn to Kyle Neil...

671
00:57:42,116 --> 00:57:44,156
...and the President's
approval ratings drop...

672
00:57:44,436 --> 00:57:47,956
... we must ask, will this
be Jack Neil's Chappaquiddick?

673
00:57:48,236 --> 00:57:50,276
No one knows where the trail will end.

674
00:57:50,956 --> 00:57:54,116
But for an administration
deep in the troubled waters...

675
00:57:54,676 --> 00:57:57,676
...of a potential confrontation
in North Korea...

676
00:57:57,996 --> 00:57:59,756
...a serious domestic concern...

677
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:03,196
...is especially dangerous
to the President's public image.

678
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:07,836
If Jack Neil cannot protect
the workers under his own roof--

679
00:58:42,276 --> 00:58:43,116
Coffee?

680
00:58:48,236 --> 00:58:49,796
Come on, Regis.

681
00:59:21,676 --> 00:59:23,076
Sorry I'm late.

682
00:59:24,796 --> 00:59:25,836
What's wrong?

683
00:59:26,556 --> 00:59:27,596
What is it?

684
00:59:27,956 --> 00:59:28,996
They were there.

685
00:59:29,396 --> 00:59:30,276
Who was where?

686
00:59:30,556 --> 00:59:32,036
The President and the First Lady.

687
00:59:33,716 --> 00:59:36,756
They were in the White House
when Carla was murdered!

688
00:59:37,036 --> 00:59:37,956
How do you know?

689
00:59:38,196 --> 00:59:40,436
That morning I almost shot their dog.

690
00:59:41,196 --> 00:59:43,036
They never go anywhere without it.

691
00:59:44,396 --> 00:59:47,596
I saw footage of them coming back
from Camp David with the dog.

692
00:59:47,956 --> 00:59:50,196
Their alibi is complete bullshit!

693
00:59:50,516 --> 00:59:53,156
They took them to Camp David
after the body was found.

694
00:59:55,116 --> 00:59:56,196
Spikings.

695
00:59:56,716 --> 00:59:58,636
He could've smuggled them out.

696
00:59:59,956 --> 01:00:00,796
How?

697
01:00:01,596 --> 01:00:03,476
The tunnels under the White House.

698
01:00:05,156 --> 01:00:06,796
I built this city, remember?

699
01:00:07,156 --> 01:00:08,716
I just can't believe this.

700
01:00:09,716 --> 01:00:12,156
They covered it up, got them out. Why?

701
01:00:12,756 --> 01:00:15,836
Because then they would be
considered suspects.

702
01:00:18,036 --> 01:00:20,436
Why shouldn't they be?
That's the question.

703
01:00:21,396 --> 01:00:23,116
Because he's the President.

704
01:00:23,436 --> 01:00:25,836
What does that mean?
He doesn 't have a motive?

705
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:29,276
He has a mistress about to
drop a tell-all. That's motive enough.

706
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:33,076
Wounds are from the left.
President Neil is right-handed.

707
01:00:33,356 --> 01:00:34,916
Yeah, I noticed that.

708
01:00:35,796 --> 01:00:37,596
He writes with his right hand. . .

709
01:00:38,036 --> 01:00:40,716
. . .but he swings a baseball bat
and golf club with his left.

710
01:00:41,756 --> 01:00:43,036
Jesus!

711
01:00:45,356 --> 01:00:48,076
She's still there.
Do you want me to finish this?

712
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:50,676
No, they're right where we want them.

713
01:00:50,996 --> 01:00:52,196
We're right on schedule.

714
01:01:06,516 --> 01:01:09,756
Thanks, Regis. I appreciate it.
I can take care of myself.

715
01:01:10,196 --> 01:01:13,636
I want you to lay low until
I get to Jordan or Spikings.

716
01:01:17,956 --> 01:01:19,356
Secret Service.

717
01:01:21,716 --> 01:01:22,636
Back door!

718
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:40,556
Move!

719
01:01:42,316 --> 01:01:43,436
Get them!

720
01:01:52,116 --> 01:01:52,996
Go!

721
01:02:31,556 --> 01:02:32,996
Go for the gas tank.

722
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:34,636
He's clear.

723
01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:14,636
What about Nina Chance?

724
01:03:18,516 --> 01:03:20,796
You want the spotlight?
Become a rock star!

725
01:03:21,076 --> 01:03:23,076
I'd reassign you,
but it'd make more news!

726
01:03:25,596 --> 01:03:26,316
Come in!

727
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:29,556
Call for you, Regis.

728
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:31,116
I'm not taking any calls.

729
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:32,716
It's the White House.

730
01:03:34,316 --> 01:03:35,876
How lovely for you!

731
01:03:38,996 --> 01:03:40,756
That was some stunt you pulled.

732
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:44,596
Last night had nothing to do with me.
I was off-duty.

733
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:47,596
-That's difficult to believe.
-I don't care what you believe.

734
01:03:47,916 --> 01:03:52,156
If the President was in residence that
night, why didn't you tell me?

735
01:03:52,436 --> 01:03:54,196
The President's not to be involved.

736
01:03:54,516 --> 01:03:56,716
The President is about to be
an official suspect.

737
01:03:58,356 --> 01:03:59,436
Suspect?

738
01:03:59,796 --> 01:04:00,836
I must question--

739
01:04:01,076 --> 01:04:02,636
You won't question the President!

740
01:04:03,636 --> 01:04:05,916
The Presidency is an institution,
not a person.

741
01:04:06,316 --> 01:04:08,756
And that institution will be
protected at all costs.

742
01:04:09,036 --> 01:04:11,996
-Why do you think we got him out?
-To cover up a crime.

743
01:04:12,276 --> 01:04:16,636
To keep the smell of blood from North
Korea. We'd never get our boys back.

744
01:04:17,836 --> 01:04:19,156
This is global, detective.

745
01:04:19,436 --> 01:04:20,636
It's a bit off your turf.

746
01:04:20,956 --> 01:04:22,556
It's a homicide! It is my turf!

747
01:04:25,596 --> 01:04:26,716
Let me tell you. . .

748
01:04:28,636 --> 01:04:30,836
. . .I've known Jack Neil for 3 decades.

749
01:04:31,156 --> 01:04:34,276
I'm godfather to his son.
Your suspicions are ludicrous.

750
01:04:34,876 --> 01:04:36,156
Luchessi's a stooge.

751
01:04:36,436 --> 01:04:37,956
-Then prove it.
-How?

752
01:04:38,356 --> 01:04:42,356
Nobody can pinpoint the time of death.
He can't prove where he was.

753
01:04:42,716 --> 01:04:46,276
27 cameras cover the hallways
of the White House.

754
01:04:48,396 --> 01:04:52,996
Are you telling me none of them saw her
within 3 minutes of her death?

755
01:04:54,356 --> 01:04:56,356
Are you trying to tell me?

756
01:04:58,996 --> 01:05:00,596
The tapes are classified.

757
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:02,236
Out of my reach.

758
01:05:02,596 --> 01:05:04,196
You Republican or Democrat?

759
01:05:06,676 --> 01:05:09,596
I think Washington is drowning
in a sea of its own bullshit.

760
01:05:10,196 --> 01:05:13,236
Those 1 3 men aren't risking their lives
over bullshit.

761
01:05:13,556 --> 01:05:17,396
It's not about 1 3 men. It's about
a dead woman in the White House.

762
01:05:20,956 --> 01:05:22,116
A Harvard study. . .

763
01:05:23,156 --> 01:05:27,116
. . .measured a man's longevity
by what he reads first in the paper.

764
01:05:30,196 --> 01:05:31,636
I'm an obituary man.

765
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:35,476
Start with comics, you'll live longer.

766
01:06:22,756 --> 01:06:26,076
Whoever leaked this,
I'm going to bottle their last breath!

767
01:06:26,556 --> 01:06:29,276
If she was alive at 1 0:49,
she was murdered well after--

768
01:06:29,596 --> 01:06:31,676
This changes nothing about Luchessi.

769
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:35,076
No one saw him until 1 1 :02.

770
01:06:35,956 --> 01:06:38,716
That still gave him 1 3 minutes
to do the job.

771
01:06:48,676 --> 01:06:49,756
So, Regis. . .

772
01:06:50,076 --> 01:06:53,316
. . .what are you going to do?
Put the President in a lineup?

773
01:06:57,276 --> 01:07:00,196
You're Carla Town,
you're about to sell this story. . .

774
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,996
. . .move to paradise,
so you buy a one-way ticket, right?

775
01:07:07,196 --> 01:07:11,036
This is Sears for Carla Town,
confirming Monday between 8 and 12...

776
01:07:11,356 --> 01:07:13,836
... to install the trash compactor
you bought yesterday.

777
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:17,756
Why have a trash compactor installed
after you're gone?

778
01:07:18,756 --> 01:07:19,916
Maybe she forgot?

779
01:07:20,516 --> 01:07:22,796
But she just bought it the day before.

780
01:07:24,156 --> 01:07:25,356
Shit!

781
01:07:25,956 --> 01:07:27,996
Monday, 4:30. You're right.

782
01:07:41,836 --> 01:07:42,716
What?

783
01:07:43,516 --> 01:07:44,676
Wait a minute.

784
01:07:53,596 --> 01:07:54,996
And the handwriting on the 23rd?

785
01:07:55,356 --> 01:07:57,716
The slope of the writing is different.

786
01:07:58,076 --> 01:07:59,276
Here, look at this.

787
01:08:01,116 --> 01:08:03,316
The loop on the L
is smooth and continuous.

788
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:05,076
In the day planner. . .

789
01:08:05,596 --> 01:08:07,196
. . .there's an obvious pause. . .

790
01:08:07,676 --> 01:08:09,436
. . .which indicates a deliberate stroke.

791
01:08:11,676 --> 01:08:13,116
It's on the B. . .

792
01:08:13,436 --> 01:08:14,596
. . .as well.

793
01:08:15,876 --> 01:08:16,716
It's a forgery.

794
01:08:19,076 --> 01:08:20,876
There never was an appointment.

795
01:08:21,236 --> 01:08:22,916
She wasn't going anywhere.

796
01:09:13,796 --> 01:09:15,116
Spikings. . .

797
01:09:16,436 --> 01:09:18,516
. . .entered at 1 2:09. . .

798
01:09:18,876 --> 01:09:20,676
. . .Ieft at 1 2: 1 4.

799
01:09:22,756 --> 01:09:23,716
Yes, sir.

800
01:09:24,156 --> 01:09:25,676
Surveillance tapes.

801
01:09:26,236 --> 01:09:27,196
He had clearance.

802
01:09:27,556 --> 01:09:28,556
Thank you.

803
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:30,796
Bob!

804
01:09:34,996 --> 01:09:35,916
Yes, sir?

805
01:09:37,436 --> 01:09:40,356
I want to talk to Detective Regis,
D.C. Homicide.

806
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:44,716
He'll want to question Spikings.
Get me his address in Alexandria.

807
01:10:02,076 --> 01:10:03,876
Someone's playing us like puppets.

808
01:10:04,156 --> 01:10:05,076
What are you saying?

809
01:10:05,916 --> 01:10:08,356
Carla Town wasn't killed
to protect the administration.

810
01:10:09,396 --> 01:10:10,956
She was murdered to destroy it.

811
01:10:11,396 --> 01:10:12,596
What do you mean?

812
01:10:12,956 --> 01:10:15,236
Someone dumped a dead body
in the White House. . .

813
01:10:15,556 --> 01:10:17,676
. . .so the trail would lead to the Neils.

814
01:10:18,076 --> 01:10:19,756
They even manufactured the motive.

815
01:10:40,356 --> 01:10:41,316
So?

816
01:10:42,756 --> 01:10:45,476
Only the guard knew I took the tapes.

817
01:10:45,836 --> 01:10:47,836
So you have someone on the inside.

818
01:10:48,156 --> 01:10:49,716
Let's stop playing games.

819
01:10:52,036 --> 01:10:53,076
Sit down.

820
01:11:13,076 --> 01:11:14,756
Do you know what it takes. . .

821
01:11:15,076 --> 01:11:17,556
. . .to stand all day in one place. . .

822
01:11:18,356 --> 01:11:20,476
. . .watching a dumpster in the rain. . .

823
01:11:22,756 --> 01:11:24,916
. . .because it's next to a hotel. . .

824
01:11:25,236 --> 01:11:27,436
. . .where the President is staying
the next day?

825
01:11:29,396 --> 01:11:31,636
When his life is in your hands. . . .

826
01:11:35,236 --> 01:11:37,436
Loneliest job in the world.

827
01:11:45,396 --> 01:11:48,076
Get rid of the wire.
I know who's listening anyway.

828
01:12:08,836 --> 01:12:11,276
You think you got it all figured out?

829
01:12:15,356 --> 01:12:17,076
You haven't read me right at all.

830
01:12:29,956 --> 01:12:32,116
I see my life and my service. . .

831
01:12:32,956 --> 01:12:34,236
. . .with a clarity. . .

832
01:12:34,596 --> 01:12:35,956
. . .you're incapable of--

833
01:13:51,996 --> 01:13:52,916
Shit!

834
01:14:22,556 --> 01:14:24,196
Shit! Cover me!

835
01:14:38,596 --> 01:14:39,476
Go!

836
01:14:41,876 --> 01:14:43,276
-You're a sharpshooter?
-Save it!

837
01:14:47,636 --> 01:14:50,116
Freeze China out
if they stand with North Korea.

838
01:14:50,396 --> 01:14:53,956
All talks for a grain deal cease
until they stand down.

839
01:14:54,236 --> 01:14:57,196
If China wants grain,
I want our boys back!

840
01:14:59,196 --> 01:15:00,596
You got 5 minutes.

841
01:15:01,716 --> 01:15:03,876
I'm afraid it'll take longer than that.

842
01:15:06,196 --> 01:15:07,876
It's bad news, Mr. President.

843
01:15:10,396 --> 01:15:11,796
It's still Jack, Alvin.

844
01:15:12,236 --> 01:15:13,596
Nick Spikings is dead.

845
01:15:15,756 --> 01:15:16,716
What?

846
01:15:16,996 --> 01:15:19,476
And he had evidence
that Kyle killed Carla Town.

847
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:24,316
Spikings collected it.

848
01:15:26,636 --> 01:15:30,276
They found a condom with Kyle's semen
and the woman's fingerprints on it.

849
01:15:31,116 --> 01:15:32,916
They found the murder weapon. . .

850
01:15:35,756 --> 01:15:38,836
. . .and the surveillance tape
putting Kyle and Carla together. . .

851
01:15:39,116 --> 01:15:41,276
. . .minutes before the murder.

852
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:45,516
There must be another explanation.

853
01:15:48,436 --> 01:15:51,436
Spikings was about to
cut himself a deal to leak it.

854
01:15:51,716 --> 01:15:52,996
Nick Spikings. . . .

855
01:15:54,676 --> 01:15:55,796
He wouldn't.

856
01:15:56,036 --> 01:15:57,276
Everyone has a price.

857
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:03,716
Not the first thing in your life
you've been naive about.

858
01:16:05,316 --> 01:16:06,676
Obviously not.

859
01:16:08,756 --> 01:16:10,556
You're safe now.

860
01:16:12,196 --> 01:16:13,476
So's Kyle.

861
01:16:24,756 --> 01:16:26,236
Spikings. . .

862
01:16:28,076 --> 01:16:29,276
. . .was murdered.

863
01:16:56,036 --> 01:16:57,276
See what we got.

864
01:17:01,676 --> 01:17:02,516
Jordan.

865
01:17:07,476 --> 01:17:09,556
21 : 1 8. That's 9: 1 8.

866
01:17:09,996 --> 01:17:11,556
He goes out there.

867
01:17:14,276 --> 01:17:15,996
We got a special on that model.

868
01:17:17,156 --> 01:17:18,436
Back off!

869
01:17:19,076 --> 01:17:21,356
Sure. Only a couple left though,
just so you know.

870
01:17:25,796 --> 01:17:27,956
8: 1 6 he comes in.

871
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,796
Can even throw in
a universal remote with that.

872
01:17:35,996 --> 01:17:36,836
Back off!

873
01:17:37,316 --> 01:17:40,276
Sure, sure. Take your time.
Just ask for Jack.

874
01:17:42,636 --> 01:17:44,876
He comes in and then he leaves with--

875
01:17:45,156 --> 01:17:46,036
Who's that?

876
01:17:48,556 --> 01:17:50,036
I know that guy.

877
01:17:55,116 --> 01:17:56,836
He's the guy at Spikings' .

878
01:17:58,676 --> 01:18:00,076
The 31 st name?

879
01:18:00,356 --> 01:18:01,756
Jordan walked him in.

880
01:18:03,796 --> 01:18:05,476
Jordan set up the whole thing.

881
01:18:08,676 --> 01:18:12,476
The investigation into the White House
murder has resulted in 2 suspects.

882
01:18:12,756 --> 01:18:13,516
The car...

883
01:18:13,796 --> 01:18:17,676
...a burgundy Chevrolet Caprice,
is the possible suspect car.

884
01:18:24,676 --> 01:18:27,036
There won't be anything
anyone can prove.

885
01:18:27,596 --> 01:18:29,476
All the evidence will be destroyed.

886
01:18:34,156 --> 01:18:35,436
What do you want?

887
01:18:39,076 --> 01:18:40,596
Your resignation. . .

888
01:18:42,796 --> 01:18:44,516
. . .effective 1 0 p.m.

889
01:18:46,796 --> 01:18:48,676
I don't know why you look surprised.

890
01:18:50,116 --> 01:18:52,276
Tully was right
when he called it criminal.

891
01:18:52,716 --> 01:18:54,716
Because we didn't attack?

892
01:18:55,076 --> 01:18:57,916
-You think that'd save our boys?
-You have failed!

893
01:18:59,956 --> 01:19:02,476
You have failed your office pitiably.

894
01:19:03,436 --> 01:19:05,596
I've seen your cowardice grow
from the beginning.

895
01:19:05,876 --> 01:19:08,636
Finally, not having served
your country in the military. . .

896
01:19:08,996 --> 01:19:12,436
. . .you had no idea
of the time-honored code. . .

897
01:19:12,716 --> 01:19:16,036
. . .of never leaving a man
on the field of battle.

898
01:19:19,756 --> 01:19:22,116
You should have
brought those boys home!

899
01:19:23,436 --> 01:19:24,916
Dead, wounded or otherwise.

900
01:19:25,196 --> 01:19:28,156
You should've done it
by force if necessary!

901
01:19:29,796 --> 01:19:33,836
Any President who serves up his country
as appetizers for the enemy. . .

902
01:19:34,116 --> 01:19:36,316
. . .isn't fit for this office.

903
01:19:41,716 --> 01:19:42,956
So the choice is yours.

904
01:19:43,236 --> 01:19:46,836
You can resign. . .
say it's due to your health. . .

905
01:19:47,076 --> 01:19:49,276
. . .and tour the best
golf clubs in America.

906
01:19:49,636 --> 01:19:53,276
Or you can stay in office
and watch your son destroyed.

907
01:19:56,236 --> 01:19:57,756
The choice is yours.

908
01:19:59,236 --> 01:20:01,596
If any father can call that a choice.

909
01:20:08,596 --> 01:20:10,396
Why didn't he just kill Neil?

910
01:20:10,676 --> 01:20:13,596
It's easier to kill the secretary
than the President.

911
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:14,836
Besides. . .

912
01:20:15,116 --> 01:20:16,596
. . .alive and ruined is better.

913
01:20:16,876 --> 01:20:17,836
Than what?

914
01:20:18,116 --> 01:20:19,276
Than dead and martyred.

915
01:20:19,596 --> 01:20:21,196
And now, this special bulletin.

916
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:24,636
An Oval Office address
is scheduled for 10:00 tonight.

917
01:20:24,876 --> 01:20:27,196
Sources say the President will resign.

918
01:20:27,596 --> 01:20:28,516
Jordan played his card.

919
01:20:30,756 --> 01:20:33,756
That gives us 2 hours
to get to the President.

920
01:20:36,596 --> 01:20:38,076
Are you insane?

921
01:20:38,796 --> 01:20:39,796
How?

922
01:20:40,236 --> 01:20:42,596
We'll use the tunnels
they used to get out.

923
01:20:43,636 --> 01:20:45,076
You don't know where they are.

924
01:20:45,356 --> 01:20:46,596
But you do.

925
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:49,476
You know the security and the layout.

926
01:20:51,716 --> 01:20:52,836
You're crazy.

927
01:20:53,676 --> 01:20:57,436
Why, because I'm helping a government
that's evicting me?

928
01:20:58,276 --> 01:20:59,996
You got no argument there.

929
01:21:09,676 --> 01:21:11,476
We got to get rid of this car.

930
01:21:23,636 --> 01:21:25,276
Don't say my name, just listen.

931
01:21:25,956 --> 01:21:28,716
Remember where we had
the double homicide 2 weeks ago?

932
01:21:28,996 --> 01:21:31,676
Meet me there in one hour.

933
01:21:48,556 --> 01:21:50,436
Get down. Cops.

934
01:21:50,796 --> 01:21:51,836
Two.

935
01:21:54,116 --> 01:21:55,196
That's the steam grate.

936
01:21:57,156 --> 01:22:00,516
It'll take us to one of the three points
vulnerable to penetration.

937
01:22:01,196 --> 01:22:03,636
Eisenhower put a water-filtering system
down in there.

938
01:22:03,956 --> 01:22:05,396
There must be an alarm.

939
01:22:05,676 --> 01:22:06,516
There is.

940
01:22:07,116 --> 01:22:10,396
It goes off across town,
the General Services Building.

941
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,236
No White House or Secret Service.

942
01:22:12,556 --> 01:22:13,876
Response time?

943
01:22:14,236 --> 01:22:16,116
Officially, 5 to 7 minutes.

944
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:18,676
But realistically, 1 0 to 1 1 .

945
01:22:19,436 --> 01:22:22,916
By that time, we'll either be fired
or we'll be dead.

946
01:22:26,476 --> 01:22:28,676
What do you think?
Meet and greet time?

947
01:22:42,676 --> 01:22:44,276
Good evening, officers.

948
01:22:44,596 --> 01:22:46,716
Tense night in the big city.

949
01:22:48,036 --> 01:22:50,596
Could be this thing
with the President maybe?

950
01:22:50,916 --> 01:22:54,516
Nice to know that we have
our men in blue out here to. . .

951
01:22:54,796 --> 01:22:55,956
. . .keep watch over us.

952
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:03,036
This has got to work.

953
01:23:03,876 --> 01:23:07,476
Didn't that Senator lay the wood
to that stripper around here somewhere?

954
01:23:07,756 --> 01:23:09,876
All right, take it easy this evening.

955
01:23:10,156 --> 01:23:12,596
Just asking.
Didn't see it on my guide map.

956
01:23:12,916 --> 01:23:14,396
We'll see you later.

957
01:23:14,676 --> 01:23:16,156
All right, gentlemen.

958
01:23:17,836 --> 01:23:19,356
Come on!

959
01:23:29,036 --> 01:23:30,036
Go!

960
01:23:32,596 --> 01:23:33,756
Be careful.

961
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:41,276
Come on!

962
01:23:42,636 --> 01:23:44,276
My grandmother moves faster than you.

963
01:24:02,156 --> 01:24:03,916
-Wait.
-Where are we?

964
01:24:04,236 --> 01:24:07,036
We're under the mall.
That's Pennsylvania Avenue.

965
01:24:08,316 --> 01:24:09,476
It's not far.

966
01:24:18,436 --> 01:24:19,476
Now what?

967
01:24:20,436 --> 01:24:21,556
End of the line.

968
01:24:21,836 --> 01:24:24,116
This is the old emergency water system.

969
01:24:24,516 --> 01:24:26,116
These pipes go through the wall.

970
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:27,716
That's where we're going.

971
01:24:32,956 --> 01:24:34,636
After you're sworn in. . .

972
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:37,716
. . .you'll salute Neil
for his service to his country.

973
01:24:37,996 --> 01:24:41,676
You'll ask for the country's prayers,
for bipartisan unity.

974
01:24:42,236 --> 01:24:44,116
Would you two excuse us now?

975
01:24:44,436 --> 01:24:45,556
Thank you.

976
01:24:50,676 --> 01:24:52,036
Gentlemen, at 2400 hours. . .

977
01:24:52,316 --> 01:24:56,676
. . .President Dylan will sign off
on the raid into North Korea.

978
01:25:10,676 --> 01:25:11,956
Look for a steel door.

979
01:25:27,916 --> 01:25:29,116
Army Corps engineers.

980
01:25:29,476 --> 01:25:30,676
These are escape tunnels.

981
01:25:30,956 --> 01:25:33,596
Built in case the Confederates lay siege
to the White House.

982
01:25:33,876 --> 01:25:35,476
Who says history isn't practical?

983
01:25:36,076 --> 01:25:37,356
We're running out of time.

984
01:25:52,516 --> 01:25:53,476
You first.

985
01:26:32,316 --> 01:26:33,276
You hear that?

986
01:26:45,596 --> 01:26:46,476
Christ!

987
01:27:00,156 --> 01:27:01,516
Go ahead, I'll be okay.

988
01:28:05,476 --> 01:28:06,956
We got to cross over.

989
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:09,516
In less than an hour...

990
01:28:09,796 --> 01:28:13,556
...Jack Neil will step down after
a little more than 2 years in office.

991
01:28:13,916 --> 01:28:15,796
For CNN, I'm Doris MacMillian.

992
01:28:52,516 --> 01:28:53,916
Let's do this.

993
01:29:05,916 --> 01:29:07,636
Wait. We're here.

994
01:29:07,956 --> 01:29:08,956
Motion sensors.

995
01:29:09,476 --> 01:29:11,276
They trip an alarm in the White House.

996
01:29:11,516 --> 01:29:13,756
Set it off, we're surrounded by agents.

997
01:29:14,036 --> 01:29:15,076
How long?

998
01:29:15,356 --> 01:29:16,276
1 0 seconds.

999
01:29:25,036 --> 01:29:27,036
We've come too far to turn back now.

1000
01:29:30,676 --> 01:29:32,356
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

1001
01:30:01,036 --> 01:30:04,196
Movement in 1 02. Repeat.
Movement in 1 02, subsector 1 1 .

1002
01:30:04,516 --> 01:30:06,516
Tunnels. Tunnels, subsector 1 1 .

1003
01:30:33,956 --> 01:30:35,876
You're under arrest!
Drop your weapon!

1004
01:31:09,996 --> 01:31:11,276
Cover sector 1 2!

1005
01:31:20,436 --> 01:31:21,956
Freeze!

1006
01:31:22,516 --> 01:31:24,116
On the ground! Get on the ground!

1007
01:32:19,636 --> 01:32:22,876
Clear sector 7 now and
report back to me only.

1008
01:32:36,836 --> 01:32:37,836
Let's go!

1009
01:33:37,556 --> 01:33:39,116
What agent captured?

1010
01:33:42,356 --> 01:33:43,356
Get her up here.

1011
01:34:03,716 --> 01:34:04,956
Not now.

1012
01:34:05,276 --> 01:34:06,116
Hold it!

1013
01:34:08,796 --> 01:34:09,836
Let's see l.D.

1014
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:14,436
Agent, gun!

1015
01:34:14,836 --> 01:34:16,116
The janitor!

1016
01:34:22,556 --> 01:34:24,076
Get him! He killed Spikings!

1017
01:34:25,276 --> 01:34:26,276
Mr. President. . .

1018
01:34:26,596 --> 01:34:27,516
. . .Kyle's innocent!

1019
01:34:28,516 --> 01:34:29,476
You can't be here.

1020
01:34:29,756 --> 01:34:31,756
I am here. Seal the corridor.

1021
01:34:32,516 --> 01:34:33,996
I am still the President!

1022
01:34:34,596 --> 01:34:35,996
Seal the corridor!

1023
01:34:38,956 --> 01:34:40,196
Jordan, you're under arrest. . .

1024
01:34:40,476 --> 01:34:44,116
. . .for conspiracy in the murder of
Carla Town and Nicholas Spikings!

1025
01:34:44,436 --> 01:34:45,516
You may remain silent!

1026
01:34:45,836 --> 01:34:48,636
Anything you say can be held against you
in a court of law!

1027
01:34:48,876 --> 01:34:51,836
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford one, you prick. . .

1028
01:34:52,076 --> 01:34:53,476
. . .one may be appointed to you.

1029
01:35:01,356 --> 01:35:02,516
How'd you get in?

1030
01:35:03,116 --> 01:35:03,996
I crawled.

1031
01:35:04,316 --> 01:35:06,836
He gave Spikings
the evidence on your son.

1032
01:35:07,116 --> 01:35:08,796
I have you on tape. . .

1033
01:35:09,196 --> 01:35:11,076
. . .with Carla's murderer.

1034
01:35:11,356 --> 01:35:13,996
The same man
who put a bullet in Spikings.

1035
01:35:14,676 --> 01:35:15,556
Stand him up.

1036
01:35:16,516 --> 01:35:18,836
Don't believe me, look at the tape.

1037
01:35:19,116 --> 01:35:20,596
It's in my back.

1038
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:23,836
Carla was killed to destroy you. . .

1039
01:35:24,476 --> 01:35:25,676
. . .to force your resignation.

1040
01:35:26,316 --> 01:35:29,116
Then Jordan had Spikings shot
because he saw the tape.

1041
01:35:43,796 --> 01:35:45,316
Arrest him.

1042
01:35:46,756 --> 01:35:47,756
Not him.

1043
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:49,876
Him.

1044
01:36:00,156 --> 01:36:01,836
My God, Alvin. . .

1045
01:36:02,596 --> 01:36:03,916
. . .you had her killed.

1046
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,836
I think Teddy Roosevelt said it best.

1047
01:36:07,276 --> 01:36:11,036
"lf I must choose between
righteousness and peace. . .

1048
01:36:12,596 --> 01:36:14,076
. . .I choose righteousness. "

1049
01:36:16,436 --> 01:36:19,876
She was 25 years old.
She was a child.

1050
01:36:20,116 --> 01:36:22,236
She was a casualty of war.

1051
01:36:26,156 --> 01:36:27,116
Mr. President!

1052
01:36:31,996 --> 01:36:33,716
Get him out of here.

1053
01:36:37,756 --> 01:36:38,956
Thank you, son.

1054
01:36:54,036 --> 01:36:55,476
Just stay easy.

1055
01:36:56,476 --> 01:36:58,916
Stay easy. I'm right here.

1056
01:36:59,716 --> 01:37:00,956
Hold on.

1057
01:37:06,196 --> 01:37:08,876
There's absolutely no truth
to any of those rumors.

1058
01:37:09,156 --> 01:37:12,396
At no time was President Neil
planning to resign.

1059
01:37:13,996 --> 01:37:15,556
Here's what we know so far:

1060
01:37:15,836 --> 01:37:18,116
The murderer of Carla Town is dead.

1061
01:37:19,436 --> 01:37:23,356
He was killed as he fired upon
authorities arresting him.

1062
01:37:24,556 --> 01:37:26,756
In that same gun battle. . .

1063
01:37:27,556 --> 01:37:30,596
. . .National Security Advisor
Alvin Jordan. . .

1064
01:37:30,836 --> 01:37:34,276
. . .and Senior Secret Service Agent
Nicholas Spikings. . .

1065
01:37:34,916 --> 01:37:35,836
. . .were also killed.

1066
01:37:39,156 --> 01:37:43,676
Did the killer penetrate the White House
with the objective of killing Miss Town?

1067
01:37:43,956 --> 01:37:47,196
In 1 80 years, there's never been
a penetration of the White House.

1068
01:37:47,516 --> 01:37:50,076
President and Mrs. Neil
will have a statement later.

1069
01:37:50,356 --> 01:37:51,676
Thank you very much.

1070
01:37:54,036 --> 01:37:58,476
Call D.C. Homicide, tell them the
detective is on his way to the hospital.

1071
01:37:58,756 --> 01:38:01,076
Paramedics say he'll be fine.

1072
01:38:02,116 --> 01:38:03,156
How is she?

1073
01:38:04,596 --> 01:38:05,876
She's stable.

1074
01:38:07,516 --> 01:38:08,836
You saved my life.

1075
01:38:11,156 --> 01:38:12,276
Thank you.

1076
01:38:16,356 --> 01:38:17,756
And detective. . .

1077
01:38:18,036 --> 01:38:19,676
. . .how can I ever repay you?

1078
01:38:20,196 --> 01:38:20,956
Don't bother.

1079
01:38:21,156 --> 01:38:22,596
Just doing my job.

1080
01:38:23,076 --> 01:38:25,076
Well, there is one thing.

1081
01:38:25,596 --> 01:38:26,836
Yes, detective?

1082
01:38:27,076 --> 01:38:29,276
You know the lnterstate
Commerce Commission?

1083
01:38:29,556 --> 01:38:32,116
Sure, Secretary Randall's office
is down the street.

1084
01:38:32,996 --> 01:38:34,276
Down the street?

1085
01:38:34,836 --> 01:38:37,676
See? It's not what you know,
it's who you know.

1086
01:38:38,196 --> 01:38:39,876
What are you doing for dinner?
