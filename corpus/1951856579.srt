1
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,914
Fuck you

2
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,715
Hey,

3
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,798
I'll see you in hell, baby.

4
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,193
Excuse me.

5
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,078
-Hi, honey, you were great.
-You think so? What about the clients?

6
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,157
They loved it. You were fantastic.

7
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,312
Look, I gotta go. I'll see you at the party.
Love you.

8
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,638
Hey, how you doing?

9
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,713
-Hey.
-Hey.

10
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,279
-I'll just...
-Great.

11
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,554
-Hi, hon.
-Hey.

12
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,237
-What do you want me to do with that?
-Take a sip.

13
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,993
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

14
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,072
if I could just have your attention
for a moment, please.

15
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,632
I am sorry to interrupt this great party and...

16
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,233
It is a great party, isn't it?

17
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,159
Yes, yes.

18
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,108
And I know you would like to show
your appreciation

19
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,872
for the man who has made this all possible,

20
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,349
created this wonderful company,
this wonderful organisation,

21
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,793
this great building.

22
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,270
Ladies and gentlemen,
our friend and our boss,

23
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,919
Matthew McKay.

24
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,152
Hey, everybody,
a small hand for Trevor Jones.

25
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,197
-No, no. A small hand.
-Small. Small.

26
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,835
It's nice to know that the lure of free booze

27
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,277
still gets the employees
to do that hard overtime.

28
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,793
Yeah.

29
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,670
Hey, I even got a full day's work
out of brother Bobby.

30
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,068
Put a few more hours in the day,

31
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,196
we could've fixed
the Sistine Chapel too, big brother.

32
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,430
Screw that guy. He didn't have a deadline.

33
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,556
-But you guys met yours.
-Yes, yes.

34
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,596
You guys are great!

35
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,638
Let's see. Who else have I gotta thank?

36
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,556
Oh! Oh, the beautiful,
talented, partner of mine,

37
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,269
the president of Client Coordination.

38
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,275
Julia, you're so sexy.

39
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,035
Julia!

40
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,798
You and l.

41
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,919
You know, Julia and I started this ad agency

42
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,516
with a few pesetas in our pockets
and a prayer in our hearts

43
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,113
and look at us now.

44
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,275
Wow.

45
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,834
Clients, they keep asking me, "Hey, Matt,

46
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,832
"how come your shit
always looks so great?"

47
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,474
The answer's always the same.
It's you guys.

48
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,677
Now, with the new JetAir ad,

49
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,069
we got the potential Sony campaign,

50
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,232
and what is the... The Hugo Boss.

51
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,469
All with big, fat-ass budgets, I might add.

52
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,429
We are becoming the hottest agency
in this town!

53
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,080
-Yeah!
-Yes!

54
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,557
All right, enough! Get drunk!

55
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,869
Yeah.

56
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,151
Well said. Well said.

57
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,678
-Hey, Trevor!
-Hi.

58
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,390
-You doing okay?
-Yeah.

59
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,028
-Hey.
-Hey.

60
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,476
What are you doing up here?

61
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,710
Down there's where you're gonna get laid.

62
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,634
No, thank you very much.

63
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,599
All they want is shorter hours, higher wages

64
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,797
and a chance to move up in the agency.
Not worth the trouble.

65
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,029
Right.

66
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,989
Yeah.

67
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,118
Hey, dude. Thanks.

68
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,788
Great job, man. Great job.

69
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,075
Sure.

70
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,194
-Trevor, what?
-What about my agreement?

71
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,394
Jesus Christ,
everybody wants a piece of me.

72
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,834
I need a clone, Trevor.

73
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,070
Clones are illegal and expensive.

74
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,312
Besides, that would just give me
two children to mind.

75
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,078
Sign my agreement.

76
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,831
-You won't be so overworked.
-Oh, yeah? You're sure about that?

77
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,672
My personal pledge.

78
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,794
You know, the agreement's
been ready for weeks.

79
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,233
Julia's signed it.

80
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,391
Now it's just up to you.

81
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,273
-Maybe I should move on.
-Oh. Maybe.

82
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,116
-What does the contract say again?
-You know what it says.

83
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,829
-The fine print.
-There is no fine print, Matthew.

84
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,556
It's simple. A single page.
I get 25% of the agency.

85
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,589
Okay.

86
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,509
I'll take a look at it tomorrow.

87
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,715
Yeah. Yeah, that's a promise.

88
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,399
-Hi.
-Hey.

89
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,910
-You made it.
-Yeah.

90
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,078
I made it back in one piece.

91
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,988
Trevor.

92
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,519
You rang?

93
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,552
I'm so hungover.

94
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,759
It's this annual accounting.

95
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,749
Are these credit card statements right?

96
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,037
Well, these are Julia's.
You'll have to ask her.

97
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,955
I know the cost of wine and dine,

98
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,396
but 130,000,
that's more than a few good meals.

99
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,156
Has Accounting seen that? Just say no.

100
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,554
Not yet.

101
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,914
Listen, we can...

102
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,468
We can deduct a slice of this,
but not the whole damn pie.

103
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,358
Okay, bury them for a few days, will you?

104
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,788
Trevor?

105
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,075
What is she spending it on?

106
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,389
How about entertaining clients?

107
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,989
You're getting more aggressive every day.

108
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,389
Yeah, well, stress is a great motivator.

109
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,435
That stupid expense report again?

110
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,080
I know. I wanted it to come
after the anniversary.

111
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,038
It's like, I put so much time and money
into this, you know?

112
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,792
I just don't want the surprise to be ruined.

113
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,518
-How many years now?
-Seven.

114
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,670
-Wow, lucky year!
-I know.

115
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,352
-Hi!
-Hi!

116
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,431
-Oh!
-How are you?

117
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,073
-Fine.
-You look good.

118
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,674
-Thanks.
-How's our sexy man doing today?

119
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,354
Oh, your sexy man is just great.

120
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,118
What's he doing here?

121
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,953
I don't know.

122
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,389
Hi, hon.

123
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,277
Who's your boyfriend?

124
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,110
He's a local tennis pro here.

125
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,397
-Tennis pro? What's his name?
-Juan.

126
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,870
-Don Juan? Mr Don Juan.
-Hi.

127
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,909
That's all right. Why don't you go practise
your forehand in the goddamn can,

128
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,474
Don Juan?

129
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,553
Excuse me, ladies.

130
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,197
Excuse me, lady.

131
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,076
-Hey, Eva, how you doing?
-Hi.

132
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,875
Listen, I'm glad you're here,
I've got a couple questions.

133
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,995
One hundred and thirty thousand
in cash withdrawals.

134
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,636
What the fuck is that, Julia?

135
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,233
You know what, Eva?
Why don't you go back to the office

136
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,548
-and pick us up some lunch?
-Yeah, sure.

137
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,834
Yeah, lunch.

138
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,434
You can answer me some questions
about thousands and thousands.

139
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,318
-You are completely drunk.
-I just had a couple drinks, okay?

140
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,799
Just answer me this question.

141
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,189
Look at this.
Thousands in lunches in the Pyrenees.

142
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,554
What's in the Pyrenees?

143
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,234
It's a client perk programme
that I'm working on.

144
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,312
-I actually think you'd be proud of it.
-Answer my fucking question, will you?

145
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,197
I'll see you at home.

146
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,631
What's in the Pyrenees?

147
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,594
Julia?

148
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,310
-How are you?
-I'm good, how are you?

149
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,870
-You're looking great, Julia.
-Thank you.

150
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,393
-So you got a beer for me?
-Of course.

151
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,072
We're almost done right now.

152
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,312
What have we here?

153
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,469
Could send a man over the edge.
What do you think, Alvaro?

154
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,394
-lt does tell a story.
-lt certainly tells the first chapter.

155
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,630
I have the distinct feeling
things are going to change around here.

156
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,950
They say the higher you climb,

157
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,915
the more people see your arse.

158
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,918
That's never bothered me.

159
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,113
I always figured the pleasure was theirs.

160
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,594
Where were you?

161
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,069
I was in a meeting. I left you a message.

162
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,918
That was three hours ago.

163
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,310
The meeting was long
and there was a lot of traffic.

164
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,708
Yeah.

165
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,994
-Matt, what's wrong with you?
-What?

166
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,839
-I don't know. What's wrong with me?
-It's like you're acting crazy.

167
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,235
Baby, I'm your wife. Talk to me.

168
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,629
Can we talk?

169
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,631
-Please. Yes.
-Yeah? Okay.

170
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,430
Well, I'm talking about the Don Juan,
the tennis pro.

171
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,671
I'm talking about lunches in the Pyrenees.

172
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,593
I'm talking about 130-fucking-thousand.

173
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,473
I thought we went through this already.

174
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,195
-Shut up.
-Shut up?

175
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,909
Yeah.

176
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,554
So why'd you take my money? Huh?

177
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,035
Did I take it? No.

178
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,839
Did I use it?

179
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,557
-Yes.
-Oh, you used it.

180
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,429
Okay.

181
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,635
-Come here.
-Stop. No. Stop, you're scaring me.

182
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,071
Matt, stop it.

183
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,908
Stop it!

184
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,629
Just do one thing. Just tell me the truth.
Can you do that? Can you?

185
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,153
-Can you... Can you do that?
-Yes.

186
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,310
Go away, go away.

187
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,675
You fucking...

188
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,440
Matt, you just hit her, man.

189
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,755
Yeah.

190
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,035
It's not like Xavi here
did a job on her, right?

191
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,951
I'm in a bad spot, bro.

192
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,399
Where does it end?

193
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,869
It'll settle itself, man.
That's how it always ends.

194
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,712
Bad spot.

195
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,193
Just lay off her face, bro.

196
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,192
She's a good-looking gal
and we don't need the bruises.

197
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,358
Matt, come on. Let's go to the bathroom.

198
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,869
Yeah.

199
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,074
Come on.

200
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,158
Maybe you should call.

201
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,836
Tell him he has to apologise
before you'll come back.

202
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,718
I can't trust him.

203
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,439
It's like he's become obsessed.

204
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,436
Trust and obsession
don't make a good mix, do they?

205
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,113
No, they don't.

206
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,160
Men bullshit like that all the time.

207
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,438
They think that acting jealous will make us
believe they're not cheating themselves.

208
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,798
Maybe he's having the affair,
and to cover himself, he's accusing you.

209
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,550
-Men are such idiots.
-Matt would never do something like that.

210
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,748
And he'd never hit you, either?

211
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,032
-Hey, Miguel.
-Hi.

212
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,198
Sorry I'm late.

213
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,789
You sounded upset on the phone.

214
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,517
Is everything okay?

215
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,149
No.

216
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,428
It's not okay.

217
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,556
Let's just finish this.

218
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,231
I don't know what to do.

219
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,591
He's changed.

220
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,198
He's gone crazy. It's like a side of him
I've never even seen before.

221
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,591
I don't even know who he is.

222
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,109
Matthew.

223
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,514
As you ordered.

224
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,269
Your wife, entertaining clients.

225
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,435
And,

226
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,757
partnership agreement.

227
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,999
To be signed.

228
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,192
Did I or did I not give you my word?

229
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,634
Matthew?

230
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,354
Matthew!

231
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,237
Fuck you!

232
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,549
Yeah!

233
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,518
Yeah! What...

234
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,033
What the fuck are you waiting for? Come on!

235
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,789
Who is he?

236
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,677
Are you following me?

237
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,388
-Who is he?
-Where'd you get those?

238
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,315
Those pictures aren't what you think.

239
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,030
-Wind down the window.
-No.

240
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,476
-Come on, open the door.
-No, you're acting crazy, Matt.

241
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,911
-Open the door.
-No.

242
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,395
Okay.

243
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,788
-What the fuck are you doing, Matt?
-Huh?

244
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,029
Stop!

245
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,557
-Stop! Don't you trust me, Matt?
-Trust?

246
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,758
-Trust?
-Why are you acting like this?

247
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,876
I'll show you trust, baby!

248
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,796
Those pictures are not what they look like!

249
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,836
He's an architect! He's gay!

250
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,069
He's gay!

251
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,878
I hired him to build a cottage for us.

252
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,916
It was gonna be a surprise for you.

253
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,559
I don't believe you.

254
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,311
-We're gonna die!
-Stop! Fucking stop, Matt!

255
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,555
It was gonna be for us.

256
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,671
-Why are you doing this?
-I don't believe you!

257
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,079
Watch out!

258
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,312
Please! Please!

259
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,953
Please stop!

260
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,270
Just pull over
and let me out of the fucking car!

261
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,952
Get out of the way!

262
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,113
Watch out!

263
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,472
-Baby, please! I'm begging you!
-Maybe you should drive.

264
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,391
No, please, I'm begging you! Please!

265
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,789
-Yeah! Let me see what you can do!
-Baby, stop!

266
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,518
-Help!
-That's it!

267
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,515
Let me out of the car, Matt! Pull over!

268
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,073
Watch out!

269
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,990
-Let me out of the fucking car!
-Till death do us part!

270
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,433
Watch out!

271
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,229
Hi.

272
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,639
Advice, honey.

273
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,433
Two words.

274
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,118
Restraining order.

275
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,679
Where the hell have you been?

276
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,671
You have no idea
what we had to go through

277
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,273
to get you out of here.

278
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,232
This is serious, Matthew.

279
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,799
You're both lucky to be alive.

280
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,438
Yeah, I heard she's in a hospital. Where?

281
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,233
And she's filed a restraining order.

282
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,669
Now with both of you gone,
I am running the agency,

283
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,150
so you either sign this, or I am gone and...

284
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,798
Which hospital?

285
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,677
-She's filed a restraining order.
-I haven't seen one.

286
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,114
Have you?

287
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,514
Where?

288
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,518
Hospital de Barcelona.

289
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,874
-Let's go.
-What? Me?

290
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,633
Oh, no. No, no, no. You're on your own.

291
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,115
Back off.

292
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,516
Security, we have a
visitor out of control.

293
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,239
Third floor, east wing.

294
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,272
Good... there, down the hall.

295
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,557
Sir, come with us
please.

296
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,358
Hi, this is Julia. Leave a message
and I'll call you back. Thanks.

297
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,271
Hey, baby.

298
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,628
It's me.

299
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,029
Pick up the phone. Pick it up!

300
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,749
Okay.

301
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,113
I'm sorry.

302
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,913
I really am.

303
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,510
You were right. I was wrong.

304
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,992
I need you, baby.

305
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,599
I need you.

306
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,757
I'm going to join AA, I'm gonna go clean.

307
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,673
I mean, this is ruining my life, you know.

308
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,717
It's ruining our life.

309
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,231
I need you, baby.

310
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,799
You're my addiction.

311
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,108
Call me.

312
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,392
I'm going to join AA, I'm gonna go clean.

313
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,869
I mean, this is ruining my life, you know.

314
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,237
It's ruining our life.

315
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,998
I need you, baby.

316
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,399
You're my addiction.

317
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,754
Call me.

318
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,160
I can just see it sliding here, bro.

319
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,669
Did you know MC Systems
wants to reconsider their offer, Matt?

320
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,996
When was the last time
that you screwed up a presentation, bro?

321
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,758
Oh, you don't remember?

322
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,718
The last time Julia left.

323
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,513
Man, I can see the walls
are just coming down around us, Matt.

324
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,989
And you and I are the only ones
picking up the pieces, bro.

325
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,277
Yeah. You see a lot
of fucking things, Bobby.

326
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,391
Yeah. I'm just seeing what's out there, Matt.

327
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,397
Nothing you haven't seen before, right?

328
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,549
Right.

329
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,835
Man, she should just fucking vanish. Poof!

330
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,957
Thin air. Bye-bye. Yeah.

331
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,990
It's your decision, bro. It's your call.

332
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,469
Yeah.

333
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,599
-The pizza guy.
-Yeah.

334
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,873
Xavi would do it.
Xavi would definitely do it.

335
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,757
It's your call, Matt.

336
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,349
Okay.

337
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,675
Just do it.

338
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,358
-Matt.
-What?

339
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,479
You're making the right decision, bro.

340
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,511
Alvaro, it's Trevor.

341
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,716
Do you know a guy called Xavi?

342
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,195
No, he... He feeds Bobby McKay.

343
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,636
Description? No, sorry, I don't have one.

344
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,035
But I know where he hangs out.

345
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,353
And he calls himself Pizza Man.

346
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,352
Oh. Okay.

347
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,356
I'll call you from the car.

348
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,792
I know this Xavi.

349
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,758
He's an old raider.

350
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,558
A real bad one.

351
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,834
You walk the streets,
I walk the hallways, life meets.

352
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,910
This was my gift to Matt McKay
three years ago

353
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,309
when we landed a large account.

354
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,835
He pushed a round in, fired a shot in the air.

355
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,232
The chandelier came crashing down,
smashed into a thousand pieces.

356
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,593
He likes to start a campaign with a bang.

357
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,555
Matt wants to kill his old lady.

358
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,515
Why?

359
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,230
She sleeps with her poodle.

360
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,070
You don't need personal stuff.

361
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,188
All you need to know is that Xavi
will see that it happens.

362
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,994
Do you know what this gun is for?

363
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,478
If she goes down with rounds from this gun,

364
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,518
and this gun is found in Matt's possession...

365
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,314
You follow?

366
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,436
Ballistics would nail him.

367
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,352
So I get to her,

368
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,518
and you get to him.

369
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,188
Simple.

370
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,875
You squeeze off the shots,
give me back the gun, I return my gift...

371
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,469
-Life goes on.
-Life takes a turn.

372
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,799
And Xavi?

373
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,111
Well, you have to make sure
you get to her before he does.

374
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,318
We don't want fucking Xavi
screwing up the world now, do we?

375
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,196
-What if McKay looks for his gun?
-Well, there's another one there just like it.

376
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,715
Don't you hate to buy a gift for someone
and not get one for yourself?

377
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,873
-lt comes in handy sometimes.
-You are one son of a bitch, Trevor.

378
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,759
I like to think we're sons
of the same bitch, Alvaro.

379
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,909
Hello!

380
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,679
Oh, let me see the ring.

381
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,558
Oh, my God!

382
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,198
Come on, guys.

383
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,269
Keep moving. Keep moving.

384
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,629
Do you have a shovel, Mrs McKay?

385
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,753
So you took those photos of me,

386
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,230
and then you discovered
my husband wanted to kill me?

387
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,434
I didn't see a reason for you to die.

388
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,271
But you must leave here.

389
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,312
Others will come.

390
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,277
I believe you're a practical woman,
Mrs McKay,

391
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,158
and perhaps we can arrive at some

392
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,677
financial arrangement.

393
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,158
-I can protect you.
-Protect me? How?

394
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,029
Mrs McKay, you were on your knees.

395
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,554
-Either he kills you or...
-I can't.

396
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,077
-I can't kill.
-You will die then, no doubt.

397
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,109
But if you wish to think it over...

398
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,679
Who are you really?

399
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,956
Just a man who appreciates

400
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,397
the gifts of others.

401
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,632
My brother's the curator
for a museum in Madrid.

402
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,551
My sister's an artist,

403
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,110
and her paintings hang
in the galleries of Barcelona.

404
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,438
It is unfortunate

405
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,674
when art

406
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,233
is abused.

407
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,952
And a tragedy
when such beauty is destroyed.

408
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,511
If I decide to do this,

409
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,113
is it possible

410
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,638
that you tell my husband that I was killed

411
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,671
and then I could surprise him
a couple days later?

412
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,272
Is that possible?

413
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,033
Of course.

414
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,799
What's a life worth, Mrs McKay?

415
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,910
-Any problems?
-No. No problems.

416
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,753
How was it?

417
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,831
Two shots. In the woods.

418
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,112
Put out a missing report.

419
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,591
I doubt we'll find her.

420
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,039
It's clean.

421
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,071
Let's go back to my place.

422
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,309
Yeah.

423
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,436
Matt, I just got word from Xavi.

424
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,077
Xavi? What'd he do now?

425
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,038
I don't know, Matt. He didn't go into details.

426
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,315
Yeah, details...

427
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,198
Look... Wait... Wait, wait, wait.

428
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,475
No...

429
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,677
No, l... I didn't want her to suffer.

430
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,037
I told you, Xavi's a pro.
He didn't go after her to make a meal of this.

431
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,792
She went quick, Matt.

432
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:01,029
Did she say anything

433
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,035
before she went, Bobby?

434
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,432
I'm in a fucking bar, okay?

435
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,956
And I told you I just got the word,
but I don't have any of the details.

436
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,314
But that's it. She's gone.

437
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,834
Listen, Matt. You gotta stay cool.

438
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,196
You don't want to know anything here, bro.
Okay? You gotta stay calm.

439
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,794
You're going to be questioned
about this, Matt, and so will I.

440
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,189
The last thing we need is the details
running around in our minds

441
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,918
when the fucking cops are in our face.

442
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,638
The less we know, the better we look.

443
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,553
You're going to feel a lot better about this
in the morning. All right?

444
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,189
Wait.

445
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,957
No. What? Yeah.

446
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,879
Hi, this is Julia. Leave a message
and I'll call you back. Thanks.

447
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,033
Hey, Julia, pick up the phone.

448
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,679
Pick it up. It's me.

449
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,992
Fucking Bobby's gone insane.

450
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,640
He's saying that you fucking...

451
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,870
I don't know, you went somewhere.

452
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,398
Anyway, it's important. Call me. I love you.

453
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,629
Hello?

454
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,312
Hey, Trevor.

455
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,470
Matthew, what's happening?

456
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,791
I... I did something...

457
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,872
And now, I'm going to do something else.

458
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,154
What are you talking about?

459
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,438
Julia. She went somewhere.

460
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,590
Where? Where did she go?

461
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,999
She went somewhere.

462
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,674
Matthew, will you please tell me
what's going on?

463
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,073
I got my gun in my hand.

464
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,076
And I'm gonna blow my fucking brains out.

465
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,516
Matthew, listen to me.
Put the gun down. Do you hear me?

466
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,715
I'm coming right over.

467
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,712
Just... Just put the gun away, okay?

468
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,278
I'm on the way.

469
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,950
Yeah? Huh?

470
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,679
Yeah?

471
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,391
Yeah, I'll call her. I'll fucking call her.

472
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,878
Hi, this is Julia. Leave a message
and I'll call you back. Thanks.

473
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,795
Julia, hey. Why don't you pick up
the fucking phone, you bitch?

474
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,389
Huh?

475
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,472
I'm just kidding.

476
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,635
It's really important
because I've got my gun in my hand.

477
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,476
I never fired a gun before, you know.

478
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,673
I love you.

479
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:15,199
He seemed fine when I spoke to him
on the telephone last night.

480
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,631
But, well, he had been separated
from his wife recently.

481
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,639
That's Julia.

482
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,277
It's so complicated.

483
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,353
They...
Recently, there seemed to be tension.

484
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,037
-Hi, I'm Julia McKay.
-Detective Jimenez.

485
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,269
Where's my husband?

486
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,079
Someone called
and they said that there was an accident.

487
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,078
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God! No!
-Please! Please!

488
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,193
-What happened? What's going on?
-Wait!

489
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,230
-Bitch! You knew this would happen!
-Hey! Wait a minute! Wait! Stop it!

490
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,118
What's going on?

491
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,317
-Oh, my God...
-You have to speak to her.

492
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,671
I know these are difficult times, senora,

493
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,797
but we will need your statement.
When you are ready.

494
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,955
I can't.

495
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,828
-Trevor, please tell me what's going on.
-Julia, I'm sorry, so sorry.

496
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,558
Maria. Xavi.

497
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,232
I don't know.

498
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,399
-Xavi?
-No!

499
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,469
Fuck!

500
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,149
What?

501
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,314
You gave me the gun.
You told me the job was done.

502
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,833
Xavi never showed.

503
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,998
I questioned your information on that point.

504
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,753
Why did you lie to me?

505
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,558
Xavi never showed?

506
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,108
Well, Xavi always shows!

507
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,998
He's a show-up fucking kind of guy!

508
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,795
Did you kill him
and take a higher price from her?

509
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,553
I have a question for you
of a more serious nature.

510
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,317
McKay shot himself with his own gun,
they believe.

511
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,595
Did you have time to replace his gun?

512
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,597
Or did he use yours?

513
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,910
Where were you between midnight
and 1:00 a.m. that morning?

514
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,798
I'm sure ballistics will tell in the end.

515
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,434
Wherever you were, don't worry.

516
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,229
Your secret is safe with me.

517
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,956
I gave you a down payment!

518
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,669
I'll return it.

519
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,836
But if you use it to touch
one hair on her head,

520
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,393
it will be the last living thing you do.

521
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,038
Here's your money.

522
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,152
You bastard!

00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,312
"The death appears to be a suicide."

530
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,833
Suicide.

531
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,471
"But an investigation
is now underway by Barcelona police."

532
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,955
What's his key man policy worth?

533
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,959
Not good.

534
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,395
Five million.

535
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,559
Yep. Let's pray it's a suicide.

536
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,591
Julia, do you have a moment?

537
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,359
Yeah, please.

538
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,316
Listen, I know this is probably
not a great time,

539
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,311
and there is no delicate way to put this,

540
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,748
but we are in the middle of campaigns,
shoots, product planning, development.

541
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,275
The clients are calling.
They want to know what's going on.

542
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,196
If we don't find a replacement
for Matt right away,

543
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,918
we could lose them all.

544
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,271
Well, perhaps this can wait. I'm sorry.

545
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,759
No, no, no.

546
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,114
Can you give me a list
of the possible candidates?

547
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,553
Of course.

548
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,075
I hear Frankie Barrera
is unhappy at Baseline.

549
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,073
You're right.

550
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,518
The crying is over and I'll get through it.

551
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,759
We'll get through this together, Julia.

552
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,759
All right, come on.

553
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,510
Let's go tell the troops
that everything's going to be okay.

554
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,152
Inspector Jimenez, the man had
a life insurance policy worth five million.

555
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,835
My company just wants to know
if this is being ruled a suicide.

556
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,956
-Not yet.
-Not yet?

557
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,713
With all due respect, the man shot himself.

558
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,958
When you shoot yourself, you die alone.
And he died alone.

559
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,519
What could possibly be the deal here?

560
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,433
The deal is you keep your foot off my floor

561
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,875
and wait until I complete my investigation.

562
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,069
Okay?

563
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,197
Mrs McKay, your husband's death
appears to be a suicide.

564
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,354
But we are obligated to investigate further
when a shooting is involved.

565
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,635
I understand.

566
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:50,792
We retrieved a video message from the
memory card of your husband's PDA phone.

567
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,839
It's for you.

568
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,077
Julia,

569
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,751
a lying,

570
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,753
cheating,

571
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,719
bitch.

572
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,919
I love you.

573
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,951
You're a whore. You...

574
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,353
Fuck you.

575
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,114
Hey,

576
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,592
I'll see you in hell, baby.

577
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,439
Oh, my God.

578
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,438
It goes on after that, then just ends.

579
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,273
It cuts out before he shot himself.

580
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,709
I don't know who he is. He's being crazy.

581
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,116
He's not the man I married.

582
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,911
Did you have contact
with your husband yesterday?

583
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,197
No. He left me a message on my cell phone.

584
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,919
And he threatened me.
I hung up before it finished.

585
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,678
What time was that?

586
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,718
It was around 1:00 a.m.

587
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,515
You have seen this before?

588
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,674
Yes.

589
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,355
Your husband believed you were involved
with this man.

590
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,674
These pictures aren't what they seem.

591
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,398
He's an architect. His name is Miguel.

592
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,311
I hired him to help me restore the cabin

593
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,789
I was going to surprise
my husband with as a gift.

594
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,950
And you told him this?

595
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,749
Yeah. He didn't believe me.

596
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,196
He got violent with me, so I left.

597
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,189
Am I a suspect, Detective?

598
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,239
My point is, your actions
may have led to your husband's death.

599
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,191
And the man in this picture?

600
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,754
His partner is my tennis instructor.

601
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,838
A male instructor.

602
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,239
I'm sure if you stop by the house they share,

603
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,675
they'll give you any information you want.

604
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,479
Would you like the address?

605
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,677
No, that won't be necessary.

606
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,435
As I said, we are looking at a suicide.

607
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,633
I will call you if I see it differently.

608
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,590
Thank you, Mrs McKay.

609
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,638
Good girl.

610
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,432
You're walking away.

611
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,554
It's best we not be seen by my colleagues.

612
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,358
What do you think happened?

613
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,637
You like to surprise your husband
in unusual ways.

614
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,156
Evidently, he didn't like what he heard.

615
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,912
He wanted to die.

616
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,874
I imagine he had some problems.

617
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,838
You're a dirty cop who preys on his victims.

618
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,037
You are fortunate
to be walking beside me today.

619
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,711
There's a Detective Jimenez.

620
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,268
He just showed me a video,
my husband's PDA.

621
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,434
It was his last living moment
before he killed himself.

622
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,514
He addressed it to me,

623
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,352
but I need to see it again.

624
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,711
Can you please help me?

625
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,518
That would be in Homicide.

626
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,678
You don't strike me as a man
having trouble getting around.

627
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,671
-Mrs McKay, you shouldn't...
-Julia.

628
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,757
Please, call me Julia.

629
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,353
You should let the investigation
take its course, Julia.

630
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,352
If it helps you through this difficult time,

631
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,038
I'll see about the video.

632
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,156
-Thank you, Alvaro.
-Okay.

633
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:53,276
I'll see you in hell, baby.

634
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,757
You got time to take
a look at something... Sorry.

635
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,553
It's a mess, but the bulk will soon be gone.

636
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,669
Look.

637
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,596
I was about to pack this.

638
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,469
Julia, I've been to the movies.

639
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,839
A microphone.

640
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,510
Listen, put this back where it was.

641
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,273
All I need you to get
is the photos and the press clippings.

642
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,591
Leave everything else as is. This is serious.

643
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,716
-You did good.
-Thank you.

644
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,394
All right, I have to go.
I have to see the man about insurance.

645
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,595
Okay.

646
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,038
-Hi.
-Mrs McKay.

647
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,919
My sympathies.

648
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,953
Please. Late breakfast? Early lunch?

649
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,110
No, thanks. I'm short for time.

650
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,953
Well, as you know,
I'm the keeper of your key man policy,

651
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,793
and I'm here to monitor the results
of the investigation...

652
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,348
-Yes.
-...to ensure that should events take a turn

653
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,396
-for the better...
-The better?

654
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,111
Should your husband's death
not be ruled a suicide,

655
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,829
my company will pay the benefit,
which is five million euros.

656
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,230
I'm aware of the policy,
but the benefits aren't of my concern.

657
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,470
It's how I'm going to sleep at night.

658
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:06,076
My interest in the investigation
is solely to please my client, Mrs McKay.

659
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,789
Now your performance in the
interrogation room was quite convincing.

660
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,991
Do you have any other thoughts to offer?

661
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:17,596
I'm sure it'd please you and your company
if my husband's death was ruled a suicide,

662
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,796
therefore you wouldn't have to
pay off the policy.

663
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,677
Mrs McKay, please...

664
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,988
Chuck, right?

665
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,595
Do you mind if I call you Chuck?

666
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,078
I know it must be difficult for you
to deal with my tragedy.

667
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,835
But I am determined to find
out if this was a murder or a suicide,

668
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,435
and to tell you the truth, Chuck,
I hope it is a murder.

669
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,877
Mrs McKay, you're gonna give me
indigestion here.

670
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,635
To all of you, my sympathies.

671
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:54,356
I am Natalia Mylar
and I am presiding over the probate period.

672
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:01,354
It is not my intention or position to question
the lack of propriety in this matter,

673
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,477
but from a formal standpoint,
there's little to review,

674
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,677
as Matthew McKay left behind
no formal will.

675
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:15,193
I hereby declare that the assets, the estate,
and all its contents

676
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,590
be left to his legal spouse, Julia McKay.

677
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,476
Thank you for attending.

678
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,753
I know how Matt took care of you
all of these years, and I fully approved of it.

679
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,956
Nothing will change, Rose.

680
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,393
Thank you.

681
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,280
Eva, can I speak with you, please?

682
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:50,070
It's been such a crazy day.
Everything's so up in the air, you know?

683
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,037
-You did a great job in here.
-Thank you.

684
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,032
I'm really looking forward
to moving to this office.

685
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,799
The boss with the big cojones
gets the corner.

686
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,359
But you seem a bit distracted.

687
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,113
-Can I tell you something in confidence?
-Sure.

688
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,517
They found a video
on the table at the condo.

689
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,669
It was on Matt's PDA.

690
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,838
It was left running.

691
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,115
It was his last living moments.

692
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,192
-And they also saw something else on it.
-On the video?

693
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,871
The video kept running for, like,
five more minutes

694
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,190
after he left me the message.

695
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,909
There was someone else
in the condo that night.

696
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,274
No.

697
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,110
I have a copy of it in the editing room.

698
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,795
I don't know who it was,
but the police have a copy, too.

699
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:35,516
So someone else was in the room
when he shot himself?

700
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,558
Yeah, but he must've shot himself
after the PDA ran out

701
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,836
because there was no gunshot on it.

702
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,952
My God, Julia.

703
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,509
Look, I don't mean to put this on you,
it's just that I have no one else to tell

704
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,636
and you're my only friend.

705
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,632
I'll let you get back to work.
I know you're busy.

706
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,269
No, it's okay. I'm just opening
a lot of those sympathy cards.

707
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,910
I'm gonna stay in the office late tonight.
I have a lot of catching up to do.

708
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,116
But if it's okay with you,
I'd like to stay at your house

709
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,758
because I don't want
to go back to the condo.

710
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,149
Yeah. I better catch up myself.

711
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,799
Thanks, Eva.

712
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,554
-How's homicide?
-Homicide's homicide.

713
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,074
One day, if you're lucky,
you'll work with the dead.

714
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,196
Better than working with
the scum that should be dead.

715
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,396
You don't want to be
among corpses too soon.

716
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,069
No.

717
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,752
The bitch drained our family, man.

718
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,751
Bobby, will you calm down?
What are you talking about?

719
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,400
-Matt didn't have a will, Trevor.
-Well, did you expect him to?

720
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,758
-She took the fucking cars, too, man.
-Bobby, that was just Matt's way.

721
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,274
-He expected to live forever.
-She needs to chill, Trevor.

722
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,318
Yes, perhaps she does,
but, Bobby, so do you.

723
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,919
Let's go talk about this in my office.

724
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,229
Hello, Julia.

725
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,436
Hi. I really need to see you.

726
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,795
I'm leaving the office now
and I was hoping that we could meet up.

727
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:54,915
It's about Trevor.

728
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,433
Yep. Julia?

729
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,794
Hello?

730
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,749
Shit!

731
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,713
Requesting back-up,
723 Diagonal Avenue.

732
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,872
Advantage Ad Agency,
requesting back-up, thank you.

733
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,077
What's the matter, Julia?

734
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,434
You looking for a way down?

735
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,153
I know of one.

736
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,269
Over the top.

737
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,034
I've got her. Get the car, I'll be right down.

738
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,272
Hey, did you hear?

739
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,595
I hear Julia had this terrible accident.

740
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,995
Or was it suicide?

741
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:35,316
Maybe something just drove her to it, huh?

742
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,431
Come here, you stupid bitch!

743
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,078
Are you scared?

744
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,512
No! Help me! Someone!

745
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,312
Help! No, please don't.

746
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,039
Please don't do it.

747
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,873
-No, please.
-This little piggy went to the market...

748
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,671
And this little piggy fell off the roof.

749
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:57,829
No, please.

750
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,955
Excuse me.

751
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:51,670
There's a body in the alley,
two others left in a car.

752
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:52,995
Anyone else?

753
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,314
Don't think so.

754
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,798
So now you're in the
advertising business?

755
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,390
Guy in back is Bobby McKay,

756
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,832
on my radar for trafficking.

757
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,070
He works here.

758
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,509
She was the target.

759
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,432
I'll hear your statement later.

760
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,519
Thank you.

761
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,394
I called you because I saw the video.

762
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,714
There was someone else in the room.

763
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,879
I found a microphone in Matt's office.

764
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,517
Trevor was monitoring his calls
right before he died.

765
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,315
You think Trevor was in the condo?

766
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,198
I left the videotape out and he took it.

767
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,635
Now he knows that I know
someone else was in the house.

768
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,955
You think he wants to kill you?

769
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:14,033
If he knows that I know
someone else was in the house

770
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,671
and I think it was him,

771
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,835
yes.

772
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:29,310
-Can you describe Trevor's car?
-An Audi sedan. Why?

773
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,676
There's an Audi sedan parked
300 metres behind you.

774
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,196
I can't see who's inside,

775
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,033
but we can walk that way
and see if it moves.

776
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,670
Do you believe me now?

777
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,998
We have to stop him before he stops you.

778
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,355
Should we work on this together?

779
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,799
Jimenez wants to make peace.

780
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,270
I guess he figures
you'll get this anyway,

781
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,518
ballistics and gun registration.

782
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,990
Matt McKay was
killed with his own gun.

783
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,469
Thank you, Anna.

784
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,559
Julia, it's time to proceed.

785
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,032
Look, I know I've been a bitch lately

786
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:43,476
and I haven't been listening to you,
and I want to.

787
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,391
I'd like it if we could sit back down

788
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,074
and go over the clients
and review company policy.

789
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:53,956
Well, yeah. That would be great, yes.
I'd like to very much.

790
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,751
Well, I think that this weekend
I'm gonna go away to the cottage

791
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,876
and just relax, you know?

792
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,870
Yes. Yes, I think you should.

793
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,550
I'd like if you joined me.

794
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,599
I know I could really use the company.

795
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,558
We could make dinner,
drink some wine, relax.

796
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:14,508
You know, go over the new plan
and then come Monday morning,

797
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,958
-we'll start anew, you know?
-Well, yeah.

798
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,994
That sounds great. Yes, I'd love to.

799
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:26,716
-Good.
-I haven't seen the cottage yet, you know.

800
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,439
Okay, well, hasta manana.

801
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,589
Running short on suspects, Anna.

802
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,757
Know what I think?
She provoked him.

803
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,998
She didn't expect
things to go that far,

804
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,596
but she wanted grounds for divorce,
and a big settlement, of course.

805
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:49,117
But she didn't break any laws,
and his prints are on the gun.

806
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,111
It's a suicide.

807
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,710
I couldn't do what you're doing, Julia.

808
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,319
You already are.

809
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,312
You know what I mean.
I wasn't born with that.

810
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,512
Yeah, well, look where it got me.
I have a man trying to kill me.

811
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,189
But please, Julia. Don't do anything...

812
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,429
Don't worry.

813
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,159
It's gonna be fine.

814
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:26,035
Now I need you to go set up
and show me how brave you are.

815
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,189
Okay.

816
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,553
Yes, o.k. o.k. o.k.

817
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,073
Alvaro needs back-up
in the Pyrenees.

818
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,838
When?

819
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,269
4 p.m., details will come later.

820
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,600
There goes our weekend...

821
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,276
It had to be him.

822
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,789
He's crossing all the lines.

823
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,518
Exactly.

824
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,709
Hello? Anybody home?

825
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,640
Yeah, come on in. I'll be right out.

826
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,915
-Hi. You got here early.
-No traffic.

827
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,754
-Want to go for a walk?
-Oh, I'd love to, yes. Sure.

828
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,239
See your domain, huh?

829
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,550
Okay, let me go get my jacket.

830
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,513
Easy to appreciate.

831
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,354
Yeah, the only thing that changes
is the time of year you look at it.

832
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:59,077
Matt used to love it up here.
Especially the sunsets.

833
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,639
I'm sure.

834
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,789
What do you think of Matt's last words?

835
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:09,513
-Last words?
-On the video.

836
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:14,638
-Jimenez didn't show it to you?
-No. No, Jimenez didn't.

837
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,638
It doesn't matter.

838
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,791
So what did you see on the video?

839
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,919
I told you, I didn't see the video.

840
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,878
Where the fuck are you going
with this, Julia?

841
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,598
Let's just go back to the cottage.

842
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,029
No.

843
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,074
I would rather stay here with the view.

844
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,277
So what did you see on the video?

845
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,313
I saw a man that looked exactly like you.

846
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,432
You know, Matt had that gun.

847
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,992
Why is that gun being pointed
at me, Trevor?

848
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,314
You know.

849
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:06,392
-I know what?
-You know enough to put me away.

850
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,677
And who said I'm gonna tell?

851
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,873
Start walking.

852
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,272
It was you.

853
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,795
Yes, I went to the condo.

854
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,473
I saw your stupid, fucked-up husband.

855
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,957
He didn't even have the guts to kill himself.

856
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,949
It wasn't difficult to give him his gun back.

857
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,711
Say bye-bye and take two steps backwards.

858
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,994
Trevor!

859
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,636
It's over! Drop the weapon.

860
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,354
Do you see this?

861
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,830
This is what you used
on my fucked-up husband.

862
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,717
Drop the weapon now!

863
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,318
I'm recording everything.

864
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,630
Now! Drop it!

865
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,999
I'd be careful where I go with this, Alvaro.

866
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,113
Remember our little meeting on the bluffs,

867
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:26,034
where you took the money
and agreed to kill Xavi

868
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,119
and take out Julia?

869
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,952
You're trying to place me
where I wasn't, Trevor.

870
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:35,114
No, no. I'm just telling you I have
a collection of very interesting recordings.

871
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,430
-Can you prove it?
-Of course.

872
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,275
Isn't it just like Trevor Jones
to cover his hairy ass?

873
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,990
Now, who should we
be killing here, Alvaro, huh?

874
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:51,595
You arrest me, and we'll be taking showers
together in the morning,

875
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,238
passing the fucking soap.

876
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,878
Don't believe him, Alvaro.

877
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,072
It's obvious she has to go.

878
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,072
I'm sorry, Julia.

879
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,517
But now it's about my life.

880
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,715
Don't.

881
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,191
I'm not going to push you.

882
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,950
You know that I bury my bodies.

883
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,189
No!

884
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,511
-Fuck! Where the fuck is she?
-I don't know.

885
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,119
Let's go.

886
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,514
Where'd she go? Well, where is she?

887
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,352
On your fucking knees.
On your fucking knees!

888
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,080
One chance, or you will die.

889
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,196
Where is the recording?

890
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,591
Walk about 10 metres.

891
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,996
I'll be starting to fire,

892
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,998
Iike I caught you chasing Julia.

893
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,675
I'll get them. I'll burn them!
Just don't shoot, okay?

894
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,954
Where?

895
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,989
-Where are they?
-ln my fucking office in the fucking safe.

896
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,270
What else do you fucking want?

897
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:27,469
Julia...

898
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,669
You wouldn't.

899
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:10,593
What happened?

900
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,353
Mrs McKay?

901
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,279
Are you okay, Julia?

902
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,238
Where is Alvaro?

903
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,075
It's okay.

904
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,515
Stay with her,
you come with me.

905
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,999
Julia. Julia.

906
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,788
-You're a brave girl.
-Thank you. See you in a minute, okay?

907
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,150
"Julia, Congratulations!
Don't spend it all in one restaurant! Chuck"
