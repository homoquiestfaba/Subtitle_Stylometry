1
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,559
Somebody's pullin' me close to the ground.

2
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,116
I can sense, but I can't see.

3
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,273
I ain't panicked. I been here before.

4
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,313
Same as when I got popped
on 104th Street.

5
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,068
Don't take me to no hospital, please.

6
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,839
Fuckin' emergency rooms
don't save nobody.

7
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,469
Son of a bitches always pop you
at midnight...

8
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,030
...when all they got is a Chinese intern
with a dull spoon.

9
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,711
Look at these suckers scramblin' around.
What for?

10
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,796
My Puerto Rican ass ain't supposed
to have made it this far.

11
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,432
Most of my crew got washed
a long time ago.

12
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,478
Don't worry. My heart, it don't ever quit.

13
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,711
I ain't ready to check out.

14
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,954
Seems like I just got out of thejoint.

15
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,159
Stood up in front of that judge,
and told him what was who.

16
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,197
Now I ain't sayin' that my way
would have been different...

17
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,518
...had my mother been alive when I was
a kid, 'cause that's all you hear in the joint.

18
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,354
"I didn't have a chance." No. Bullshit.

19
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,549
I was already a mean little bastard
while my mother was alive, and I know it.

20
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,392
But I learned about women from her.

21
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,155
Mr. Brigante, there are 56 cases
on the court's docket for this morning.

22
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,673
Why am I listening to this?

23
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,360
Your Honor, Mr. Brigante
is understandably excited...

24
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,318
...having been vindicated
after five years of incarceration.

25
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,197
There's no vindication here, counselor.

26
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,880
Or absolution, or benediction,
or anything...

27
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,634
...other than an incredible
convergence of circumstances...

28
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,075
...which you've exploited
to your client's benefit.

29
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,549
Your Honor, these circumstances
that you speak of...

30
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,359
...include illegal wiretaps
and tainted evidence.

31
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,398
This is a classic
"fruit of the poisoned tree" situation.

32
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,994
I think after five years
of unjust incarceration...

33
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,868
...it's reasonable to request Mr. Brigante
be indulged his right to speak.

34
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,110
Okay, Mr. Brigante, I'm all ears.

35
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,439
Your Honor...

36
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,672
...with all due respect...

37
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,352
...past and present,
and without further to-do.

38
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,436
Let me assure this court that
I am through walkin' on the wild side.

39
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,351
That's all I've been tryin' to tell you.

40
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,837
I have been sick with the social ills
known in the ghetto...

41
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,876
...but my time in the sterling
correctional facilities...

42
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,558
...of Green Haven and Sing Sing
has not been in vain. I've been cured!

43
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,795
Born again, like the Watergaters.

44
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,350
I know you heard this rap before.
Your Honor, I mean it.

45
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,756
This is the truth. I changed.

46
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,392
I changed and it didn't take no 30 years...

47
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,631
...like Your Honor thought, but only five.

48
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,794
That's right, sir. Five years.

49
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,237
And look at me. Completely rehabilitated...

50
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,998
...reinvigorated, reassimilated,
and finally gonna be relocated.

51
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,435
And I want to thank
a lot of people for that.

52
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,159
I look over there and I see
that man there, Mr. Norwalk.

53
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,194
I want to thank you, sir,
for making the tapes in an illegal fashion.

54
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,279
I would like to thank the Court of Appeals
for reversing you, Your Honor.

55
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,432
And I want to thank...

56
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,638
...AImighty God, without whom
no case gets tossed.

57
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,549
- I can't believe this.
- I must have forgot. How could I forget...

58
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,038
...my dear, close friend and lawyer...

59
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,390
...David Kleinfeld,
who never gave up on me...

60
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,552
...through everything, thick and thin.

61
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,393
- Why don't you just stand up?
- I'm sorry.

62
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,188
- Mr. Brigante!
- Davey Kleinfeld.

63
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,675
You're not accepting an award.

64
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,798
Court of Appeals' decision...

65
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,113
...and the District Attorney's
unfortunate investigative techniques...

66
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,955
...now devolve upon me the painful duty
of unleashing upon society...

67
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,271
...a reputed assassin
and convicted purveyor of narcotics.

68
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,392
No. Never convicted on no dope.

69
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,115
The indictment is dismissed.
Prisoner is discharged. Call the next case.

70
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,876
- I'm indebted to you.
- Okay.

71
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,668
I feel like I won.

72
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,716
Excuse me. Congratulations.

73
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,791
- No hard feelings, right?
- I'll be seeing you, Brigante.

74
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,310
That was some line of crap
you handed him in there.

75
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,910
That was no line of crap, man.
I meant every word I said.

76
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,189
You don't understand. You don't get it.

77
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,080
I'm a free man,
and I don't mean just out of jail.

78
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,914
"I am free at last, free at last...

79
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,560
- "...thank God Almighty, I am free at last!"
- I gotta work here. Save your energy.

80
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,029
Wait till you see what I got
lined up for tonight.

81
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,036
So what are you gonna do for money?
Hook up with Rolando again?

82
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,038
I told you, I ain't goin' back to the street.

83
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,990
Twenty-five years I worked that sucker.

84
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,516
What do I got to show for it? Squat.

85
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,068
You dancing with me
or you dancing with him?

86
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,999
What does that mean,
"I ain't goin' back on the street"?

87
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,230
What else do you know how to do?

88
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,514
- I got plans, baby.
- Talk to me.

89
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,997
'Cause you can dance
with him if you wanna.

90
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,798
I know Dave since he was
just out of law school.

91
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,392
He was workin' as a clerk
for a big mob lawyer.

92
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,039
Kept a tire iron under the seat of his car,
tried like hell not to look scared...

93
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,111
...by all his wise guy clients.

94
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,872
But Davey Kleinfeld,
he ain't scared no more.

95
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,559
So look at you.

96
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,836
You really made something of your life.

97
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,117
You put me in business.
All my first clients came through you.

98
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,470
As I say, you know, top drawer.

99
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,671
You're top drawer, Davey.

100
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,548
Man.

101
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,995
Listen, I got something for you.
You remember Saso?

102
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,833
Saso. Yeah.

103
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,036
Fat guy, had the Argentine place
on Madison.

104
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,113
He bought the lease on this bankrupt disco.
Beautiful place.

105
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,350
I got some investors together
and we backed him.

106
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,237
I got $50,000 in the place.

107
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,710
Problem is Saso. He's been shakin' the till,
payin' off gambling debts.

108
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,792
He says he doesn't get $25,000,
he's gonna lose his lease.

109
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,275
I like the place. I go there sometimes.

110
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,920
The money's no big deal.
I don't mind puttin' it in...

111
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,959
...as long as I know there's someone there
who's gonna run the place straight, clean.

112
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,269
Me?

113
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,509
I owned clubs. I never ran 'em.

114
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,640
What's the big deal?
You step in, straighten things out...

115
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,473
...you take a salary, a chunk of the profits.
- Please.

116
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,549
You've done enough already for me.

117
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,910
You call it a favor between friends.

118
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,758
No favor. I owe you.

119
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,669
Favor gonna kill you faster than a bullet.

120
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,112
You saved my life.

121
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,952
You saved my life, Dave.

122
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,756
Thirty years. You know what that is?

123
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,399
I was dead. I was buried.
I was under the ground.

124
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,074
You dug me up.

125
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,835
I don't know what to say to you.

126
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,798
I just don't know what to say.

127
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,279
Say you love me.

128
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,109
I love you.

129
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,993
If you was a broad, I'd marry you.

130
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,911
- My boy.
- I bet you would.

131
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,469
Who's that? Well, you know...

132
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,231
Look, we're going to the ladies' room.

133
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,075
Goodbye, you two.

134
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,390
- Well, somebody's got to.
- Bye-bye.

135
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,956
So, what are these plans?

136
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,075
What's the big goddamn secret?

137
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,834
You remember a guy named Clyde Bassie?

138
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,316
Got out of the joint a couple of years ago.

139
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,669
He went down to the Bahamas,
Paradise Island...

140
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,429
...and he got this car rental place.

141
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,069
He used to talk about it
all the time in the can.

142
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,998
He got out, he went down there,
put it together.

143
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,072
And it's doin' good. Real good.

144
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,915
I mean, like, it's makin' money.

145
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,509
Couple of months ago
he wrote me and he said...

146
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,476
...I could buy in any time
I got $75,000 together.

147
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,118
You're gonna rent cars.

148
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,072
What are you laughing at?

149
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,717
- You're gonna rent cars.
- That's right. I know a lot about cars.

150
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,355
I've been stealing 'em since I was 14.

151
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,633
Look at him laugh.

152
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,472
I'll tell you something.

153
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,078
Car rental guys don't get killed that much.

154
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,154
And where are you gonna get the $75,000?

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,310
I don't know. Maybe some rich relative
dies and leaves it to me.

156
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,998
It's a dream, Dave. You gotta dream, baby.

157
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,874
You got it all worked out, Carlito.
Here's to you.

158
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,597
So here's me back on the street.

159
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,079
Third Sunday in August.
Old Timer's Day in the barrio.

160
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,799
- When did you get out, papi?
- A couple of days ago.

161
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,388
Nothin' left.

162
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,519
Like them old cowboy movies,
but instead of tumbleweed and cow dung...

163
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,559
...we got stripped car wrecks and dog shit.

164
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,712
A lot of new faces?

165
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,999
These young guys, I don't recognize 'em.

166
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,391
Mi barrio ya no existe.

167
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,079
Carlito, man, Death Valley out here, man.

168
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,268
Mira, you know me, I take to the street
with any of these motherfuckers, man.

169
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,996
But these new kids nowadays, man,
they got no respect for human life.

170
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,753
They shotgun you,
just to see you fly up in the air.

171
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,831
'Chacho, you're better off in jail.

172
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,996
I don't even go
up to black Harlem no more.

173
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,753
They're fuckin' crazy up there.
Remember Victor?

174
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,312
- Victor, with the beard.
- He got shot right in front of the High.

175
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,834
Right in front of fuckin' Patrick Henry High.

176
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,918
- Y Lalin, you know him.
- Lalin Miasso. What happened to him?

177
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,595
Lalin's doin' thirty years in Attica, man.
Thirty years!

178
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,474
Walberto! Check it out. Mira who's here.

179
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,511
- Mira, eso. Oye.
- Hey, Wally.

180
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,353
- Heavy-duty.
- Good to see you.

181
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,274
I've been looking all over for you.

182
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,519
Should have figured
I'd find you walking around up here...

183
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,036
...doing a little "memory lane."
- While I still got one.

184
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,954
- Mira, Rolando wants to talk to you.
- Carlito, I gotta get back to the game.

185
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,759
You need anything, bodyguard,
anything, call me, okay?

186
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,434
- You call me. Take care.
- Pachanga. Good to see you.

187
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,918
- Rolando?
- Si. He's around the corner.

188
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,594
Guajiro, wait here for me.

189
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,274
- In about five minutes, I'll be back.
- Sure, Carlito.

190
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,710
Who is that? New back-up man?

191
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,479
He's my little cousin.
I gotta visit my aunt later.

192
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,752
Carlito, mi socio.

193
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,753
Que chevere!

194
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,840
I said a prayer for you
while you were inside...

195
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,474
...that harm will come
to him who harmed you.

196
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,035
- Thank you.
- Sientate. Sit down.

197
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,835
- You are well?
- Well enough.

198
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,516
You look like you're doing good
for yourself.

199
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,956
Why not? Business is good.

200
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,393
- Smack.
- The coca business.

201
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,554
That's all there is. Heroin is dead.

202
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,317
- But you know all of this, right?
- No, I didn't know that.

203
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,435
Let's speak the truth between us.

204
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,238
You did five years
and never once mentioned my name.

205
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,792
I know that you could have given me up...

206
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,397
...and made things easier for yourself,
but you didn't.

207
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,756
Muy bien hecho. Good for you.

208
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,038
But you see I got rich
while you were inside.

209
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,715
Maybe you think I owe you?

210
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,070
I don't want anything from you.

211
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,670
- Who are you working with?
- I ain't working with nobody.

212
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,554
- Nobody?
- I'm retired.

213
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,878
- Retired?
- That's right.

214
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,354
Retired?

215
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,629
You're serious?

216
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,393
I'm serious. That's right. I'm out. I quit.

217
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,636
So, Carlito Brigante got religion, right?

218
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,394
That's right. I'm studying to be a priest.

219
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,318
So what are you doing these days?

220
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,278
Nothing much. I'm still in school.

221
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,757
I got a job though.

222
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,592
No kidding. Doing what?

223
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,638
Just a little legwork
for Senor Pablo Cabrales.

224
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,672
- Cabrales.
- Yeah.

225
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,798
What do you want to do that shit for?
That's not good.

226
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,718
Come on, Carlito.
I'm not making a career out of it.

227
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,950
I'm a delivery boy, that's all.

228
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,679
Check this out.

229
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,838
That's $30,000.

230
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,516
Can I ask you for a favor?

231
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,635
What's that?

232
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,150
I gotta go down the block for this pickup.
Can you come with me?

233
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,710
Come on. Don't get me involved
with that stuff.

234
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,394
Come on. I know these guys.
They're friends.

235
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,038
I just wanna walk in with you.

236
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,237
They see my back-up
and they'll shit in their pants.

237
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,989
- They ain't gonna know me.
- You?

238
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,036
You're a fuckin' legend.

239
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,915
Come on.

240
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,836
All right. 10 minutes. I promised
your mother we'd be there for dinner.

241
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,434
That's no problem.
These guys, they're real pros.

242
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,953
Boom, boom, in and out.

243
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,114
So the kid's walkin' in there with $30,000.

244
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,875
And the legend, me,
I'm walkin' right in with him.

245
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,428
Five minutes from now
we'll be on the streets...

246
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,159
...with $30,000 worth of very sweet candy...

247
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,755
...more than enough to put me
right back where I just come from.

248
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,390
- Como esta?
- Oye, Quisqueya. Que pasa?

249
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,438
Cono, Guajiro. Who's this?

250
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,717
This is my cousin, man.
Primo mio, Carlito Brigante.

251
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,912
You heard of Carlito, right?

252
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,237
What you need him for?

253
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,075
Tranquilo, tranquilo.
I just come along for the ride, man.

254
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,668
Come on, Quisqueya, man.
You know Carlito, right?

255
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,671
I got nothing here.

256
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,590
He just got out of Lewisburg, man.

257
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,434
He used to be partners with Rolando Rivas.

258
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,355
Carlito. I heard of you, man.

259
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,797
You used to run smack
with Rolando, right?

260
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,634
Little bit.

261
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,394
Little bit? Little bit, that's a good one.

262
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,313
I heard you guys were the fucking kings.

263
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,358
Lo siento, Carlito.

264
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,473
Hermanos, take care of Carlito.

265
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,476
We gotta do some business.

266
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,114
Hermanito.

267
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,434
- Quierejugar?
- No, I'll watch.

268
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,678
- We're playing eight ball.
- Good game.

269
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,191
- You don't mind if I count it, right?
- It's all there, man.

270
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,272
I'll count it anyway.

271
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,234
- Maybe you'll lose a game.
- Right.

272
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,509
- You like that shot I did, right?
- That shot ain't nothin'.

273
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,028
Come on.

274
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,680
What're you in a rush for?
I'll beat you again.

275
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,071
- Damn it!
- What's the matter?

276
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,356
- That's your bathroom there?
- That's the bathroom.

277
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,994
Don't work.

278
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,632
The toilet's backed up.

279
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,799
Sorry, man.

280
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,635
- Don't work?
- No, don't work.

281
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,397
I can wait another week.

282
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,118
Come back then, we'll have it fixed for you.

283
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,475
Turn it up! I love that song!

284
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,996
Mira, you wanna play or what?

285
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,830
Be cool. I'm rackin', man. Shit.

286
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,995
- You got a light?
- Sure, man.

287
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,271
- You're playin' eight ball, right?
- Yeah.

288
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,318
I can't resist this.
I gotta show you people a shot.

289
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,796
- We're in the middle of a game here!
- You're playin' eight ball.

290
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,509
Right before you rack. It's nothin'.
It ain't gonna bother your game.

291
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,753
You ain't gonna believe this.
Gonna line 'em up like this.

292
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,793
- You gonna show us a trick shot?
- No trick shot. This is magic time.

293
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,954
After you see this shot,
you're gonna give up your religious beliefs.

294
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,191
Quisqueya, you gotta check this out.

295
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,272
- Carlito's doin' one of his trick shots.
- Guajiro.

296
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,716
I ain't done counting yet.

297
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,635
You want a cold beer, hermano?

298
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,918
Help yourself, man.

299
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,554
- Took me six months to learn this shot.
- Six months?

300
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,756
- You gotta help me though.
- Sure.

301
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,235
See this?

302
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,719
- Over the 12.
- Okay.

303
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,555
- So how's your boss?
- He's good. I saw him this morning.

304
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,438
Put your finger right here,
right on top of the 12, to hold it there, see?

305
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,433
- Like that?
- You gotta get it even with that.

306
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,229
- So you didn't hear the news?
- What news?

307
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,670
There's no beer down here, man.

308
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,916
Sure, way down in the bottom.

309
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,874
Me and Clyde Bassie were working on this.

310
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,918
You lookin' at that nine?
Let me have your cue.

311
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,909
Line 'em up.

312
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,635
- They even?
- They look even to me.

313
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,320
Come on, Quisqueya. What news?

314
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,391
Your boss is dead and so are you.

315
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,673
I'm reloaded!

316
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,470
Come on in here, motherfuckers!

317
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,796
Come on, I'm waitin' for ya!

318
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,393
You ain't comin' in?

319
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,673
I'm comin' out!

320
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,433
You're up against it now, motherfuckers!

321
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,799
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' brains out!

322
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,836
You think you're big time?

323
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,029
You're gonna fuckin' die big time!

324
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,559
You ready?

325
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,992
Here comes the pain!

326
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,554
Oh, Jesus.

327
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,316
Jesus Christ, look at you.

328
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,594
You said they were friends, Guajiro...

329
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,837
...but there ain't no friends
in this shit business.

330
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,273
Adios, primo.

331
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,952
All right, what happened?

332
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,396
Ain't no more rackets out here...

333
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,393
...just a bunch of cowboys
ripping each other off.

334
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,550
I don't invite this shit. It just comes to me.

335
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,910
I run, it runs after me.

336
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,556
Gotta be somewhere to hide.

337
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,676
So I took a look at this, Saso's place.
It's good. It's a nice location.

338
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,197
Somebody ran it right,
it could do good business.

339
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,995
Great. I'll advance you $25,000.

340
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,029
No, I'm gonna put my own money in.

341
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,068
Your own money? What money is that?

342
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,039
I ran into Rolando.
He owed me from an old thing, $25,000...

343
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,318
...so, that's the only way
I'm gonna do it, Dave.

344
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,998
You got it. Terrific.

345
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,188
So you'll call Saso,
tell him I'll see him tonight.

346
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,796
Done. I want to talk to you
about something. I need a little favor.

347
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,230
It's no big deal, but I need a bodyguard.
Somebody good.

348
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,471
Who's bothering you? I know 'em?

349
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,068
It's no big deal.
Just a little misunderstanding.

350
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,720
If it's no big deal,
what do you need a bodyguard for?

351
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,389
Will you trust me on this?
It's just temporary.

352
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,029
I'll get someone of my own later,
but I want someone right away.

353
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,151
There's Pachanga,
one of the old barrio crowd. He's good.

354
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,475
Great.

355
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,839
You okay?

356
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,591
I got a good feeling about this club.

357
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,069
I think we're gonna make
some real money.

358
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,590
I got a good feeling about it too...

359
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,796
...but as soon as I make my $75,000...

360
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,273
...I'm splittin'.

361
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,199
That's right.

362
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,831
You're gonna rent Ford Pintos
to tourists in Paradise.

363
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,798
That's right,
with a big smile on my face, too.

364
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,438
Times have changed.

365
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,831
What happened to the miniskirts?

366
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,956
Where's all that marijuana?

367
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,830
Now everything is platforms, cocaine,
and dances I don't dance.

368
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,637
What a man gotta come to
when he loses five years.

369
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,757
But some shit never changes, like Saso.

370
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,994
Charlie, my friend! Charlie Brigante!
How you doing?

371
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,394
Hey, Saso.

372
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,677
No, no more Saso.
Now everybody calls me Ron.

373
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,594
- Ron?
- Ron from Reinaldo.

374
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,349
Okay, Ron, let's get to the point.

375
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,309
I hear you're doing good business
with this place.

376
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,630
- Very good.
- So how come you need money?

377
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,070
- Me?
- You gamblin' again, right?

378
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,559
How much you owe?

379
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,354
I don't know, maybe $50,000 or $60,000.

380
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,638
That means about $100,000.
Who you owe the money to?

381
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,836
You know, Charles, some of the boys.

382
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,676
$25,000 will quiet them for now,
and you'll come in for a quarter of my end.

383
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,749
Okay, I'm gonna give you
$25,000 cash tomorrow.

384
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,116
I'm gonna come in for half your end.

385
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,512
What are you trying to do to me?

386
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,957
What I'm trying to do, Saso,
I mean Ron, is save your ass.

387
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,873
Right, because it's either Fat Anthony
or Scooze you owe the money to, right?

388
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,758
Either way, you're gonna end up
in the trunk of a car...

389
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,035
...somewhere on the Belt Parkway
before long.

390
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,192
May be weeks before they find you.
Like DeeDee.

391
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,510
Remember? They open her up.

392
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,349
That's some kind of stink
you're gonna make.

393
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,117
"What's that smell?" Saso, man.

394
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,919
That's Saso. Used to be Ron.

395
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,875
Okay, okay. What time tomorrow?

396
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,234
So here's me in the club
playing Humphrey Bogart.

397
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,918
Things can get very sticky after hours,
so I bring in Pachanga...

398
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,998
...little extra back-up.

399
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,236
He thinks I'm gonna make him rich...

400
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,432
...so he's worried I'm gonna get killed
before he scores.

401
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,193
I heard about that shit with your cousin.

402
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,748
Why didn't you call me
so I could watch your ass?

403
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,400
That happened a month ago.
You just found out?

404
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,836
You got me chasin' Kleinberg
in the daytime and then you got me here...

405
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,913
Kleinfeld! I hope you're doin' a better job
with him than you are with me.

406
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,633
The guy got a lot of money.

407
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,951
He got a safe in the office
with stacks of hundreds just waitin'...

408
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,918
Kleinfeld is my brother. Look at me.

409
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,558
He is my brother.

410
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,637
Pachanga's only fuckin' around.

411
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,836
Don't fuck around.
Just keep your eyes open.

412
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,672
Watch the bar. They're stealin' money.

413
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,911
I wanna try, but it's so dark in here.
What do you want me to do?

414
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,433
The guy over there says
he don't have to pay.

415
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,798
- What guy is that?
- The guy in the red over there.

416
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,109
What are you doin'?

417
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,555
- Shut up and kiss me.
- Excuse me.

418
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,675
- Something wrong with the check?
- Yeah, there's something wrong with it.

419
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,751
- Baby, come on...
- Mira!

420
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,437
- Benny!
- What, man?

421
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,913
Shit. Fuck. Shit, man.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brigante.

422
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,956
I'm sorry. I got no problem.

423
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,749
See, Fat Man Saso there owes me money
and he's a little slow in paying me.

424
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,230
So I'm just working it off for him.
We haven't been formally introduced.

425
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,551
- My name is Benny Blanco from the Bronx.
- You know me?

426
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,916
I know you. You're Carlito Brigante,
motherfucker-to-the-max.

427
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,154
I don't know you.
So I don't owe you. Saso does.

428
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,750
My place now, new rules.

429
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,430
Everybody pays. Okay?

430
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,998
Okay. That's cool, that's groovy.

431
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,868
What's the matter with you?
Pay the fuckin' goddamn check, bitch.

432
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,394
- To the waiter.
- To the waiter, you dumb fuck!

433
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,233
And get us some champagne,
some of that French shit.

434
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,188
Have a glass, man.

435
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,550
- No, thank you...
- I wanna pick your brain.

436
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,392
Get him a chair. The man is standing!

437
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,074
Get him a chair.
Get the stupid look off your face.

438
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,230
You know who this man is?

439
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,354
This man here, he's the fuckin' J.P. Morgan
of the smack business.

440
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,518
First time I ever heard that.

441
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,309
Come on, man. You had 90, 100 guys
on the street. Right?

442
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,073
- Something like that.
- I'm starting out small.

443
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,832
I'm just building my organization.

444
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,388
I'm refining it
and maximizing my potentialities.

445
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,994
I got my finger on some shit
that's about to explode.

446
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,752
If you can just give me two minutes...

447
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,877
- Maybe next time. All the best to ya.
- Two minutes of your time.

448
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,439
I'll talk to you again.

449
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,879
Just two minutes. That's all.

450
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,193
Fucking kids.

451
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,830
Move a couple of ounces,
think they're a big shot.

452
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,597
Make a few bucks while I'm in the joint,
I gotta respect 'em.

453
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,910
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck that shit.

454
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,472
Talk to me about this.

455
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,908
Carlito, I see you was talkin'
to Benny Blanco before.

456
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,518
Benny Blanco from the Bronx.

457
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,268
- They say he's comin' up in the world.
- Do they?

458
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,119
He's got a big future...

459
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,516
...if he can live past next week.

460
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,078
How come a good-Iookin' dude like you...

461
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,039
...doesn't have a woman?

462
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,112
Well, I guess I'm a workaholic.

463
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,112
What's the matter?

464
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,634
Don't you ever see nobody
you like in here?

465
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,878
Nobody but you, Stef.

466
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,031
Jesus, she looks like Gail.

467
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,319
Same color hair. The way she dances.

468
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,512
I met Gail a year before
I went into thejoint.

469
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,998
She was this dancer,
this artistic ballet-type...

470
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,595
...was gonna be a big Broadway star.

471
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,831
I guess she fell in love.

472
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,915
Me too. I swore I'd never break her heart,
but, you know, things happen.

473
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,592
I miss you, Gail.

474
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,951
When you're in thejoint
you spend all your time...

475
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,556
...dopin' out who you're gonna see
the first day you're out.

476
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,950
The second day. The third.

477
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,152
But then you get out, everybody's got
a different face than you remember.

478
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,832
Maybe you do too.

479
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,879
You pray for one face that didn't change.

480
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,950
One face that still knows you...

481
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,919
...looks at you the same way it always did.

482
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,636
I couldn't figure it out.
I couldn't get that thing to save my life.

483
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,312
- Bye, Gail.
- See you next week.

484
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,277
- I know you, lady.
- Buzz off.

485
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,235
Sure, you used to go out with that guy.

486
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,675
What's his name? That good-Iooking guy.

487
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,670
Yeah, Carlito Brigante. That's right.

488
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,199
Hello, Gail.

489
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,871
I was in the road company
of this show called Songbird last year.

490
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,309
I played the Governor's daughter.

491
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,353
It wasn't the lead, but it was a great part.

492
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,635
And I did this musical book show
last year in Vegas.

493
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,751
I hated the weather. You ever been there?

494
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,392
Vegas? Yeah.
So are you in something now?

495
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,596
I can come downtown and see you.

496
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,710
I'm just, you know, doing club dates
right now, mostly one-nighters though.

497
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,429
But I'm up for this play that goes this fall...

498
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,949
That's great.

499
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,993
You're livin' what
you always dreamed about.

500
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,233
I'm getting close.

501
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,756
I am getting close.
I'm not there yet, but it's okay.

502
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,357
What was it like inside?

503
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,839
No big thing.

504
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,636
A lot of push-ups. A lot of wasted time.

505
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,550
- You're out now.
- Yeah. Here I am.

506
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,798
Am I outta line? Just poppin' up like this
after all these years?

507
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,157
You still pissed at me?

508
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,238
What do you think?

509
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,796
You dumped me hard, Charlie.

510
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,960
Now you want to tell me
it was for my own good, right?

511
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,033
No, it was for mine. It was for mine.

512
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,839
It was for my own good.
I was doin' thirty years.

513
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,390
What was I supposed to do? I knew
you were gonna try and wait for me.

514
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,711
You were gonna visit me,
make me think about you all the time.

515
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,429
Now what was I supposed to do?
There I am sittin' in jail...

516
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,879
...wonderin' all the time where you are...

517
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,349
...what you're doin', who you're with.

518
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,551
That'd have drove me crazy.

519
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,030
It'd have killed me. Believe me.

520
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,672
Best to just cut it clean, you know?

521
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,950
Do my time with a clear head.

522
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,835
So, now what?

523
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,112
Now what? I don't know.
I'm here. I'm out.

524
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,231
For whatever that's worth.

525
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,355
What about this club of yours?

526
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,468
It's not my club, you know.
I just got a piece of it.

527
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,309
Just trying to make enough money...

528
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,110
With my luck,
somebody's gonna get shot...

529
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,397
...the cops are gonna come
and close it down, you know.

530
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,596
That doesn't sound like you.

531
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,551
It doesn't? Really?

532
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,670
You never talked like this before.

533
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,796
Never felt like this before.

534
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,112
It's a funny thing.

535
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,830
This guy, this counselor at Lewisburg...

536
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,275
...Mr. Seawald, once said to me:

537
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,237
"Charlie, you run out of steam.

538
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,836
"You can't sprint all the way.
You gotta stop sometime.

539
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,877
"You can't buck it forever.
It catches up to you.

540
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,039
"It gets you.

541
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,717
"You don't get reformed...

542
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,231
"...you just run out of wind."

543
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,873
I'd better go.

544
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,151
Can I call you sometime?

545
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,315
Why don't you let me call you?

546
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,758
- You know where to find me, right?
- Yeah.

547
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,508
You said you wouldn't break my heart.

548
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,510
I know. I'm sorry.

549
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,554
I'm sorry.

550
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,799
Good night.

551
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,869
Mr. Taglialucci to see his lawyer,
Mr. Kleinfeld.

552
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,308
Go ahead.

553
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,998
Tony, how are you?

554
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,276
- Okay, Jackson, beat it.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Taglialucci.

555
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,713
You look good.

556
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,034
Don't make me do it, Kleinfeld.
Just write this down, all right?

557
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,669
It's 555-5888.

558
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,916
That's my kid Frankie's
home phone number...

559
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,036
...and I'll tell you why in a minute.

560
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,514
Shut up!

561
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,075
I never liked you, Kleinfeld.
Not 'cause you're a Jew.

562
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,711
I know plenty of Jews.
It's 'cause you're a lyin' piece of shit.

563
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,158
Now, I give you a million bucks to make
a simple payoff and nothin' happens.

564
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,879
Look, I told your son
I gave Nicky the money personally.

565
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,952
If he decides to betray that
and testify against you anyway...

566
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,759
...I can hardly be...
- You look at my hands.

567
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,397
Now, you make me raise my voice
and I'll snap your neck like a bread stick.

568
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,794
You fuckin' phony.
What do you take me for?

569
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,350
Nicky never saw dollar one of my money.

570
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,478
My million bucks went straight
into your pockets.

571
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,515
- I personally...
- Don't fuckin' lie to me, you scumbag.

572
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,115
You lie to me again,
you're gonna end up in that river out there.

573
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,797
You think about this when you go out,
and you'll take a look down...

574
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,831
...and imagine what it'll feel like...

575
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,550
...slidin' around down the bottom with eels
and crabs crawlin' outta your eyeballs.

576
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,153
What do you want from me?

577
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,273
- I understand you got a boat.
- Yeah.

578
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,836
- You're gonna get me outta here.
- I'm doing every...

579
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,720
My entire office is devoted
to your appeal right now.

580
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,270
- I talked to the judge this morning.
- I ain't talkin' about no appeal.

581
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,794
I'm talkin' about you bustin' me outta here.

582
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,275
I'm a lawyer.

583
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,109
Listen, you lawyer-fuck,
I got a million-dollar credit with you.

584
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,638
My kid Frankie'll go with you
and keep an eye on you...

585
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,438
...make sure everything goes right.

586
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,239
You see that guard
that brought me in here?

587
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,519
He's been taken care of, and he's gonna
set it up to get me into the water.

588
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,072
All you gotta do is be there
with the boat to pick me up.

589
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,476
This is not exactly the kind of...

590
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,551
The contract's already down on you, pal.

591
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,191
The guys, the guns,
the lime pit's already dug.

592
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,398
You understand?
And from in here, just one button I push.

593
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:23,911
What?

594
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,309
Mr. Norwalk from
the District Attorney's office.

595
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,912
I said no calls!

596
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,513
No, he's here.

597
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,999
Mr. Kleinfeld?

598
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,158
Give me a second, please.

599
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,918
- Mr. Kleinfeld, are you there?
- Send him in.

600
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,078
How are you?

601
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,189
- Good to see you. Have a seat.
- Hope you don't mind. I was in the area.

602
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,556
Not at all. As a matter of fact,
I was about to call you.

603
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,829
Your problems aren't just
going to go away.

604
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,998
Here's me in the club countin' every dollar.

605
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:42,272
On top of the $25,000 I put in,
I already pulled out another $14,000.

606
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,039
$35,000 or $40,000 more,
and I'm gone, daddy, gone.

607
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,477
Two, maybe three months.

608
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,911
Just gotta mark time now...

609
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,395
...lie low, keep outta trouble...

610
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,951
...and off people's minds.

611
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,191
Lalin is here. In the office.

612
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,714
- Lalin?
- You wanna see him?

613
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,635
- You told me he was doin' thirty years.
- I guess he got out.

614
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,832
- How's he doin'?
- Not as good as you, but, you know...

615
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,638
I don't know what that means.

616
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,593
Lalin was a neighborhood guy,
real good-lookin' son of a bitch.

617
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,275
He used to work in
this private gamblingjoint on West 87th.

618
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,599
He was kind of a greeter for the place,
set guys up with broads.

619
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,914
Now anybody ask me about Lalin...

620
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,598
...I have to say, he's a stand-up guy.

621
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,839
- Look at you, man, look at you.
- Hey, hermano.

622
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,195
How you doin', man? What a place.

623
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,078
What happened to you?

624
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,756
What do you mean? You didn't hear?

625
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,351
I took a few in the back.

626
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,237
When the street's really mad at you,
she don't put you in a box...

627
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,311
...she puts you in one of these things.

628
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,236
- Tu quieres?
- No. I'm workin'.

629
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,710
- How about a drink? You want one?
- Like you wouldn't believe.

630
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,948
Pachanga, tell me what's goin' on up there.

631
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,673
Come on, man, tell me.

632
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,399
Take care, all right?

633
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,918
I seen that chick
you used to go around with.

634
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,399
The one from the Bahamas.

635
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,233
You know, la rubia.
The one that looks like my sister.

636
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,389
That's Gail.

637
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,078
I seen her in this show
on 48th and Broadway.

638
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,193
When was this?

639
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,759
Two weeks ago.
She was in this fantastic show.

640
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:53,073
I mean, like artistic, you know,
but a lot of talent.

641
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,876
That girl's got a lot of talent.

642
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,273
48th and Broadway?

643
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,591
Let me get another drink.

644
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,475
So, you back in business?

645
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,278
I'm retired, Lalin. Told you that.
No more business for me.

646
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,112
Come on. All them people in Lewisburg
and you're telling me you didn't connect?

647
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,559
I did a lot of reading.
Worked on my appeal, that kind of thing.

648
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,671
What about you? What is this?

649
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,315
Pachanga told me
you was doin' thirty years.

650
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,158
Yeah. Beat it.

651
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,830
You beat it? How'd you do that?

652
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,189
You know, like you, I did a lot of reading...

653
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,795
...and I worked with some guys,
some smart guys in the joint...

654
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,236
...and just beat it, that's all.

655
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,710
No shit. That's good.

656
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,955
Here's to you.

657
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,638
To you. "Free at last."

658
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,515
Listen, I'm in with some new people now.
Unos italianos, tu sabes.

659
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,160
They trust you.
They think you're a fuckin' guinea.

660
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,232
- Where are they from? Pleasant Avenue?
- Downtown.

661
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,318
Anyway, they got the money.
They got a lot of money.

662
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,518
Some heavy paper. They go up to $25,000
for a key, if it's good shit, you know.

663
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,435
They want regular street people,
gente del barrio. Old school all the way.

664
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,195
- Stand-up guys like us, right, Lalin?
- Old school, baby.

665
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,272
So what you say? You and me,
just like old times.

666
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,476
You bring the people you're with now.

667
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:34,270
I ain't with nobody. I told you that.
I ain't connected no more.

668
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,276
Come on, man!
You forget who you're talking to?

669
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,518
- Look at this.
- Wait a minute.

670
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,797
This how you beat your thirty years,
you piece of shit?

671
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,111
- Let me explain.
- I'll kill you, you motherfucker.

672
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,279
- Fuckin' push you in the fuckin' river!
- What the fuck is goin' on?

673
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,119
Wait a minute. Wait a fuckin' second!

674
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,194
You a fuckin' chivo, man?
You a fuckin' rat? I'll fuckin' kill him!

675
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,157
Let me kill him for you!

676
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,709
Let him fuckin' kill me! Fuck you!

677
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,348
Kill me, you motherfucker!
Look what I got!

678
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:25,395
I mean, look at me! You got everything!

679
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,438
I mean, come on!

680
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,948
Look what I gotta fucking go around with:
fucking diapers!

681
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,994
I got fucking diapers!
I shit in my pants every day!

682
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,071
I can't walk, I can't hump.

683
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,474
Go ahead and kill me, you cocksucker!

684
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,311
They made me do it, or they send me back.

685
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,312
I'm no good in the joint.
I'm in a fucking wheelchair.

686
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,111
- It wasn't even turned on.
- Who sent you? Listen to me now.

687
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,033
Who sent you?

688
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,714
- Who sent you, motherfucker?
- The D.A.

689
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,994
Norwalk?

690
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,633
- Norwalk?
- He got a hard-on for you, man.

691
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,069
Got a tip you were dealing again, big time.

692
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,628
I was dealing? Who told him that?

693
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,156
I been clean. I haven't made
one fuckin' move. Who told him that?

694
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,071
- I don't know.
- Who told him that?

695
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,549
Man, I swear to God, I don't know!

696
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,796
I would never give you up.
I would never do that.

697
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,518
I was gonna give you a signal.

698
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,195
It wasn't even turned on.
It's something else, man!

699
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,353
Look, let me...

700
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,194
Just do it, man! Just fuckin' kill me.

701
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,111
I ain't gonna kill you.

702
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,155
I ain't even gonna hurt you.

703
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,954
I ask you...

704
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,274
...how can you fuck the only people
who ever cared for you?

705
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,356
How do you do that?

706
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,957
You lost, motherfucker.

707
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,350
I'm gonna get somebody to wheel you out.

708
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,998
Dejame explicar...

709
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,477
Some fuck told Norwalk
I was dealin' again.

710
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,714
Come in.

711
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,637
Do you know who it was?

712
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,033
All I know is he sent somebody
to talk to me wearin' a wire.

713
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,832
That son of a bitch.

714
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,590
He's been leaning on me too,
about other shit.

715
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,878
I ain't dealin'. I ain't goin'
back to prison no matter what!

716
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,552
Relax. You're not dealing,
so he can't have anything on you.

717
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,389
This is the way this guy is.
He's on a goddamn fishing expedition.

718
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,153
I'll take care of it. All right? Come on.

719
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,598
Fuckin' Lalin, man.

720
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,474
He has nobody.

721
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,319
He has nobody left.

722
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,154
How about you, sir? Check it out, man.

723
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,399
What's up, man? Check it out.
What's happenin', man?

724
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,755
Cool, man. Take that.

725
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,279
This is a surprise.

726
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,428
Big surprise.

727
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,599
Diet Pepsi.

728
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,429
You were really terrific.

729
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,636
- I mean, really...
- Thanks.

730
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,480
...very, how do I say...

731
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,395
Sexy?

732
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,072
- Exactly.
- That is the desired effect.

733
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:01,359
- Miss, that was just wonderful!
- Really, really wonderful!

734
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,238
- Thank you very much.
- Really, really wonderful.

735
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,753
Thanks a lot.

736
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,475
Fans.

737
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,272
What's the matter?

738
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,429
Nothin'. No, I was just...

739
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,636
This situation, I think, maybe is...

740
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,109
Situation?

741
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,751
I didn't expect this kind of thing.
That's all.

742
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,955
I mean, you told me you was
in a musical of some sort.

743
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,795
I thought you was doin' a Broadway show.

744
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,838
You told me the Governor's daughter,
whatever you were playing.

745
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,672
And I come here and see this.

746
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,795
Not that there's anything wrong with this.

747
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,150
Wait a second. I work hard here.

748
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,959
I dance. I get well-paid for it.
I don't fuck anybody.

749
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,828
I didn't say that. Now, please.

750
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,275
You're sitting there judging me.

751
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,272
I'm not judgin' you. Please don't say that.

752
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,997
I don't judge you.
What do you do that's so wonderful?

753
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,510
You ever kill anybody, Charlie?

754
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,235
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

755
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,351
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
just busted in like this.

756
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:35,277
My fault. I apologize.

757
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,355
I better go now.

758
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,556
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go home.

759
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,551
When am I gonna see you again?

760
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,314
Why don't you surprise me another time?

761
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,236
- Like when?
- I can't tell you that.

762
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,439
- Why not?
- 'Cause it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?

763
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,595
You know I want to feel your ass.

764
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,593
You already know my ass.

765
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,989
Come with me.

766
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,994
What the fuck are you lookin' at me for?

767
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,638
- Benny!
- How ya doin'?

768
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,357
- Benny Blanco from the Bronx!
- Hey, fat man.

769
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,038
The fattest man.

770
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,836
- Where's my money?
- What money?

771
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,832
My money, man! You play pussy,
you gonna get fucked!

772
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,353
Are you kidding?

773
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,639
- Where's Steffie?
- Steffie?

774
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,950
Get me Steffie, man. I'm Ionely.

775
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,436
- Si. Digame.
- Donde esta Steffie?

776
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,234
- Yo la vi por ahi.
- Vete a buscarla ya.

777
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,674
Muy bien.

778
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,319
Madre de Dios!

779
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,079
After that, she got six fucking kids.

780
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,030
There is a problem with Mr. Kleinfeld.

781
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,035
- What kind of problem?
- He's in the bathroom fucking Steffie.

782
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,072
So, what's the problem? Good for him.

783
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,714
But she belongs to Benny Blanco now.

784
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:43,791
Who?

785
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,310
You remember Benny Blanco
from the Bronx?

786
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,075
- That little piece of shit from the other day.
- Not that guy. Fuck him.

787
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,397
He's here, and he's gonna make trouble.

788
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,277
- Where is he?
- Over there.

789
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:02,559
Fuck him! Don't worry
about Benny Blanco. Go ahead, it's okay.

790
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,075
What do I do when they tell me that?

791
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,430
You gotta learn to live with it.

792
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:15,751
Where've you been hiding this man?
This is one sexy man.

793
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,799
- He's an animal. You know that?
- Faster than a speeding bullet.

794
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:27,269
Yeah, but he got himself
a Mercedes and a yacht, all of that.

795
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,637
Mr. Benny Blanco says it's gonna be okay.

796
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,794
He wants to send
a bottle of champagne over...

797
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,917
...and he wants you to send Steffie over,
when you're ready.

798
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:44,113
- Carlito, what should I do?
- No problem. Steffie's with Dave now.

799
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,279
But Benny said...

800
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,189
Fuck Benny!

801
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,677
This is from Benny Blanco.

802
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,829
Send it back!

803
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,915
Vete! Vete!

804
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,796
Please, you can't do this.

805
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,999
- Benny spends a lot of money here.
- He's a nickel-bagger. Come on.

806
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,835
What happened to you?
What are you acting like this for?

807
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,238
It doesn't make sense you should hate
this guy. This guy is you 20 years ago.

808
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,714
Never me.

809
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,952
This is the second time
you turned me down for a drink.

810
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,998
- You don't like my champagne?
- It could be.

811
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,670
Maybe there's a mis-fucking-understanding.

812
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,957
- Maybe you don't remember me.
- Maybe I don't give a shit.

813
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,751
Maybe I don't remember the last time
I blew my nose either.

814
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,479
Who the fuck are you,
I should remember you?

815
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,190
What, you think you're like me?

816
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,432
You ain't like me, motherfucker.
You're a punk.

817
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:49,638
I've been with made people,
connected people.

818
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,638
Who you been with?

819
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:56,553
Chain-snatchin', jive-ass,
maricon motherfuckers.

820
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,469
Why don't you get lost? Go ahead,
snatch a purse. Take a fuckin' walk.

821
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,996
The only problem here is that
Steffie doesn't know where she belongs.

822
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:09,232
- Steffie belongs here.
- I think Steffie's makin' a big mistake!

823
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,630
I'll blow your fucking head off.

824
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:21,036
- I'll blow this cocksucker's head off.
- Put that fuckin' gun away!

825
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,395
- How does it feel?
- Go! Go!

826
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,072
How does it feel?

827
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,228
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

828
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,317
What the fuck is this?

829
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,599
Watch the floor!

830
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,637
We've got a mis-fuckin'-communication
here, man!

831
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,913
Hold it! Stop him here.

832
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,472
Okay, Benny Blanco from the Bronx.

833
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,474
The chick Steffie belongs to the club.

834
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,998
If I ever see you here again...

835
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,077
...you die, just like that.

836
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,589
You're over, man.
You're fuckin' in the history books.

837
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,832
So you might as well kill me now, 'cause if
I ever see you again, I'm gonna kill you.

838
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,669
Get him out. Take him out the back.

839
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,839
Take him in the alley.

840
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,359
Dumb move, man. Dumb move.

841
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,474
But it's like them old reflexes comin' back.

842
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,349
I know what's supposed to happen now.

843
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,953
Benny's gotta go down.

844
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,594
And if I don't do it, they're gonna say:

845
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,588
"Carlito, he's flaky, man. Slacked-out.

846
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,873
"A used-to-be bad guy.
Joint got to Carlito. "

847
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:03,550
The street is watchin'.
She is watchin' all the time.

848
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,472
Hold it, hold it!

849
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,477
Let's put him in the trunk of the car
and drive him off the pier.

850
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:16,030
- Fuck you, man.
- It ain't that far. Down the block.

851
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,515
It'd be like the old days. Be fun.
