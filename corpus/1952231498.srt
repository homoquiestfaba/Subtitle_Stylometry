I have to see where.

831
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:21,147
Under... Understand me.

832
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:24,311
There has to be some way
to say good-bye.

833
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:28,624
Maybe they're not dead.

834
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,784
How do we know?

835
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,658
Huh? There is still a chance. No?

836
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:35,822
Maybe not everybody died.

837
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:39,667
You stay here and wait for me.

838
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:51,245
<i>Listen, if it were up to me,
I'd give you a couple days to grieve.</i>

839
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:53,248
But you're just
the middleman, right?

840
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:58,653
Your company has a regular,
legitimate trade with China, Taiwan,

841
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,655
Indonesia and the Philippines.

842
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:03,692
Now, from time to time,
your father would give us
a container number,

843
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:05,852
what port it's coming from,
name of the ship.

844
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:07,862
I mean, take a look.

845
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,694
<i>Two, three million of these
come through here every year.</i>

846
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:13,394
Now what's the odds against
any one of them being searched?

847
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:16,802
Whatever they are,
I don't have the option
of closing down the company.

848
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:21,138
Is that what you're telling me?
We'd like to keep the relationship
going with you. Yes.

849
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,144
Relationship?

850
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:26,477
First you stick me up
for a quarter mil.
Then you burn my car.

851
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:32,112
Now you won't even let me
bury my dad without trying to
nail my ass to something else?

852
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,554
<i>You need to work on
your relationships, pal.</i>

853
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,319
And you need to remember
that this is the real world,

854
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:41,159
and in the real world
you're just a loser who can't pay
the bills now that daddy's gone.

855
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,630
You do as you're told.

856
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:47,157
And one funeral in the family
is enough, isn't it?

857
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,938
We have a container
coming in today.

858
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,739
We need somewhere to unload it...
somewhere quiet,
used to handling overseas freight,

859
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,745
near the freeway.

860
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:01,749
You tell security
you're expecting a delivery,
make sure nobody's workin' late.

861
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:05,253
- That's all you have to do.
- And maybe go to prison for 10 years.

862
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:24,666
<i>[Man]
There's a guy coming up to see you.</i>

863
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,504
Uh, uh, Adam.
I don't know his last name.

864
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:29,840
Uh, Chechen.

865
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:32,176
<i>Let me put it this way.</i>

866
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:37,049
<i>I don't need him coming back here
asking, uh, too many questions
anytime soon, okay?</i>

867
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:47,519
<i>[Ship Horn Blows]
[Seagull Squawking]</i>

868
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:55,070
<i>Do you know
the name of the boat?
He said, ''Star Pacific. ''</i>

869
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:01,968
There.

870
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:04,308
<i>[Men Chattering]</i>

871
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:16,415
Why don't you wait here?
Uh, let me speak to them.

872
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,483
<i>No. I'm going too.</i>

873
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:25,160
<i>No, we don't want to cause anybody trouble.
We don't want blame anyone.</i>

874
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,225
This is my sister-in-law.

875
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,771
She... She lost her sister.

876
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,830
I lose my... my wife, my daughter.

877
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:33,875
Little... Little girl.

878
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:38,346
Yeah, well, we're just the guys
that meet the ships, you know?

879
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:41,850
We never know
what's coming in half the time.
We get the phone call, we go out.

880
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:45,684
<i>Some nights it's packages.</i>

881
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,552
<i>- Other nights it's illegals.
- [Adam]
People.</i>

882
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,595
<i>- Huh?
- Let's go.</i>

883
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:56,460
<i>People. It is people.
Human beings.</i>

884
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:59,968
- Yeah. All right.
People. Whatever.
- My wife and daughter is...

885
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:02,367
<i>[Wayne]
Take 'em someplace quiet.</i>

886
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,938
<i>There's transport waitin'for 'em.</i>

887
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:08,772
<i>After that, it's none of our business.</i>

888
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,192
How can ship go down
just like that?

889
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:29,561
<i>That's a dangerous piece
of water out there, boy.
It can take a ship any size.</i>

890
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:32,226
- With no warning? Nothing?
- Sorry to hear about your family.

891
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:35,566
<i>It could have hit a reef, sprung a plate.
Anything could have happened.</i>

892
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:39,665
Yeah, everybody did what they could.
Okay? You gotta believe that.
I mean, this is how we make a living.

893
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:41,471
No.
You think we wanna
lose a ship that size?

894
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:44,479
<i>- Come on.
- [Wayne]
That's our payday, buddy.</i>

895
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:47,175
Adam, we go.
Adam, we go.

896
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,443
Go. Go.

897
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:56,418
Jesus.
What did I tell you, huh?

898
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:59,256
<i>- [Wayne]
Shut up.!
- Come on, Adam.</i>

899
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,922
We go to the morgue
to identify bodies.
