169
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,375
Pedro Carmichael, an American...

170
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,645
...an artist, a friend.

171
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:15,219
<i>On a sultry day in July, Dr. Albert Quince...</i>

172
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,763
<i>...eminent New Orleans socialite</i>
<i>and brain surgeon...</i>

173

<i>glittering wedding party.</i>

174
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:28,499
<i>As he approaches his brother Robert's</i>
<i>imposing Garden District mansion...</i>

175
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:33,578
<i>...he little realizes</i>
<i>what dark and terrible revelations...</i>

176
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,780
<i>...lie in store for him.</i>

177
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,710
-Thank you, Lewis.
-Yes, Mr. Quince.

178
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,415
Albert! Wonderful to see you!

179
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:45,854
Robert.

180
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,420
My, my. Some style, little brother.

181
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:53,760
Hi! Maybe l should have thought about
the extermination business myself. Hi!

182
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,960
ls this the wealthiest brain surgeon
in New Orleans speaking?

183
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,731
-Come on. Say hello to Margaret.
-Margaret!

184
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,741
-Who's my favorite brother-in-law?
-Yes. Wonderful day.

185
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:08,542
Yes. And l want you to say hello
to the world's best son-in-law!

186
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,506
Dr. Quince.

187
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:15,019
Elmore, you call me ''Uncle Albert.''
You're a very, very lucky boy.

188
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,382
Yeah. Thank you, sir.

189
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:21,892
-Speaking of which, where is your lovely bride?
-Elena was asking for you a while back, sir.

190
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,586
Very anxious to see you.

191
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,325
-That my favorite nephew? Excuse me.
-Sure enough.

192
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,989
Richard?

193
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,399
Good morning, son. How are you?

194
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,132
Where's your sister?
Elmore says she's looking for me.

195
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,108
How are you, Uncle Albert? She's upstairs.

196
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,808
Richard?

197
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,283
ls everything all right? You feeling okay?

198
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:49,650
-You want pop down to see me at the clinic?
-Look, l'm fine. Thank you.

199
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,221
Excuse me.

200
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:55,692
<i>What fearful shadow is haunting</i>
<i>the young and brilliant Richard?</i>

201
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:59,062
<i>Albert Quince can only wait and wonder...</i>

202
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,789
<i>...what else this day has in store.</i>

203
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,040
<i>Elmore and Elena...</i>

204
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,511
...l now pronounce you man and wife.

205
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,114
You may kiss your bride.

206
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,340
Richard? What's wrong with Elena?
She seems a trifle upset.

207
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,604
Not to worry, Uncle Albert. She'll be all right.

208
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:51,915
What's wrong with you, boy? You look like
an Albanian peasant whose cow just died.

209
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,210
Uncle Albert<i>....</i>

210
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,681

212
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,860
Yes, of course you do. We all do.

213
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:10,663
-But today we should be happy for her, not sad.
-No, you don't want to understand.

214
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,205
l do love her.

215
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,464
l do. But...

216
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,941
...not as a sister.

217
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,817
Richard, what are you talking about, boy?

218
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:32,618
''lt's true. l don't care.
l don't care who knows it.

219
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,257
''You've got to believe me.''

220
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:39,593
''Don't say one word more!
You're not well, my boy. You're not well!''

221
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,630
''l do not love her as a sister!''

Sir?

228
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,028
Good morning, my friend.

229
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,938
Listen, l thought the serial...

230
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,837
...the soap, was extraordinary...

231
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,573
...original...

232
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,043
...so brave...

233
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,241
-...and uncompromising.
-Yes! Of course it was.

234
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,352
Four hours of production.

235
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,285
Time for a little refreshment, l believe.

236
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,584
Comin'?

237
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,996
So, anyway, l finally got up enough nerve.

238
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,806
Thank you, Charles.

239
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,402
What did you say this was?

240
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:32,273
lt's my own recipe. lt's a blend
of eucalyptus leaves and uncured tobacco.

241
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,780
lt tones up the mind...

242
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,980
...clears the synapses.

243
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,610
Try it.

244
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,085
God! Do you like it?

245
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,583
Hey...

246
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,393
...do bears do big pooty in the woods?

247
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,363
Anyway, you were saying?

248
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,091
l had a story published in the <i>Picayune.</i>

249
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:00,103
l'm not sure, l mean,
l'm studying to be a lawyer, but...

250
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,969
...l think l'd kind of like to be a writer.

251
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:07,138
You'd kind of like to be a writer?

252
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,301
Yeah.

253
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,617
He'd kind of like to be a writer.

254
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,415
lt's not the kind of job...

255
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,679
...you kind of like to have.

256
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,616
You're forced...

257
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,761
...compelled.

258
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,023
You got no choice, man.

259
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,993
-Yeah, well, l do feel like that.
-Us writers, Martin...

260
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,867
...can't afford to sit around.

261
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,773
We got to make reality impact.

262
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,943
Sei<i>z</i>e the opportunity.

263
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,277
Know what l mean?

264
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,092
l'm going to have the prime rib.

265
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,858
-Excellent, excellent choice.
-That's wonderful, darling.

266
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,433
Donald, that's got to be expensive.

267
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,131
You missed a great movie.

268
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,897
Yeah? What movie?

269
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,570
The one we were meant to go to together?

270
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,038
You didn't think l was<i>....</i> Yeah, you did.

271
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:19,541
You know, l was on a date. Another date.

272
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,284
With Brent?

273
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,181
Worse.

274
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,253
So, Brent, what do you think
you're going to have?

275
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,889
l think a little steamed flounder will be ample.

276
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,231
Good choice.

277
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,902
Hey, Olga, do they do lobster here?

278
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,517
Would you excuse me?
l'd like to tend to the call of nature.

279
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,026
Yeah. Sure.

280
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,237
-Come on, honey. Once around the dance floor.
-Luke.

281
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,108
Come on, you're not so old.

282
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:29,246
-Come on, Donald, Frances<i>. Allons dancer.</i>
-Come on, it's a slow one.

283
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:33,222
-You can handle that.
-Come on, Marty, dance with me, will you?

284
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:37,755
Quick, while the flounder's away
visiting the little boys'.

285
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,507
Aunt Julia?

286
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,275
-Drop the aunt stuff and raise your hands.
-Sure.

287
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,983
-Julia?
-Yeah?

288
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:03,748
l don't think, if you don't mind me saying this...

289
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:08,292
...l don't think you should be doing
this kind of thing, with all these old guys.

290
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,362
You're still quite young and okay-looking.

291
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,760
Thanks.

292
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,231
This Brent guy is just so dull!

293
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,873
Marty, l tell you something,
sometimes you'd be happy to settle for dull.

294
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:27,005
Nothing fancy, you know. No fancy ideas.
No more mistakes.

295
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,743
l'd like a dull man for a change.

296
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,649
Sort of boring.
With a heart condition. And rich.

297
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,449
Doesn't even have to be that good looking.

298
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,389
So, what happened to romance?

299
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,759
l got nothing against romance.

300
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,930
l'd just like, you know,
the deluxe version this time?

301
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,260
You know another good thing about dull men?

302
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,238
They won't proposition you every five seconds.

303
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,504
They won't always be trying to,
you know, do things with you.

304
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,405
What?

305
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,573
Sure.

306
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,317
You're not listening to me. Why?

307
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,117
Because...

308
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,958
...you look so beautiful tonight.

309
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,656
l mean it. Really great, you know?

310
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,458
Little Marty Loader. My God!

311
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:27,369
Will you give this ''Little Marty'' stuff a rest?
The name's Martin, okay?

312
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:32,336
Thank you, Martin, for the compliment.
lt is sweet.

313
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,881
l wonder what your father
would have said if he'd heard you.

314
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,450
l don't care.

315
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,449
l don't care what he thinks.

316
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,627
But dear Elena,
if the family should ever hear of this scandal<i>....</i>

317
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,497
l know, that's why l had to talk to you,
Uncle Albert.

318
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,504
There's only one course of action.
Put these notions out of your mind forever.

319
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,973
Elmore is a fine boy, a perfect choice.
Any other decision...

320
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:08,204
<i>...l can't bear to contemplate.</i>
<i>The blood would be in the cream...</i>

321
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,407
<i>...as those tight-fisted Albanian milkmaids</i>
<i>would put it.</i>

322
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,383
-But Uncle Albert, there's more, there's more!
-What?

323
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,886
l'm gonna have a baby!

324
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,586
<i>My dear. Stop worrying.</i>
<i>l can see you've been tormenting yourself.</i>

325
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:25,459
Tell Elmore an adjustment of documentation
is all that's necessary--

326
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,761
No, you don't understand.
lt's not Elmore's. lt's my brother's!

327
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,958
<i>lt's Richard's.</i>

328
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,761
l'm going to have my brother Richard's baby!

329
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,583
''l'm going to have my brother Richard's baby.''

330
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,243
Can we take a picture?

331
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:50,548
Yes, l'll<i>....</i>

332
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,886

-Hi, Martin.
-Hi, Nellie.

336
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,563
Where've you been all my life?

00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,667
So<i>....</i>

339
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,938
-See you later, right?
-Right.

340
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,044
-Hi.
-Marty.

341
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,189
-Where's Aunt Olga?
-Out.

342
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,351
Right.

343
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,860
So, who says romance is dead?

344
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,330
Thank you.

345
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,770
That's really sweet of--

346
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,211
No.

347
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:52,148
That is not romance. That is commerce.

348
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,387
A bunch of flowers buys a kiss? No, mister.

349
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,282
-What got into you?
-What about the other night?

350
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:04,150
The other night, an aunt dances
with her nephew. Call the vice squad.

351
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,059
Firstly, you're not my aunt.

352
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,394
You're my father's brother's wife's sister.

353
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,903
-You've been studying.
-And secondly, l am not a total innocent.

354
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,970
l can read the signals.

355
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,233
l'm 21, and l lost my cherry five years ago.

356
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:23,440
Well, l'm 36, and l lost mine
almost before you were born.

357
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,379
Think about it. l mean it.

358
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:29,214
So what? You don't look 36.
You don't even look like an aunt.

359
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:31,882
Look<i>....</i>

360
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:36,319
l've done some really cra<i>z</i>y things in my life...

361
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,865
...but this is definitely
not going to be one of them.

362
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,666
-You want a beer?
-Sure.

363
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,097
That's what you men drink these days.

364
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,343
You could almost be my son, you know that?

365
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,039
So l've almost got an Oedipus complex.

366
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,117
Well?

367
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,384
What?

368
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,958
Do you want to go out with me?

369
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,091
-My God.
-No, listen, we could go to the movies.

370
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,998
Really? What do you kids do after?

371
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,939
-You go for an ice cream soda, l suppose?
-Sure.

372
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,509
-They got chocolate sauce?
-Lots.

373
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,716
You gonna give me the flowers or what?

374
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:28,398
-So what are you doing tomorrow night?
-l don't know.

375
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,239
What am l doing tomorrow night?

376
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,349
-l'm not sure a whole day's a good idea.
-Sure it is.

377
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,011
-l'm not sure you'll like me after a day.
-Sure l will.

378
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,521
-Wait. You got an eyelash.
-That's worth waiting for.

379
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,022
Make a wish.

380
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,352
-You got your wish.
-When?

381
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,634
-Can anybody see me?
-Nope. Nobody can see you.

382
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,167
Nobody could see you
even if they were lookin' to see you.

383
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,980
l got one! l got one, Julia!

384
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:21,187
Well, go on! Pull it in!

385
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,317
You got to play a fish.

386
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:28,065
-lt's got to be tired, that's the whole point.
-Tired?

387
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,404
What're you doing?

388
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:49,510
For God's sake, Julia, that's my best racket!

389
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,722
ls this tired enough for you?

390
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,579
<i>A Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

391
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:27,155
Are they not the saddest words
you have ever, ever heard?

392
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,695
-She talked like that.
-Who?

393
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,155
Miss Blanche DuBois,
in <i>A Streetcar Named Desire...</i>

394
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,528
...by Mr. Tennessee Williams.

395
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:40,798
-See, you don't know everything, college boy.
-You could teach me what l don't know.

396
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,600
She was too old for him, anyway.

397
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:46,575
-You're still talking about Blanche?
-Yeah. She made a fool of herself...

398
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,546
...and then in the end,
they took her off to the loony bin, so there.

399
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,508
l'm going to write a book about you.

400
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,348
Yeah, about me?

401
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,881
Good!

402
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,860
l'll be good for something. Good.

403
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:09,563
<i>My Aunt Julia.</i> l'll call it <i>My Aunt Julia.</i>

404
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,158
l think you better change the name.

405
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,904
Maybe l will.

406
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,096
Maybe l won't.

407
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,071
Depends.

408
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,514
Depends...

409
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,850
...on what?

410
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,616
The fish is done.

411
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,792
<i>Okay, you've gone belly-up in shit's creek.</i>

412
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,992
<i>You need a paddle, real bad.</i>

413
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,532
What do you reach for?

414
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,464
Art!

415
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,437
That's what l'm talking about.

416
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:57,706
The very apex of your art!

417
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:03,877
l want to hear your sinews crack and strain.

418
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,453
l want your souls...

419
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,694
...to enter those microphones...

420
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,724
...and emerge like ghosts...

421
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,735
...in the homes of our listeners.

422
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:25,809
There's an army of them out there,
groping blindly...

423
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,705
...toiling in the darkness, waiting.

424
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:31,976
For what?

425
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:33,677
For you!

426
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,586
For your incandescent, brilliant...

427
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,557
...palpitating talent...

428
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,850
...to light up their miserable...

429
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,560
...impoverished, dull...

430
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,298
...and worthless lives!

431
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,208
Okay, gang, take five.

432
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,878
And then we'll hit it.

433
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:08,050
-Leonard, may l speak to you for a moment?
-Sure, Pedro.

434
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,217
What's up?

435
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:15,250
The key to your part, Leonard,
is you're in love, got it?

436
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,294
Madly in love.

437
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:20,425
You're in love so bad,
you can taste it in your mouth.

438
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,696
Yeah, that's what l'm feeling.

439
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,969
But l ain't hearing it, Len.

440
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,130
lt ain't coming across the airwaves,
know what l mean?

441
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,835
What l'm hearing is tired blood.
Ain't doing squat for me.

442
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,306
Jee<i>z,</i> Pedro, l<i>....</i>

443
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:42,118
-l'm doing my best.
-Okay, l got a trick for you, always works.

444
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,421
l want you to go to the can right now, okay?

445
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:50,586
Lock the door and jerk off.
Then come on out and do your lines.

446
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,931
-What?
-You know. Jerk off. Beat your meat.

447
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,730
Choke the chicken. Polish the rocket.
Manipulate the mango.

448
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:03,505
You've done it before, haven't you?

449
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,577
Yeah. Sure, lots of times.

450
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:10,644
What're you waiting for?
You got seven and a half minutes. Give it hell.

451
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,178
Yes, sir.

452
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,018
-Where're you going, Leonard?
-To the john.

453
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,653
-l gotta jerk off.
-Most amusing, Leonard.

454
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,120
Very droll.

455
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,095
Places, everybody.

456
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:41,076
After the shock of seeing his sister Elena,
who was carrying his child...

457
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,646
...marry Elmore Dubuque...

458
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,908
...Richard Quince flees his family home...

459
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,951
...to take Holy Orders
and work in a leper colony.

460
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:52,580
His anguished father, Robert, has sent for
the colony's priest, Father Serafim.

461
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,892
''Where had l gotten to, Miss Jones?''

462
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,419
''Albanians, sir.''

463
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,125
''Yes.

464
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:07,830
''This firm has a strict policy
of not employing Albanians.''

465
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,372
This is largely because of their
bestial sexual habits...

466
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:19,440
...and their practice of attendin'
to their calls of nature in a bucket...

467
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,420
...located in the same room they use...

468
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,319
...for eatin' and sleepin'.

469
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,416
Sincerely...

470
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,126
...Robert...

471
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,556
...E...

472
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,028
...Quince.

473
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,100
-Yes?
<i>-Father Serafim from the leper colony is here.</i>

474
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,502
Thank you.

475
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,535
Show him in, Gladys.

476
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,585
Father Serafim? He'll see you now.

477
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,024
-Father.
-Mr. Quince.

478
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:05,855
Father Serafim,
l believe my son Richard is with you?

479
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,567
Yes, sir. He works with us down at the mission.
A good boy.

480
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,929
Please go on, Father.

481
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:16,966
Well...

482
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,009
...as long as l live...

483
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:24,471
...l shall never forget the day
he arrived at the mission.

484
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:30,420
<i>He was like some poor battered ship...</i>

485
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,820
<i>...seekin' shelter from the storm.</i>

486
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,522
Father, will you give me...

487
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,755
...shelter from the storm?

488
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,997
<i>Since that day, he seems like a man...</i>

489
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,533
<i>...possessed.</i>

490
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:53,337
<i>He never stops working</i>
<i>for the sick or the needy.</i>

491
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:59,013
<i>He seems haunted, driven...</i>

492
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,779
...as if he's trying to escape...

493
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,857
...from some terrible, dark secret.

494
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,690
Life is strange!

495
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,663
What is it, my son? Tell me.

496
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,298
You see, Father...

497
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,733
...l never knew my father, Father.

498
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,610
When l was a boy...

499
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,809
<i>...my baby sister...</i>

500
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,879
<i>...was sleeping in her cot.</i>

501
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,657
<i>l was meant to be watching her.</i>

502
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,459
There were rats everywhere.

503
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,537
They were as hungry as we were!

504
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,615
<i>Since that day, Father, l vowed never...</i>

505
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:13,813
<i>...to relinquish the fight</i>
<i>against those disgusting vermin.</i>

506
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,527
<i>And Albanians, of course.</i>

507
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,957
Have you heard?
Father wants me to meet with him...

508
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,795
...and Father Serafim says l should.

509
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,927
-You must talk to him eventually.
-He'll take me away from you.

510
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,268
lt's hopeless. You can't hide here forever.

511
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,967
You've a brilliant career as a lawyer
yet ahead of you.

512
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,601
l'd rather be an Albanian goat salesman
than leave you.

513
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,179
-Richard--
-l love you!

514
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,339
-No, don't say that.
-l love you.

515
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,440
-Richard, you mustn't say--
-l love you.

516
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:44,351
-You mustn't say that.
-l do love you, l'll marry you.

517
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:48,391
That's hopeless. You're my brother!

518
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,016
What are we to do?

519
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:54,160
-What are we to do, Elena?
-l don't know, Richard!

520
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,493
Elena<i>....</i>

521
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:01,169
Let's leave here.
Let's live together as man and wife!

522
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,686
Not too bad, everybody.

523
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,382
We're coming along.

524
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:22,422
We're getting better. Slowly, but surely.

525
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,790
That was wonderful, wasn't it?

526
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,957
-All in a day's work.
-His rain was beautiful, wasn't it?

527
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:38,866
How was l, Pedro?

528
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:44,110
Good. You were good, Len.
That little trick worked?

529
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,447
l did it three times. Just to be on the safe side.

530
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,580
That's what l call a dedicated artist, Leonard.

531
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,119
A dedicated artist.

532
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:18,212
<i>l don't agree, l don't think it trivializes Paris.</i>

533
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:21,546
Because it was a romance.
l mean, romance can take place anywhere.

534
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,621
lt could be <i>An American in Detroit.</i>
lt doesn't matter where.

535
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,816
-l agree.
-Yeah, good. l like that.

536
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:32,158
lt's just that it's not a Paris
that l'm very interested in seeing.

537
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,855
l thought it was a lie.

538
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:37,559
l'm interested
in the Paris of Hemingway and Henry Miller.

539
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,032
l know what you're getting at.

540
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:42,264
You think all the great American writers
go to Paris, right?

541
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,364
-Well, yeah.
-Yeah.

542
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,636
Because all American writers go to Paris.

543
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,042
-Yeah?
-l'm telling you, Julia.

544
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,748
You stay in a little hotel on the Left Bank.

545
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,410
You go out in the morning
and have breakfast at La Palette.

546
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:59,580
You sit outside with a big cup of <i>café créme...</i>

547
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,950
...and a warm <i>pain au chocolat.</i>

548
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:05,827
You walk down Rue Bonaparte
and come out on the river.

549
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:10,161
The sun is shining on the water,
and the plane trees are going cra<i>z</i>y.

550
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:15,637
You look up to your right,
and there's Notre Dame and the lle St. Louis.

551
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,639
A cool bree<i>z</i>e is blowing. You fill your lungs.

552
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:27,039
And you are inspired.

553
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,886
You feel fantastic.

554
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,586
You can do anything.

555
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,056
-When were you there?
-l wasn't.

556
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,693
But l read all the right books.

557
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:47,302
Anyway, pretty soon it's time for an aperitif.
We walk down the Rue--

558
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:52,100
-l'm there, too, am l?
-Of course! Of course you are.

559
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,306
We stroll up to the Deux Magots.

560
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,472
We order <i>sandwichs au camembert</i>
and two Pernods.

561
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:02,582
That first taste of aniseed. The bread.

562
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:04,785
The cheese.

563
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,853
You and l.

564
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,563
And then we sip and we plan which little bistro
we're going to eat in tonight.

565
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,266
Shall we go to the Brasserie Lipp...

566
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,166
...or maybe down to Montparnasse
and the Closerie des Lilas?

567
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,068
Can we get the check?

568
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,905
-What did l do?
-Nothing. l just...

569
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,337
...you know, came back to reality, that's all.
Look, l got to go.

570
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,209
Hey, what's going on?

571
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:35,708
lt's called being rational, you know?
lt's called common sense.

572
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:39,214
-Common sense?
-Yeah, common sense.

573
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:43,259
Julia, you are the least commonsensical person
l have ever met!

574
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,353
Thanks a bunch. l got news for you.
l got big stocks of common sense.

575
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,024
l got a warehouse of common sense.

576
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:54,571
Boy, you got me.
l can't believe you really got me like that.

577
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:59,239
l'm sorry, l don't want to be the one
to pop your balloon, but--

578
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:03,040
lf l'm interrupting, please tell me.
Hate to be a buttinsky.

579
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:06,014
God. Hi, Pedro. No.

580
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:09,850
This is Julia Busquet, my aunt.

581
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,183
-Pedro Carmichael.
-Very pleased to meet you. l love your stuff.

582
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,351
l usually never listen
to that kind of garbage at all.

583
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,719
Excuse me, l have to go now. l'll see you soon...

584
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:22,731
...and it's nice to meet you, Mr. Carlton.

585
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,300
Carmichael!

586
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,668
Well, well, well, Martin.

587
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,409
Your aunt.

588
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,273
My God, l got to say that l'm impressed.

589
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,306
Really? You like her?

590
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,485
Does Pinocchio have wooden balls?

591
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:48,619
Sure l do. This is good, Martin. l'm pleased.

592
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:51,758
You know...

593
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,455
...l feel reality impacting here.

594
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,439
Believe me.

595
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:10,743
Listen, you want to stop and get a drink?
l'll think of what we should do next.

596
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,173
Sure.

597
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,541
Are you Pedro Carmichael?

598
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:22,057
-Who wants to know? Who are you?
-We're the people who kill children.

599
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,784
Yeah, they're the people who have
the cream covered in blood.

600
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:29,065
Are you gentlemen, by any chance...

601
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:33,533
...of Albanian ancestry,
if you don't mind my asking?

602
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,303
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

603
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,298
We are.

604
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:42,436
You got your head up your asses, dick lickers.

605
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:47,746
You scum-sucking Albanian douchebags.

606
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,319
Get the fuck out of my way!

607
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,053
Police! Help!

608
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,193
Quick, run! The cops!

609
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,263
Run, you ass-licking geeks!

610
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,565
Don't think l ain't gonna get you.

611
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,137
White-bone, chicken-shit faggot!

612
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:13,566
You too, doughboy. l've seen your face!

613
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:17,175
You boys are foreigners. You're finished!

614
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:21,144
You fart sucker. Moron. Degenerate.

615
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,789
Unfair to Albanians!
l will not eat, l will not sleep...

616
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:31,258
...until they ban Pedro Carmichael.

617
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,893
What are we gonna do, Martin?

618
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,535
What are we gonna do?

619
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,301
About what, Sid? Sam.

620
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,170
Sid.

621
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:54,209
About this damned Albanian crap. Sit down.

622
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,913
l tell you, Sam is way<i>....</i>

623
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,623
Sam is out of his box.
And l tell you this, Martin.

624
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:04,091
He's got to stop this anti-Albanian stuff.
lt's getting out of hand.

625
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,492
Quite apart from that spectacle outside...

626
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,327
...l've got 80 letters of complaint here.

627
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,860
And now it turns out
that the Mayor's wife is half Albanian.

628
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:18,101
l never reali<i>z</i>ed there were so many
friggin' Albanians in this burg.

629
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:22,903
And yet, all praise to the Good Lord...

630
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,605
...our audience is up...

631
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,684
...183% .

632
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:32,318
What the Sam Hill am l gonna do, Martin?
You tell me.

633
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:38,161
l don't know.
Tell him to go easy on the Albanian gags?

634
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:42,461
Go easy?

635
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,594
Go easy.

636
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:49,833
l figured<i>....</i> l mean, are they that important?

637
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,603
-Are they really worth bothering about?
-Yes.

638
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,741
Yes, Martin. Yes, they are.

639
00:46:57,614 --> 00:47:00,412
Everybody's got to have something to hate.

640
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,616
Hate burns.

641
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,082
lt burns like love.

642
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,249
But why Albanians?

643
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,355
Why not?

644
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:19,193
The impact of reality.
Without that, the artist is nothin'.

645
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,334
-l promised l'd ask.
-That's what l like about you, Martin.

646
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,604
All that reality, impacting everywhere.

647
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,768
-lt is?
-You bet.

648
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:35,280
So, how are things going
with the beautiful Aunt Julia?

649
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,718
Not so good. She just won't take me seriously.

650
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,053
Hey, look, you got to<i>....</i> How l should l say it?

651
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:47,821
You got to get more sophisticated,
more chic, like the French do.

652
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:52,698
l'll tell you, l invite you and Julia
to my house for dinner.

653
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,498
That'd be my pleasure.

654
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,472
-All right.
-Leave everything to me.

655
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,305
-ls this the right address?
-l think so.

656
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,573
God, l'm glad l got my shots.

657
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:10,310
Hi. Nice to see you. Come on in.

658
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,881
Forgive the mess.

659
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:18,085
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.

660
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:23,765
Don't mind me. Just doing a little dusting.

661
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,305
Lord.

662
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:46,183
-Do you see that? Did you see it?
-Sure.

663
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,452
What's it saying to you?

664
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,991
Good help's hard to find?

665
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,959
That the room is dusty?

666
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:02,467
And you claim you want to be a writer.
No, Martin. Shallow.

667
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,105
That says 20 years of dusting...

668
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,102
...eight kids...

669
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:11,241
...and a husband that's a drunk and a bum!

670
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:13,816
Yeah. Yeah, l got you now.

671
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,886
You see, Martin, with these little gi<i>z</i>mos...

672
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,016
...l can sort of...

673
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,422
...become the characters l invent.
They become real.

674
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:28,128
Trick of the trade.
Anyway, listen, l'm sorry, but l forgot...

675
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,894
...l got to do something, l got to go out.
So it'll just be the two of you.

676
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:34,368
But it's all set up in the kitchen. Come along.

677
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,237
And l'll try and make it back for dessert.
Navarin of lamb, vichyssoise...

678
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:41,903
...new potatoes,
and a <i>sorbet au praline</i> in the icebox.

679
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,546
l think you'll find
the 1928 Chateau Latour precocious...

680
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,350
...but very drinkable.

681
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:56,822
Got to run.

682
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,431
<i>-Bonsoir, m'sieu et 'dame.</i>
<i>-Bonsoir, madame.</i>

683
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:13,903
<i>Mademoiselle?</i>

684
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:22,885
Here's to us.

685
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,655
-Julia?
-Boy, this is the real stuff.

686
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:34,857
-l've got to say something to you--
-Hold it. Hold it, don't move.

687
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:52,776
l think he followed me from New York.
What were you saying?

688
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,082
-Julia.
-Yeah?

689
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:01,680
These last weeks<i>....</i>
Well, l want you to know that...

690
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,022
-...l think l'm beginning to fall in love--
-Hold it.

691
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,788
-What?
-A bad attack of mood is what.

692
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:14,703
Just send home the violinist, will you?
Just turn up the lights.

693
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:18,768
God, you're obnoxious!
l don't know why l even bother!

694
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,001
Jesus!

695
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,504
-Why do you guys do this?
-Do what?

696
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:26,138
Why do you think
you have to be filthy to be sincere?

697
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,375
l'm sincere, not filthy.

698
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:30,419
You're sincere and you're poor,
it's the same difference.

699
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,921
Listen, if you're happy,
it doesn't matter how poor you are!

700
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,322
You fell for that one, too?

701
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:40,622
God, what am l doing?
Send for the men in the white coats!

702
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:45,692
l'll tell you, l don't know much.
l don't know if l'll ever be happy...

703
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:48,498
...but l sure as hell know
l'm never gonna be poor again.

704
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,334
Sounds great.

705
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:53,105
Real hard-boiled. Real mature.

706
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,642
So why don't l believe a word
that you're saying here?

707
00:51:56,746 --> 00:52:00,648
-Listen, l know you, and this is not you!
-You know me, you college boy?

708
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,843
-You don't know anything about me.
-Listen!

709
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,615
You are not afraid of being poor!

710
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:13,319
-You just got afraid of being hurt, that's all.
-Smarten up. You got to get things straight.

711
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:19,167
You were a friend, you know?
For a while, l thought l had a real friend...

712
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,533
...and that was something l'd missed out on.

713
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:25,039
lt made me feel good for a while,
it made me feel 18 for a while...

714
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,804
...but that's<i>....</i> lt was just dumb.

715
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,173
l shouldn't have, you know?

716
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:34,215
You're a really sweet guy
and l don't want to hurt you.

717
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,809
-Please, believe me. l don't want to hurt you.
-Then don't.

718
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:41,186
You've got to face reality. lt's over, finished.

719
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:45,558
l mean it. Face it.
lt was never real to begin with.

720
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:50,195
<i>l don't want to hurt you, Elmore,</i>
<i>and l've never felt this way before, either...</i>

721
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,564
...but it's useless! lt's got no future.

722
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:57,072
Elmore, we've got to face it. lt can't go on.
l can't go on. lt's over.

723
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:01,076
We are finished!
For heaven's sakes, l am your mother-in-law!

724
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:05,080
But don't you see, Margaret?
That doesn't bother me. l don't care!

725
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,412
Darlin', we're not living in Albania.

726
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:12,586
<i>But Margaret, think about it from</i>
<i>an Albanian point of view. Our love.</i>

727
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:17,655
<i>That of a virile, handsome young man</i>
<i>for the maturely attractive mother...</i>

728
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:21,060
<i>...of his pregnant wife. lt's positively innocent</i>/

729
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,694
Hi, Martin. Come on in. Quickly.

730
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:30,569
l've just got to catch the end of the serial.
Make yourself at home. Can l get you anything?

731
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,033
l haven't seen Julia for a while...

732
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,668
...and l was wondering
if she wanted to go to a movie.

733
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:39,579
She's not here. Haven't you heard?
There's a new man on the scene.

734
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:41,150
No. l hadn't heard.

735
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,809
<i>...because you're my son-in-law...</i>

736
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:43,886
Who is he?

737
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:46,353
<i>...because you're married to my daughter...</i>

738
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:48,686
A Doctor Ted Orson.

739
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,523
He's a ladies' doctor.

740
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,027
A gynecologist.

741
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,564
Handsome. Very rich.
Lovely house in the Garden District.

742
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,760
Hey, isn't that great news?

743
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:05,305
<i>-...we mustn't go any further.</i>
<i>-You can't be serious</i>/

744
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:07,373
<i>We've got to face it, Elmore, it's over.</i>

745
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,240
l better get going.

746
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:12,873
l guess Aunt Julia's
too busy for the movies these days.

747
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:15,375
Bye.

748
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,312
-What?
<i>-All this is perfectly normal.</i>

749
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:22,687
-Sure l can't get you<i>....</i> Bye.
<i>-No</i>/ <i>lt's foreign, it's unnatural...</i>

750
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:26,626
<i>...it's incestuous</i>/ <i>lt's totally Albanian</i>/

751
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,805
Bug off, pus-face, or you die.

752
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,148
Mom!

753
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:53,911
Hello?

754
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,491
<i>-Martin?</i>
-Yeah.

755
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:59,022
<i>-Boy, are you sore?</i>
-Sore? Why should l be sore?

756
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:03,725
-You're free, you can do what you like.
-He is sore. Can l meet so l can explain?

757
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:08,064
What's there to explain
about a wealthy gynecologist?

758
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:10,639
Look, Ted Orson is a decent, kind...

759
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,401
<i>...successful--</i>

760
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:14,977
Hello, Martin?

761
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,811
-What's the matter, honey?
-Nothing.

762
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:31,391
Just my nephew.
He thinks he's madly in love with me, that's all.

763
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,030
God, l do love your sense of humor.

764
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:41,728
l probably shouldn't have told you. l'm sorry.

765
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:44,463
No, it's all right. Pardon me.

766
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,970
Nellie! Hi!

767
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,938
-l was just wondering if maybe tonight--
-Martin.

768
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,571
lf l never see you again, it'll be soon enough.

769
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:57,244
-Hey! What did l do?
-Go look in your office, you pervert!

770
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,850
Pedro. What was that about?

771
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:05,861
Women! God! You can't figure them.

772
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:10,455
Yes, why, thank you for callin'.
l'm so glad you're enjoying the show.

773
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:16,431
Okay. Get this.

774
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,969
Don't you ever hang up on me again. l hate that!

775
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,939
Sorry. Forgive me?

776
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:30,414
l'm so sorry that you hate it
when someone hangs up on you!

777
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:33,851
How truly horrible that must be for you!

778
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,756
But what about me?

779
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:44,594
You just hurt me
more than anyone has ever hurt me before.

780
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:48,694
l'm sorry if l hurt you, but you've got to back off.
You don't have a hold over me...

781
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:51,365
...and l don't remember asking
for all these judgments!

782
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:54,466
And thank you, by the way, for all this pressure.

783
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,546
That's just what l need!
Nothing like a lot of aggravation...

784
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:01,014
...for settin' you up for the day.
What? What are you looking at?

785
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:03,676
-You.
-So?

786
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:07,516
You look great when you're angry.

787
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,123
<i>And thank you...</i>

788
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,591
<i>...thank you so much for all this pressure.</i>

789
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,628
<i>You know, that's just what l need.</i>

<i>Nothing like a lot of aggravation</i>

<i>-What? What are you looking at?</i>
<i>-You.</i>

<i>-So?</i>
<i>-You look great when you're angry.</i>

793
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,301
<i>-l don't believe it.</i>
-Bastard!

794
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:41,888
Why, Pedro?

795
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:43,416
Why?

796
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,595
-Why what?
-Why did you do it?

797
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:50,824
-Why did l do what?
-Why did you put what we said on the radio?

798
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:54,764
-Martin, my boy, let me ask you one question.
-What?

799
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:59,341
-What's more important, life or art?
-But it wasn't art!

800
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:03,043
You just copied word for word what we said!

801
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:07,646
And where did you get the words you used?

802
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,610
Your attitudes...

803
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,647
...the so-called feelings in your stupid heart?

804
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:17,782
From me, from us. Writers.

805
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,430
You feed on us! We feed on you.

806
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:23,891
Art isn't just some guy's name, you know.

807
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,094
Art is two cannibals on a desert island...

808
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:32,036
...dying of hunger. Eat or be eaten, Martin.
Name of the game.

809
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:33,635
Eat...

810
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:35,433
...or be eaten.

811
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:42,082
You don't have to say anything, son.
You made a simple mistake.

812
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,882
Could happen to anybody.
l'm used to being misunderstood.

813
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:48,389
And to show you l have no hard feelings...

814
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:52,894
...l bought you
and the beautiful Aunt Julia a gift.

815
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:02,127
-Nero Nero Club. For tonight?
-Have a wonderful time, Martin.

816
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:06,231
Show her a good time. Eat, drink.

817

Mr. Loader?

Congratulations, sir.

Cut the rug.

01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:21,861
<i>-What, Margaret?</i>
<i>-The family have discovered our affair.</i>

840
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,522
<i>-They know everything</i>/
<i>-But how?</i>

841
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:28,195
<i>Well, you remember that evil, squintin',</i>
<i>unwashed Albanian stable boy...</i>

842
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,669
<i>...the one we call--</i>

843
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:37,468
So, are you still taking Julia to the movies?

844
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:41,041
Not so much these days. You know.

845
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:44,017
You should ask her again.
l think she'd like that.

846
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,178
Sure.

847
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:48,049
You gettin' on okay with her?

848
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:50,624
Yeah, l guess.

849
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,186
Yeah, l guess so.

850
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,061
That right?

851
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:59,001
l think you should call her up.
l think that'd be nice.

852
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:04,398
Hello?

853
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,973
<i>They know about us.</i>
<i>They told me this morning...</i>

854
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,840
<i>-...they're going to tell your parents tonight.</i>
-My God.

855
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:11,038
<i>l'm dead.</i>

856
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:13,741
l'm across the street.
l know they're watching me.

857
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:18,379
They called me a fallen woman.
Can you believe that?

858
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:22,446
l said to stick it up their ass.
They say we've got to stop seeing each other...

859
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,356
-...l've got to go back to New York.
<i>-What? You can't</i>/

860
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:28,658
<i>Look, l don't care, Julia.</i>
<i>l love you, for God's sakes</i>/

861
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,927
<i>-l don't care what they say</i>/
-Yeah, l told them that, too.

862
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,197
<i>-What? That l love you?</i>
-No. That l love you.

863
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:36,932
<i>You do?</i>

864
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:39,566
Yeah!

865
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,676
This is cra<i>z</i>y.

866
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,474
But l love you, too.

867
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,571
l am cra<i>z</i>y.

868
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:51,586
l guess it's just not in the cards.

869
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,218
<i>Martin? Are you all right? Are you crying?</i>

870
01:04:57,793 --> 01:05:00,421
You make me sick.
You make me sick to my stomach.

871
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:05,364
l should beat the living shit out of you, boy,
only your mother begged me not to.

872
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:09,705
-When l think of you and that whore bitch, Julia!
-l love her!

873
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:13,976
l could run her in, you stupid<i>....</i>

874
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,544
l could book her
for corrupting the morals of a minor!

875
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:20,514
-Dad, l'm not a minor.
-Three years in the slammer, no trouble!

876
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,679
For the sake of your mother and the family,
l'm gonna leave her alone.

877
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:28,245
But you ain't ever going near her again.
She's leaving.

878
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:31,252
Luke and Olga are gonna throw her out.

879
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:34,625
l warn you, Martin. You see her once more...

880
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:39,598
...and l've got her up in front of a judge
on a morals bust as quick as a bunny.

881
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,001
You got it?

882
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,236
Yes, sir.

883
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:46,297
My God.

884
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,876
What a quandary.

885
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:02,418
My God, what a can of worms!

886
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,887
What to do, what to do.

887
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:08,628
Boy, there's a lot of reality impacting here.

888
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,157
Listen, Martin.

889
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,932
Tell me how you really feel
about your Aunt Julia.

890
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,339
Your strong personal feelings. Honestly.

891
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,173
Well<i>....</i>

892
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:26,312
l feel<i>....</i>

893
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,684
-l love her.
-l see.

894
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:36,086
-And have you told her that?
-Yes. Lots of times.

895
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:40,953
-And what did she say?
-She said she loved me, too.

896
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:42,655
Okay.

897
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:48,532
-And you do love her, really, truly?
-Sure! Sure, l do.

898
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:51,372
Then there's only one thing to do.

899
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:54,375
Martin, you got to fish or cut bait.

900
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,207
-l do.
-You got to get married.

901
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,340
Married?

902
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:27,576
-Wait here a second. lt won't be long.
-Pedro!

903
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:31,770
-You sure you know what you're doing?
-Can you clean your teeth?

904
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,974
Everything's under control.

905
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,357
So here we are.

906
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:57,831
Point of no return time, l would say.

907
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,366
Julia, it's the only way. What else can we do?

908
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:05,409
l could get out of the car and walk away, for one.

909
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,982
This isn't what l planned.

910
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:13,920
You know, you were supposed to be
65 years old with a heart condition.

911
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:16,184
l'm working on the last item.

912
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:21,226
God, you are so great, you know.

913
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,660
You're so beautiful.

914
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:25,764
Yeah, but for how long?

915
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:28,602
When l'm 50, you're going to be 35.

916
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:34,276
What will you do when l get
my hot flashes and my mood swings?

917
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,509
l'm serious. What am l gonna do?

918
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:43,677
Face it, l'm not always going to be so gorgeous
and beautiful and funny and sophisticated...

919
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,311
...as l am today, she said modestly.

920
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:47,616
You are.

921
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,154
Or you will be to me.

922
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,891
One day<i>....</i>

923
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,725
One day, you're gonna get tired of me.

924
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:01,001
Julia, what can l say? l love you!

925
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,070
l love you...

926
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:06,197
...and l think l'll always love you.

927
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:08,773
l can't say any more than that.

928
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:10,375
No one can.

929
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,613
Kiss me.

930
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:30,765
Okay.

931
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,064
Okay, what?

932
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,266
l'll tell you what l'll do.

933
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,567
l'll make a deal with you.

934
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:46,040
Five years. That's all l want. Just five.

935
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:50,073
You know, but it's got to be a deal.
You got to promise, okay?

936
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:53,155
Love me only for five years,
and then when you leave me...

937
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:56,349
...it won't be too late
for me to find another Ted Orson.

938
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:59,120
-Julia, don't.
-Five years. Promise me.

939
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:02,658
l promise.

940
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:05,962
No. Think about it.

941
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:08,594
Think what you're promising me.

942
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:13,168
l promise.

943
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,740
Okay. l take your promise.

944
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,477
But l'm only holding you to five years.
For five years...

945
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:24,849
...l'll do this totally cra<i>z</i>y, totally screwy thing!

946
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,166
The ring.

947
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:22,041
-Excuse me?
-Martin, the ring?

948
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:24,073
Sure!

949
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,407
Sorry.

950
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:28,715
Repeat after me.

951
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,681
With this ring...

952
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:36,585
...l thee<i>....</i>

953
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,561
Goodness. Excuse me.

954
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:49,297
...wed.

955
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:01,274
Martin, come on.

956
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:05,148
-Hi, Leonard.
-Come on, Martin.

957
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:07,245
No hard feelings.

958
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:10,114
What's going on? Who is this guy?

959
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:12,887
Take it easy, old boy. Take it easy.

960
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,858
Go easy, son. Just a misunderstanding.

961
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:17,932
lmpact of reality?

962
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,728
Calm down, son.

963
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:21,803
Wait till this impacts on your face!

964
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24,538
l warned you.

965
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,201
-Hold him down, Leonard!
-lt was only a joke--

966
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:29,538
Shut up!

967
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:34,911
-l think we should talk about this.
-Let's talk about this? Come here!

968
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:38,114
Come on. Let's talk about it!

969
01:12:38,587 --> 01:12:41,283
You can't hit him, Martin. He's a writer!

970
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:43,987
What's going on here?

971
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:52,266
l don't understand.
What do you think you're doing?

972
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,836
-Julia--
-No, no! Don't come near me.

973
01:12:56,672 --> 01:13:00,267
l thought we had the best thing,
you know, best thing ever.

974
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,435
-Julia, please--
-Keep away.

975
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:08,212
lt was just that l thought it was so great,
you know. lt was great!

976
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:11,385
l'm so sorry.

977
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,921
Let go! lt's the only thing.
You got to let her go!

978
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:17,617
Get out of my way!

979
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:21,728
Julia! Wait!

980
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:31,668
Moose poop. How're we gonna get back now?

981
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:33,867
l've got my motorcycle. l could go for help.

982
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:37,742
-Where? Where is it?
-Don't hit! lt's right around there.

983
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:42,875
Wait. lt'll all turn out fine in the end.
lt always does.

984
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:45,180
Open the throttle.

985
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:50,182
-Trust me.
-Go to hell, Carmichael! Go to hell!

986
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,267
Elmore, stop, for God sakes.

987
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:06,770
You're driving like a
one-armed Albanian with crabs.

988
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:09,173
l'm beggin' you, stop!

989
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:14,139
Margaret! Don't you ever call me an--

990
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,310
lt was Pedro!

991
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:56,386
Please, stop!

992
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,258
lt wasn't me!

993
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:17,438
-lt was Pedro! l had nothing to do with that!
-Go away!

994
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:20,980
Julia! l had nothing to do with it. Stop!

995
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,300
<i>Julia, honey. Please, don't.</i>

996
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:50,804
Maybe if you apologi<i>z</i>ed to Luke...

997
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,376
...and in a week or so, if you got together
with Donald and Frances.

998
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:58,578
They're reasonable people
and if you promised not to see Martin--

999
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,518
Olga, stop. Stop, now.

1000
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:04,517
l'm not going to apologi<i>z</i>e to anyone.

1001
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:09,490
lt was all going so nicely.
And you've just ruined everything!

1002
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:14,230
We thought you'd changed.
We really did, we thought at last you were...

1003
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:16,167
...being practical about things.

1004
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:18,501
But you haven't changed, have you?

1005
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:22,469
You're still the same old Julia. Just wild.

1006
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:27,778
And stubborn. And impossible.

1007
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:33,650
You'll never grow up, will you?

1008
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,150
No. l guess not.

1009
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:54,106
Sorry, sis.

1010
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,521
Hi, Martin. What's new?

1011
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,153
Listen, bastard.

1012
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:46,557
You've got to find Julia now and tell her
l had nothing to do with that cra<i>z</i>y stunt!

1013
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,460
l did it already. l told her. She knows.

1014
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:53,426
You did? You found her?
You know where she is?

1015
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,631
What do you know? Speak of the devil.

1016
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:03,878
lt wasn't me!

1017
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:06,672
l had nothing to do with it, l swear.

1018
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:10,175
-Everything l said to you was true.
-l can handle this myself.

1019
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:13,413
-l love you, okay?
-Okay, fella. Easy.

1020
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,581
-That's wrong. You're an idiot!
-Come on now.

1021
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,660
-Listen, slimebag, back off!
-Okay.

1022
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:30,594
You just don't understand.

1023
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:43,382
What'd he do? He hit you in the nuts?
He gave you a cheap shot?

1024
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:47,785
He hit you low, l saw that.
Gynecologist, what do you expect?

1025
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,785
Take deep breaths.

1026
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:51,918
Bitch!

1027
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:54,693
That goddamn bitch of hell!

1028
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:57,863
l just knew she'd go back to that bastard.

1029
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:00,992
Can you believe that? Women.
God, make you sick.

1030
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:06,229
l gotta do something.
l'm not gonna let this happen.

1031
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:09,367
-l'm not gonna let this happen.
-You've got guts, kid.

1032
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,412
You gotta show 'em to the lady.

1033
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:14,676
You gotta find that doctor
and scare the shit out of him.

1034
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:17,445
And l'll tell you exactly how to do it.

1035
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:19,776
You got a gun?

1036
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:29,720
Back off, you slimebags!

1037
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:31,497
l got a gun.

1038
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:36,867
Run, you ass-kissing geeks! l've seen your face.

1039
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:40,440
You're finished! l tell you, man...

1040
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:43,140
...you bought the farm!

1041
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:47,545
You fart-sucking moral degenerate!

1042
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:51,585
Corn-holing, dingbat, finger man!

1043
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:53,551
Take it easy, sir. We'll get 'em.

1044
01:19:53,655 --> 01:19:56,783
There's a gang of Albanian deviants
terrori<i>z</i>ing the neighborhood.

1045
01:19:56,892 --> 01:20:00,953
Albanians! l should have known.
That particular smell!

1046
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,723
That hangdog, cretinous look.

1047
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:07,294
As you know, sir, they're breast-fed
up until the age of 10.

1048
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:09,997
That's disgusting!

1049
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:15,633
l would say that's a little generous, sir.
l'd say they were subhuman.

1050
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:23,314
Son of a bitch.

1051
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:29,185
Hot damn!
Those boys out there are red-assed as hell.

1052
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:33,955
Where in God's name have you been?
The show starts in 10 minutes, for Christ's sake.

1053
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:37,589
-Unfinished business, Sid. Very important.
-No, l am Sam.

1054
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,428
-l thought you were Sid.
-Sam.

1055
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:42,469
Whatever. There's a lot of 'em
out there, ain't there?

1056
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:44,198
lt's got to stop.

1057
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:47,673
They poured tar on my lawn yesterday,
then they set it on fire.

1058
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:50,711
Yeah! They slashed the tires on Sid's car!

1059
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,837
-l thought you said you were Sid.
-l'm Sam.

1060
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:55,508
-Sid, l told you they're dangerous lunatics.
-Sam!

1061
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:56,606
-Sid.
-Sam.

1062
01:20:56,718 --> 01:21:00,984
-Sid! You got to call the cops.
-No! That's not<i>....</i>

1063
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:04,419
l had a call from
the Albanian Liberation Organi<i>z</i>ation.

1064
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,859
Something real bad-ass nasty's gonna happen.
This guy says--

1065
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:10,693
-Sid, they're bluffing. l know it.
-Sam!

1066
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:12,661
Sid talked to those guys.

1067
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:14,701
-Don't you mean Sam?
-No, Sid!

1068
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:18,567
He met with their top people
and he made them promises.

1069
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:22,733
And from now on, every script
has to be read and approved by Sam!

1070
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:24,402
Then you are Sid.

1071
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:28,344
No, no. l meant Sid.

1072
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,177
No, l'm Sam. l must have meant Sid.

1073
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:35,047
And he said, ''No more Albanian jokes.''

1074
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:36,982
-Who said?
-Sid said.

1075
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:38,690
-Sid said?
-Sid said!

1076
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,226
-Sam said.
-So you are Sid.

1077
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:49,860
No, l'm Sam! Pedro, l mean it!

1078
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:53,338
They got us by the balls.

1079
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:55,409
l mean, one in each hand.

1080
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:57,778
Pedro, you write so good.

1081
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:02,816
You don't need this Albanian crap.

1082
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:11,550
Brilliant script.

1083
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,394
Grade A quality. lsn't it, guys?

1084
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:24,199
That's what we need.
Just the sort of stuff you do so well.

1085
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:28,436
And thanks for dropping the Albanian stuff.
You know what they said?

1086
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:31,337
One more joke, they'd torch the place.

1087
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:34,914
Can you imagine?
l mean, where's their sense of humor?

1088
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:36,608
They ain't got none.

1089
01:22:36,718 --> 01:22:39,949
Yeah? Yeah, that's why it's best
not to mess with them at all.

1090
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,784
Excuse me, Sam. l...

1091
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:44,882
...have to take a leak before we go on.

1092
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:47,291
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1093
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:50,728
-We only got three minutes.
-We're behind you, Pedro.

1094
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:52,328
-Yes.
-You bet!

1095
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:53,799
We need you.

1096
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:57,228
Thanks, guys. Thanks for everything.

1097
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:05,075
And l'm behind you!

1098
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:13,785
<i>-Hello, Martin. Can you get it?</i>
-Yeah, l can get it.

1099
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,821
Listen, l found out where she's staying.

1100
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:19,792
28 Chapelle. Yeah.

1101
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:24,460
lt's Ted Orson's townhouse. Good luck, son.

1102
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:38,870
That's that fire alarm.

1103
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:44,514
You bastards.

1104
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,918
You Albanian bastards.

1105
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:52,616
This is an evacuation. Everybody evacuate!

1106
01:23:52,827 --> 01:23:57,264
Take your buddy's hand. This is not a drill!
Evacuate, please.

1107
01:23:57,465 --> 01:24:01,561
-l've got to get my brother Sid. Come with me.
-Open the doors.

1108
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:25,792
We apologi<i>z</i>e for that short interruption.

1109
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:28,761
A small technical hitch here at the studio.

1110
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:30,755
And now we continue...

1111
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:34,460
...with our enormously popular
nighttime serial...

1112
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:37,938
<i>...Kings of the Garden District.</i>

1113
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:06,894
<i>Elmore Dubuque, his young and fevered mind</i>
<i>driven to near madness...</i>

1114
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:10,596
<i>...by his forbidden love</i>
<i>for his mother-in-law Margaret...</i>

1115
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:13,473
<i>...contemplates desperate measures.</i>

1116
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:18,978
<i>Meanwhile, for Dr. Albert Quince</i>
<i>in his storm-battered clinic...</i>

1117
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:21,446
<i>...time is running out.</i>

1118
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:24,611
Uncle Albert!

1119
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:29,122
-More oxygen. Push, Elena, push.
-l'm only four months pregnant!

1120
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:33,058
l know it's a little premature,
but our time is running out.

1121
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:37,196
Uncle Albert, you're a brain surgeon,
for heaven's sake!

1122
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:39,994
Don't worry about that now, girl. Push!

1123
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:47,966
Elmore, thank God that awful car crash
was only a dream.

1124
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:50,975
l want you.

1125
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:53,972
l must have you.

1126
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,743
Elmore, that is your wife lying there.

1127
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,550
And my husband's just yards away.

1128
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:03,590
l know that, honey. That's what excites me.

1129
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,088
lt excites me, too.

1130
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:08,123
Elmore<i>....</i>

1131
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:13,832
Nurse, swab.

1132
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:21,430
Wait a minute.
There's something strange going on here.

1133
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:23,975
Who are you?

1134
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:27,408
Richard!

1135
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:29,642
Yes, Uncle Albert, it is l.

1136
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:33,945
-Richard.
-Richard, darling.

1137
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:37,590
This is my child.
l have a right to be present at its birth.

1138
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,660
You swine!

1139
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:42,795
Come on, Margaret. We're calling the police.

1140
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:45,832
Richard, Uncle Albert is trying to induce me...

1141
01:26:45,934 --> 01:26:48,232
...even though l'm only four months pregnant.

1142
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:51,703
You keep your filthy hands off her, you...

1143
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:54,465
...gynecologist.

1144
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:00,945
-This is madness.
-Albert.

1145
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:04,118
l feel so ashamed.

1146
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:06,887
My own son and daughter.

1147
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:14,620
l can't stand to see my brother in so much pain.

1148
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:18,890
-There's something l have to tell you.
-What is it, Albert?

1149
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:23,397
Remember in '32, when you were
putting down the rat epidemic in Baton Rouge?

1150
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:24,562
Yes.

1151
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,601
Something happened between...

1152
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:29,637
...Margaret and me.

1153
01:27:30,478 --> 01:27:32,207
Something beautiful.

1154
01:27:33,781 --> 01:27:36,477
Robert, Elena's not your daughter, she's mine.

1155
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:40,281
Albert! No!

1156
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:41,950
Margaret.

1157
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:45,083
Not my daughter?

1158
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:48,361
Richard! Darling! lsn't that wonderful?

1159
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,898
That means we're cousins!

1160
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:54,399
You'll always be a sister to me, Elena.

1161
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:57,037
Verminous mongrel!

1162
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:02,542
l always knew l couldn't trust you.

1163
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:05,574
But now l know why!

1164
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:08,378
l found this letter...

1165
01:28:09,317 --> 01:28:12,013
...written by my mother on her deathbed.

1166
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:15,621
When you were a baby,
she found you in a beat-up crate...

1167
01:28:15,723 --> 01:28:18,954
...by the cesspool behind our hovel...

1168
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,551
...in the slums of the Batture!

1169
01:28:22,597 --> 01:28:25,828
You are not my brother, Albert!

1170
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:30,200
That's right, l am not
your brother Albert, Robert.

1171
01:28:30,371 --> 01:28:32,339
But l wrote that letter.

1172
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:35,167
And your mother isn't dead.

1173
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:40,070
Richard, we are not even cousins.

1174
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:43,878
Free, free, free at last, my love.

1175
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:47,079
Evening, everybody.
l got here as quick as l could.

1176
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:54,785
Excuse me, sir.

1177
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:58,524
There's an Albanian outside.

1178
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:02,596
And he's doing something unnatural
to your German Shepherd.

1179
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:07,670
<i>Leaving the Quince family</i>
<i>still numb with shock...</i>

1180
01:29:08,209 --> 01:29:10,769
<i>...the gallant policeman runs to a squalid alley...</i>

1181
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:13,745
<i>...inhabited only by rats, garbage...</i>

1182
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:16,746
<i>...and Albanians.</i>

1183
01:29:28,096 --> 01:29:32,294
Good Lord, man, what in the hell do you think
you're doin' to my dog?

1184
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:41,807
Sorry, officer.
l saw your beautiful, strong Shepherd...

1185
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:46,680
...and l have overpowering desire.

1186
01:29:46,781 --> 01:29:49,614
l love animal, all animal.

1187
01:29:49,951 --> 01:29:52,146
Dog, pig, goat...

1188
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,244
...even chicken.

1189
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:57,449
l love little fluffy chicken.

1190
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:00,617
Good Lord above, man, that's no excuse.

1191
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:03,663
What reason can you give for this abomination?

1192
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:06,529
ls easy explanation, sir.

1193
01:30:07,168 --> 01:30:12,003
ls old Albanian custom to love animal
in such a way.

1194
01:30:16,878 --> 01:30:19,142
Break it down with the hatchet.

1195
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:33,056
<i>Robert, no. What are you doing?</i>
<i>Put that gun away.</i>

1196
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:36,756
<i>Take it easy, sir.</i>
<i>l've been watching you for days.</i>

1197
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:40,891
<i>-l know everything. lt's disgustin'</i>/
<i>-Elmore, take the gun. Grab it</i>/

1198
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:42,594
<i>Give me that gun</i>/

1199
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:50,666
He killed him. Elmore, you killed my husband.

1200
01:30:52,747 --> 01:30:56,080
Robert, don't die.

1201
01:30:57,685 --> 01:30:59,118
Margaret<i>....</i>

1202
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:07,725
<i>l had to kill him.</i>
<i>l could never have you while he lived.</i>

1203
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:11,663
<i>l can't bear the thought</i>
<i>of you being with another man.</i>

1204
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:13,927
<i>Margaret, l love you.</i>

1205
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:19,105
<i>Take your hands off me.</i>
<i>l hate you. l never want to see you again.</i>

1206
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:21,442
<i>You're sick</i>/ <i>You're mad</i>/

1207
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:31,484
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1208
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:35,979
<i>lf l can't have you, my darlin', then nobody will.</i>

1209
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:38,986
<i>No, Elmore. Put that gun down, please.</i>

1210
01:31:39,527 --> 01:31:41,586
<i>Please</i>/ <i>What are you....</i>

1211
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:43,891
<i>No, don't</i>/ <i>Don't</i>/

1212
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:56,306
Elmore, l beg you on my hands and knees.
You say you love me.

1213
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:58,574
How can you kill me if you love me?

1214
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:01,410
<i>Margaret, hate burns like love</i>/

1215
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,641
<i>Love burns like hate.</i>

1216
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:20,199
lt's because l love you that l'm doing this.

1217
01:32:20,635 --> 01:32:22,603
We all kill the thing we love.

1218
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:26,705
You're such a real man.

1219
01:32:28,676 --> 01:32:31,338
l really go for you. You go for me, too?

1220
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:06,608
Margaret.

1221
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:09,480
My darlin'.

1222
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,883
lt's better this way.

1223
01:33:47,088 --> 01:33:48,555
My God! What?

1224
01:33:51,826 --> 01:33:53,293
You scared me!

1225
01:33:57,732 --> 01:33:59,359
l had to see you.

1226
01:34:01,836 --> 01:34:03,804
l can't stand it, Julia.

1227
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:07,937
l can't bear to be without you.

1228
01:34:09,777 --> 01:34:11,711
l can't bear it, either.

1229
01:34:27,294 --> 01:34:29,125
What the hell is that?

1230
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:30,522
Damn!

1231
01:34:32,133 --> 01:34:35,193
-lt's a gun.
-Yeah, l can see it's a gun.

1232
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:41,136
Pedro told me to bring it.
l was going to scare Orson.

1233
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:44,077
l don't know.

1234
01:34:44,845 --> 01:34:47,370
l think l might've even shot myself.

1235
01:34:48,382 --> 01:34:49,406
Boy.

1236
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,847
Where is Orson, anyway?

1237
01:34:55,456 --> 01:34:57,083
Ted? l don't know.

1238
01:34:57,625 --> 01:35:00,560
-But you were with him this afternoon.
-Yeah.

1239
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:03,653
l was saying goodbye to him this afternoon.

1240
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:07,962
-But you were staying at his house!
-No, Pedro found me a place to stay.

1241
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:09,502
-Pedro?
-Yeah.

1242
01:35:10,938 --> 01:35:13,771
-But this is Orson's car, right?
-No.

1243
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:16,636
lt's Pedro's car.

1244
01:35:16,944 --> 01:35:19,742
Pedro's car? Where you goin'?

1245
01:35:22,316 --> 01:35:23,749
The back seat.

1246
01:35:25,853 --> 01:35:29,448
There it is, the burned-out shell of WXBU...

1247
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:32,617
...already looking like a relic from times past.

1248
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,555
And your name, sir?

1249
01:35:35,196 --> 01:35:37,926
Big John Coot, Voice of New Orleans.
Everybody knows that.

1250
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:42,401
His name's Pedro Carmichael. You just shoot
him on sight now, the minute you see him!

1251
01:35:42,503 --> 01:35:44,095
-Shoot him on sight!
-Sir?

1252
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:49,433
Did you find his body yet?
lt's a little squidgy one, about that big.

1253
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:52,944
No, sir, not yet. But we did find this.

1254
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:55,313
ls it a clue?

1255
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:58,249
My damn brother. l wonder where he got to.

1256
01:35:58,352 --> 01:36:01,287
Now you keep right on looking for Carmichael.

1257
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:03,620
-Yes, sir.
-Carmichael!

1258
01:36:06,494 --> 01:36:07,859
You bastard!

1259
01:36:08,529 --> 01:36:13,398
l'm offering $500 for any part of his body,
no matter how small!

1260
01:36:38,092 --> 01:36:41,619
-Where did you learn to do that?
-Right here, last night.

1261
01:36:42,263 --> 01:36:43,821
Get out of town.

1262
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:48,360
You know l can't live without you now,
don't you?

1263
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:51,294
You're never going to have to.

1264
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:52,765
Come here.

1265
01:36:52,873 --> 01:36:56,206
-Where we going?
-Come here. We're going right here.

1266
01:36:56,577 --> 01:36:58,067
-Come here.
-Yeah.

1267
01:36:59,513 --> 01:37:02,107
We are gonna make love one more time.

1268
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:06,610
And then we're gonna pack our bags
and go away.

1269
01:37:08,722 --> 01:37:09,780
We're gonna get married.

1270
01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:11,448
-For real?
-For real.

1271
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:12,583
Good.

1272
01:37:12,693 --> 01:37:16,561
-And l'm going to write. l'm gonna be a writer.
-l'm gonna be a singer.

1273
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,291
You're gonna what?

1274
01:37:18,732 --> 01:37:20,563
l'm gonna be a singer.

1275
01:37:20,968 --> 01:37:22,663
-You can sing?
-Yes.

1276
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:27,031
-When did you learn to sing?
-Right here, last night.

1277
01:37:42,089 --> 01:37:43,920
-No, no.
-Damn.

1278
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:46,885
-lt's my father!
-Come on! Here.

1279
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:51,695
-Where's your shirt?
-How you doin'?

1280
01:37:51,799 --> 01:37:55,064
l'm doing okay. Here are your shoes.

1281
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:00,530
Come on, the blanket!

1282
01:38:00,674 --> 01:38:02,665
-What?
-Pull in the blanket!

1283
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:21,823
Hi, guys.

1284
01:38:23,097 --> 01:38:24,724
That was a squeaker!

1285
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:27,426
-What happened?
-You look weird.

1286
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:30,128
lt got a little hot down there at the station.

1287
01:38:30,237 --> 01:38:33,832
-l don't know what the big idea is--
-l got to talk to you.

1288
01:38:33,941 --> 01:38:38,275
l got two do<i>z</i>en red-ass cops on my tail
that haven't got time for the story of my life!

1289
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:40,438
-l don't understand--
-Ted Orson's car?

1290
01:38:40,547 --> 01:38:43,482
-You give a guy in love a gun?
-Ted Orson's house?

1291
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,984
-l could have shot her!
-He could have shot me!

1292
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:54,289
l see a lot of reality impacting here.
That's good. l like that.

1293
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:57,360
Anyway...

1294
01:38:58,132 --> 01:38:59,759
...l got to haul ass.

1295
01:39:01,502 --> 01:39:04,528
Pedro! This time you are not gonna get--

1296
01:39:21,021 --> 01:39:25,117
Cardinal Peter Carmichael, l think.

1297
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:26,650
Yes.

1298
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:29,295
Yes, that would be good.

1299
01:39:29,797 --> 01:39:33,028
My goodness, darlin'. My goodness.

1300
01:39:33,567 --> 01:39:35,933
l had no idea you were here.

1301
01:39:37,404 --> 01:39:39,269
God love you, child.

1302
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:42,238
And peace to you, too, son.

1303
01:39:44,511 --> 01:39:46,604
l want you to know...

1304
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:50,648
...l haven't figured it out yet,
just exactly what you did, but l will.

1305
01:39:50,751 --> 01:39:54,448
Come on. Without me, you guys'd still
be holding hands in the movies.

1306
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:57,581
l got to run. Goodbye, Julia.

1307
01:39:58,859 --> 01:40:01,089
Look after this little sapsucker, here.

1308
01:40:01,195 --> 01:40:03,686
-l'll try.
-Keep writing, son.

1309
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:08,093
You remember what l told you.
Life is a shitstorm...

1310
01:40:08,769 --> 01:40:11,101
...and when it's raining shit...

1311
01:40:11,205 --> 01:40:13,969
...the best umbrella you can buy is art.

1312
01:40:14,441 --> 01:40:15,669
Damn right.

1313
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:21,241
Wait a second, man. Where are you going?
What are you going to do?

1314
01:40:21,615 --> 01:40:24,209
New York. Television.

1315
01:40:24,351 --> 01:40:26,876
That's where the rubber
hits the road these days.

1316
01:40:26,987 --> 01:40:29,854
-Television? You're sure?
-What about the Albanians?

1317
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:32,118
Albanians? What about 'em?

1318
01:40:33,093 --> 01:40:34,958
Fine outstanding race.

1319
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:37,288
l love the Albanian people.

1320
01:40:37,931 --> 01:40:40,422
l'm half Albanian myself, for God's sake.

1321
01:40:40,534 --> 01:40:43,833
-You are?
-But the Norwegians, now...

1322
01:40:44,104 --> 01:40:47,164
...talk about depraved! God!

1323
01:40:47,741 --> 01:40:49,800
The things that they'll do.

1324
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:52,011
lt'd make a maggot gag.

1325
01:40:52,746 --> 01:40:55,681
-Listen, l got to go.
-Wait a second, man!

1326
01:40:57,918 --> 01:41:00,148
What about you? Are you gonna be okay?

1327
01:41:00,254 --> 01:41:01,949
Am l gonna be okay?

1328
01:41:03,857 --> 01:41:06,291
Does a frog have a waterproof ass?

1329
01:41:07,428 --> 01:41:08,452
Yes!

1330
01:41:19,573 --> 01:41:20,597
Bye!

1331
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,585
-Good luck.
-Thank you!

1332
01:41:48,068 --> 01:41:52,664
-Were you serious about your singing?
-l never joke about my singing. Why?

1333
01:41:54,074 --> 01:41:55,234
Well...

1334
01:41:56,210 --> 01:41:59,873
...the French love American songs.

1335
01:42:01,582 --> 01:42:04,745
Good. They're the only kind l know.

1336
01:42:06,386 --> 01:42:11,346
You'll sing at night, and l'll write.
And in the morning, we'll make love...

1337
01:42:12,392 --> 01:42:17,261
...and walk in the Bois de Boulogne,
and people will watch us walking together...

1338
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:20,193
-...and they'll say--
-''He's too young for her.''

1339
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,063
