00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,826
You all right?

197
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,130
Yeah. I'm good.

198
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:12,631
Thanks.

199
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,938
Yo, what was that irf like?

200
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,107
Loud.

201
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,442
Shit.

202
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,610
You didn't think I could

203
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,911
handle it?

204
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,412
No, that's not what I'm

205
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,614
trying to say.

206
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,015
You know, I just didn't think

207
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,850
you'd want to.

208
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,218
I got to say, of all the

209
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,620
companies I've rotated through

210
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:35,621
here, I never had someone get

211
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,290
their ticket punched on the

212
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,491
first day.

213
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,926
Just be glad it wasn't a shit

214
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,261
cocktail.

215
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,363
What's a shit cocktail?

216
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,998
What the fuck do you think

217
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,101
that is, rico?

218
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,671
Hey, cole, what happened?

219
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:53,905
Uh.

220
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,508
We... we followed two other guys

221
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:56,975
in, and, um, I was on the left

222
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,276
arm.

223
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:58,644
It was my only thing, and I

224
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,479
went...

225
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,147
pop! She got an elbow right

226
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:02,681
to the lip... knocked her mask

227
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:05,283
clean off.

228
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,686
Ohh, does it hurt?

229
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:08,954
Yeah, it fucking hurts.

230
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,322
It looks pretty bad.

231
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,990
Did medical check it out?

232
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,293
It's fine.

233
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,962
You know what it looks like?

234
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:17,963
It looks like you got herpes.

235
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,131
Hey, no.

236
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,166
Oh, shit!

237
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:21,807
It kind of does.

238
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,903
You guys. No.

239
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,204
You're not gonna get any on

240
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,606
the island now, cole.

241
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:28,674
Fuck that... I'd hit it,

242
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:29,975
anyway.

243
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,180
What do you say, cole?

244
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,014
Well, then, I really would

245
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,182
get herpes.

246
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,384
Ohh!

247
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,020
Thank you!

248
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:42,702
She got you...

249
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,591
Oh, damn. Whoo!

250
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,723
Mom?

251
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:21,026
<i>Oh!</i>

252
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,462
<i>Honey, how are you?</i>

253
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:27,032
Well, things are fine.

254
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,133
Um, the base is real nice.

255
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,167
There's a subway.

256
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,303
<i>A subway?</i>

257
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,972
A subway restaurant, mom.

258
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,208
<i>Oh!</i>

259
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:36,742
<i>Yeah. And is that your room?</i>

260
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,910
Yeah.

261
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,713
<i>Can I see it?</i>

262
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,149
How is everything back home,

263
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,151
mom?

264
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:49,087
<i>Oh. Nothing much ever happens</i>

265
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,489
<i>back here... nothing as</i>

266
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,189
<i>exciting as what you're doing,</i>

267
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,724
<i>i'm sure.</i>

268
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,994
It is what it is.

269
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,996
I don't know. I, um...

270
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,731
<i>Honey, you can't just leave</i>

271
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,533
<i>him hanging and expect him to</i>

272
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,001
<i>be there when you get back.</i>

273
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,069
I'm not leaving him hanging,

274
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,603
and I told you I'm not coming

275
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,004
back.

276
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,239
I'm going on another deployment,

277
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,441
remember?

278
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,276
<i>All right.</i>

279
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,211
<i>So, how about on the base?</i>

280
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,180
<i>Have you met anyone down there?</i>

281
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,282
Mom, seriously, stop.

282
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,717
I'm not dating an army guy, and

283
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,152
I did not join the military to

284
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,787
find a husband.

285
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:22,687
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

286
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:23,522
<i>Oh!</i>

287
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,760
<i>Look who wants to say hello.</i>

288
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,028
<i>Say hi, scribbles.</i>

289
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:30,762
<i>Look who it is!</i>

290
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,065
<i>Look who it is!</i>

291
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,200
<i>Say hi, scribbles.</i>

292
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:46,545
The weather today... bright and

293
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:50,282
sunny.

294
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,716
High of 85...

295
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,387
Tomorrow, there is a chance of

296
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,122
rain...

297
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,123
Thank you, private.

298
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,292
Last week...

299
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,269
Come down here.

300
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,737
Make sure you...%-

301
00:16:58,651 --> 00:16:59,718
uh.

302
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,660
You want a book?

303
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,928
Do you want a book?

304
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:22,567
Hey, calm down.

305
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,401
Calm down.

306
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,736
Take a step back.

307
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:25,470
Take one step back from the

308
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,571
glass.

309
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,206
I can't understand what...

310
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,641
yo, haji!

311
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,942
Chill the fuck out.

312
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,443
I'll take that book, but you

313
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,510
give it to me.

314
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,478
All right, all right.

315
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,480
Chill out.

316
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:40,585
I got this.

317
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,692
Did I do something wrong?

318
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,527
No. These guys just don't

319
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,530
like girls.

320
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,733
It's an arab thing.

321
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,401
You want me to take over?

322
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:57,535
No. It's okay.

323
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,603
I can handle it.

324
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,838
All right.

325
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,840
Suit yourself.

326
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,838
Do you know those books?

327
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,808
What about them?

328
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,276
Do you like them?

329
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,345
You were watching the books.

330
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,415
I'm asking you a question.

331
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,451
What do you want from the

332
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,886
cart?

333
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:51,256
Do you have the new

334
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,492
<i>harry potter book?</i>

335
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,096
No. This is not the new

336
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,064
<i>harry potter book.</i>

337
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,699
This is the old one.

338
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,803
I already read this one.

339
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,604
I want the last book.

340
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,373
Which one's that?

341
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,908
The last book?

342
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:10,809
It's, you know... you... you see

343
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,344
that book there?

344
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,746
It has no cover on it, huh?

345
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:15,880
Uh-huh, yes.

346
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,082
That book... it used to have a

347
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,783
cover.

348
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,385
I remember I read this cover,

349
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:20,885
you know, when it has a cover on

350
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,487
it.

351
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,689
It was saying that <i>harry potter,</i>

352
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,492
it has seven book, you know?

353
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:27,792
You guys only have six book.

354
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:28,860
Huh?

355
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:29,360
I don't know what to tell

356
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,528
you... I...

357
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,830
you know how long I'm asking

358
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,064
for this book?

359
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,032
No, you don't.

360
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,366
You're new.

361
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,535
Two years.

362
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,037
Imagine, two years I'm asking

363
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:39,838
you guys to give me this last

364
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,106
book.

365
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,073
You know what happens at the end

366
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:42,774
of book six?

367
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:43,942
No.

368
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:44,476
No.

369
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,744
I...

370
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,146
you know, me, always, always

371
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,514
thinking that snape is a bad

372
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,149
guy, okay?

373
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,784
Then I was thinking, no,

374
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,018
actually, he is not a bad guy...

375
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,020
he is the good guy.

376
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,155
Then after I read the book six,

377
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,591
I don't know what to think now.

378
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,127
Do you want this book or not?

379
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,061
You're not listening, huh?

380
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:03,461
I read this book...

381
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,395
No, no.

382
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,864
<i>You are not listening tome.</i>

383
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:06,798
10 times.

384
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,765
I read this book.

385
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,833
I want the new book.

386
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,400
I'm telling you we don't have

387
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,068
it.

388
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,170
It ain't here.

389
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:17,942
What we have is on the cart.

390
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,444
What do you want?

391
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,446
Give me the "azkaban"

392
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,415
instead.

393
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:26,484
Is that one of these arab

394
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,687
books?

395
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,626
"Prisoner of azkaban," book

396
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,728
number three.

397
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,003
Yeah.

398
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:47,906
Here you go.

399
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,407
Hey. What... what...

400
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,608
what else do you got?

401
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,509
I got books, and I got

402
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,478
newspapers.

403
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,812
Use your eyes.

404
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,481
I'm using my eyes.

405
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,015
That newspaper is two months

406
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,483
old.

407
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,584
Now, why do I have to know the

408
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:00,752
news for two months old?

409
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,454
So, you're good then?

410
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,456
Hold on your horses, huh?

411
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,192
No one is going nowhere here...

412
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:10,895
at least, I'm not.

413
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,998
What is that picture?

414
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,667
That book.

415
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,568
No, no, go.

416
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:17,468
Go, go.

417
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,136
Go.

418
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,537
Too much.

419
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:23,641
Go back.

420
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,811
Uh-huh.

421
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,781
What is it?

422
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:32,217
"My antonia."

423
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:32,884
Is it a good book or...

424
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,219
I don't know.

425
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,787
I haven't read it.

426
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,856
Okay. Just tell me what the

427
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:44,162
cover says, on the back.

428
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:47,031
"In 19th century nebraska,

429
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,632
the spirited daughter of an

430
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,500
immigrant..."

431
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,536
nebraska?

432
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,837
You said... what was it?

433
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,906
It... it's a place in

434
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,542
america.

435
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,776
Okay. Uh-huh.

436
00:22:58,777 --> 00:22:59,577
That... what kind of place is

437
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,078
this?

438
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,483
Nebraska?

439
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,651
Flat.

440
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:07,152
Flat.

441
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:08,486
Time's up.

442
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,053
Hey.

443
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,022
Keep it moving.

444
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:14,592
Hey, I... moptop?

445
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:15,627
Bad timing, okay?

446
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:16,594
Me and blondie... we were

447
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,095
having a very beautiful

448
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:17,695
conversation.

449
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,297
Uh-huh.

450
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:21,266
And you come here always

451
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,166
trying to be a big fucking

452
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:22,867
asshole.

453
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,569
You know what?

454
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,304
I think you guys don't have the

455
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,506
last <i>harry potter</i> on purpose.

456
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,541
You like to drive us crazy.

457
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,743
But I'm not going crazy.

458
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,979
Huh? Happy me.

459
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,981
I'm not going crazy... not me!

460
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,554
At 2100, detainees on

461
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:17,989
charlie block complained of a

462
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,656
foul-smelling odor coming from

463
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,658
ventilation.

464
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,127
Maintenance was called.

465
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,329
At 2200, detainee 9-1-2 was

466
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,030
found with seven strings of

467
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,098
different colors.

468
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,800
He appeared to be weaving them

469
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,702
together, possibly to form a

470
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:33,004
weapon.

471
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,572
At 0500, detainee 4-9 was

472
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,206
transferred to medical for pain

473
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,608
in the abdomen.

474
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,077
Diagnosis was constipation.

475
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,111
We have 3-6 moves scheduled,

476
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,612
3-8 moves completed.

477
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:42,613
All detainees accounted for.

478
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:43,748
Atten-hut!

479
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,217
Honor bound.

480
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,219
To defend freedom.

481
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,647
Hey, blondie, tell me...

482
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:53,017
how do you like it here so far?

483
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,186
Huh?

484
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,726
Blondie.

485
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,429
Where are you from?

486
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,102
Okay, tell me your name.

487
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:11,603
No?

488
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,044
My name is ali... ali amir.

489
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:23,915
Here, they call me 4-7-1.

490
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,719
You don't like to talk?

491
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,188
Always, it's like that. Why?

492
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:33,458
I don't know why you guys...

493
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,927
you don't like to talk with us.

494
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:36,928
You and us... we are both stuck

495
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,263
here.

496
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,698
It is boring for both of us.

497
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:44,001
And you and me got nothing

498
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,703
to say to each other.

499
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,105
Okay. You don't like to read

500
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,040
<i>harry potter book?</i>

501
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,942
You don't like to read that book

502
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:51,976
about... what was that place,

503
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,479
the flat place?

504
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,481
Uh, nebraska?

505
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:59,283
Tell me what you like to read,

506
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,384
huh?

507
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,453
Oh!

508
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,288
You are a soldier.

509
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,524
And soldiers... they don't like

510
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,059
books.

511
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,427
I thought you only read

512
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,796
the qur'an.

513
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,131
The qur'an, yes.

514
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,799
We... I-I've read it

515
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,500
one million times.

516
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:19,237
You know what?

517
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,205
Ehan, there in 108... he has

518
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,740
memorized it, the whole book.

519
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,542
Hey, ehan!

520
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:27,778
Tell something to blondie from

521
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,914
the qur'an.

522
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,422
I think he's trying to tell

523
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,323
you to leave me alone.

524
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,392
Ehan!

525
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,000
Hey, blondie.

526
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,302
You know, I read your bible,

527
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:54,805
too.

528
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,440
My opinion about bible is the

529
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,875
first half of the book... it is

530
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,579
very good.

531
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,482
It has armies, plenty of magic,

532
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:05,149
which I like very much... things

533
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,317
like that.

534
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,486
But, you know, the second

535
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:09,587
half... it has some magic, but

536
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:11,022
not too much.

537
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,256
It is boring.

538
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,258
Well, you don't diss my

539
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:20,531
holy book... I won't diss yours.

540
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:26,837
So you're christian?

541
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,839
Tell me something... how did you

542
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,809
pick your christianity?

543
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,581
It was your parents, hmm?

544
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:37,815
And cut the hannibal lecter

545
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,419
shit.

546
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,487
Just keep it down.

547
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,032
What?

548
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,452
What is hannibal lecter?

549
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,587
I said, keep it down.

550
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:50,955
Yeah. I'm... I'm trying to

551
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:51,255
understand what you are telling

552
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,923
me.

553
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,392
You were saying that stop

554
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:55,693
hannibal lecter, so I have to

555
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:56,894
know what hannibal lecter is,

556
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,529
then I stop doing that.

557
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,064
He's a guy in a movie that

558
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,932
talks too much.

559
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,601
I haven't heard about this

560
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,002
movie.

561
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,971
Well, it's probably banned

562
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,975
where you're from, anyway.

563
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:11,942
You mean in germany?

564
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:12,710
Huh?

565
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,045
I'm... hey.

566
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:14,945
I'm... hey!

567
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,684
I'm talking with you, blondie!

568
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,919
Okay. I-I-it's... it's no more

569
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,321
talking, huh?

570
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,256
Huh?

571
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:28,225
You are always trying to be all

572
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,127
of you assholes.

573
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,010
I don't know how I cannot get

574
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,012
one soldier here who likes to

575
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,182
talk about books.

576
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,519
Okay. You don't like to talk.

577
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,356
Bring me some water, please.

578
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,562
Blondie. I'm thirsty.

579
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,097
Where's your qur'an?

580
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:09,967
Are you giving me some water,

581
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,268
please, or not?

582
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,671
Okay, you bring me the water...

583
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:21,672
I stop talking, I promise.

584
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:35,726
You wouldn't need this if you

585
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,494
didn't talk so damn much.

586
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:40,331
Ah!

587
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,580
Shit.

588
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,315
Shit. Are you all right?

589
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,216
Oh, man, let me help you.

590
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,084
Motherfucker.

591
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:00,785
Clean yourself up.

592
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:02,052
We'll take care of this.

593
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:02,686
Hey, back the fuck up and

594
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:03,687
shut the bean hole.

595
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,055
He's probably got another

596
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,791
cocktail.

597
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,059
Oh, fuck.

598
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:19,837
Quiet down.

599
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:20,371
4-7-1, take the towel down

600
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:21,272
now.

601
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,239
Fuck you!

602
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,673
Take it down now!

603
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,176
No, no.

604
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:28,045
We need to call an irf.

605
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:28,846
Hold on.

606
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:29,680
Open that thing.

607
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,347
No, no. No.

608
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,182
We need to call an irf.

609
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,216
Calm down.

610
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:32,650
I'm already covered in his

611
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,083
shit!

612
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:33,851
Open it up!

613
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:35,052
We are not opening the

614
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,053
fucking bean hole.

615
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,121
Now, you need to calm down.

616
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,390
No, we are not opening that

617
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:42,526
up.

618
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,328
You stupid fuckers... Huh?!

619
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,798
I went to university!

620
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,467
I know my rights!

621
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:55,172
Hey, back up, fucker!

622
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,408
Shit.

00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,211

624
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:04,515
"F" you.

625
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:06,183
Do it!

626
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,265
Back away from the door.

627
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:15,893
Nice. Nice, nice. Nice, nice.

628
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:16,327
Good, good, good, good, good.

629
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,696
Good.

630
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:19,497
Yeah, bitch.

631
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,798
Nice.

632
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:21,131
Shit, he's got a second

633
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:21,832
towel.

634
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,736
Seriously?

635
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:27,171
Fuck.

636
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:30,875
Shit, man.

637
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,178
Irf him.

638
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:34,845
You americans treat us like

639
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,714
animals?!

640
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,215
Okay, I am an animal!

641
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,250
Bravo two, code one,

642
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:44,588
charlie bronson.

643
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,558
Oh, watch yourselves.

644
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,759
If they start covering their

645
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,761
qur'ans, it means they're gonna

646
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,196
start throwing shit around!

647
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:52,897
You don't read anything!

648
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:54,365
I read book!

649
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,299
I read history!

650
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,669
I can't win!

651
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,645
Irf! Irf! Irf!

652
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,704
Cocktail?

653
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:36,674
Sir, yes, sir.

654
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:40,244
At ease.

655
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:43,380
Did medical check you out yet?

656
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,516
Yes, sir. I'm fine.

657
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,358
Why don't you, uh, take it easy

658
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:55,659
for the rest of the shift?

659
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,729
See if observation needs any

660
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,763
help.

661
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,199
Thank you, sir.

662
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,469
I'm fine.

663
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:07,271
Use the vinegar.

664
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:12,676
It helps with the smell.

665
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,594
Hey.

666
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:31,829
Mmm. Cole, you smell amazing.

667
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,530
What's that you're wearing...

668
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,932
chanel no. 2?

669
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,266
Mm-hmm.

670
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,001
You better watch yourself with

671
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:37,868
those.

672
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,336
They drug them to keep them

673
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:40,938
docile.

674
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:42,706
Shit. No, they don't.

675
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,376
Hey. What are you doing here?

676
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:46,343
Did medical check you out?

677
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,778
I'm fine.

678
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:48,746
We're short a meal, though.

679
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:49,913
Do you mind grabbing one?

680
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,982
No, we're not.

681
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,550
Your pal 471... he's not coming

682
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,284
back today.

683
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,020
Why?

684
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:57,287
I sent him on a flyer.

685
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,456
What's that?

686
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,325
Our frequent flyer program.

687
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,493
We move him from cell to cell

688
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,727
every two hours.

689
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,361
Night shift won't like it, but

690
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:07,331
fuck 'em.

691
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,899
Dude's got to learn somehow.

692
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,801
You move him all night long?

693
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,569
All night, all day, all week.

694
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,038
How does he sleep?

695
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,339
He doesn't, dummy... that's

696
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,840
the point.

697
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,675
Come on, get this shit moving.

698
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,343
We're on a schedule.

699
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,577
It's brutal.

700
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,779
What are you...

701
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,746
the red cross?

702
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:23,747
No, I'm just saying.

703
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:24,882
It's... Brutal.

704
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,316
I mean, jesus, rico, cole

705
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,284
just got shit flung at her face.

706
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:27,885
Are you cool with that?

707
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,286
Of course not.

708
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:29,887
I mean, you don't have to do

709
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,522
some big thing over me.

710
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,890
I'm... I'm fine.

711
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:34,324
Yeah, we kind of do.

712
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,592
And just so we're clear, I'm

713
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:39,496
down with it.%-I just think, you know, it's

714
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:42,833
kind of hard-core, right?

715
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,835
You want me to call it off?

716
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,437
No. Fuck him.

717
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:00,851
Look at you pussies swim!

718
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,820
Rico, get the ladder.

719
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:03,887

You want me to bait it for you?

Thanks.

737
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,387

on all three.

742
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,362
Like that?

743
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,698
Not bad.

744
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:48,565
Hey, give me this shit.

745
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,399
Hold this.

746
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,136
How do you do this thing,

747
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,470
anyways?

748
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:53,871
How do you do the pole?

749
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:54,538
Yeah.

750
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,140
Yo, I've never done this

751
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:57,508
before, man.

752
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:58,408
Look, the hook's right there.

753
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:58,942
You got to put bait on it.

754
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,677
Oh.

755
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:01,745
You cast the fucker out, get

756
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,026
a fish, and you reel it back in.

757
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:04,782
Real simple.

758
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,649
Shit, be my guest.

759
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,083
Pulling your ass out of

760
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:09,153
there.

761
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:12,523
There you go.

762
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,524
I like to see the hook.

763
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:16,059
Well, see that?

764
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,427
He knows what kind of fish...

765
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,001
Here you go.

766
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,170
Thanks.

767

960
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,496
I will put it in the box and...

961
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:22,765
hey, I can't.

962
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:23,446
I'm sorry.

963
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,313
Why?

964
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,415
You... you... you think this

965
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:43,119
paper will hurt you somehow,

966
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,787
huh?

967
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:48,357
Huh? You think that I will kill

968
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:49,592
you with this piece of paper?

969
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,828
Huh? You say the rules.

970
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:53,096
What does fucking rule says?

971
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:55,398
Maybe you think that you're

972
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:56,799
getting disease from me.

973
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,900
Yeah? That is it, maybe?

974
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,068
That's why you guys are

975
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,703
always wearing your rubber

976
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:01,938
gloves.

977
00:54:01,939 --> 00:54:02,739
You guys don't even like to

978
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,406
touch us.

979
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,907
You don't...

980
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,142
hey, calm down.

981
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:08,377
I didn't say that.

982
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:08,878
No. You know, you... let me

983
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:11,647
tell you.

984
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:12,148
You figured it out all, you

985
00:54:12,149 --> 00:54:14,951
know?

986
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:16,085
This was a secret message.

987
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,121
Look at this.

988
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:19,922
I was going to send this to all

989
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,658
my al-qaedas friends in

990
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:23,092
new york, and this was my big

991
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,393
escape plan.

992
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,434
Don't... don't do that.

993
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:30,166
Gone. See? Whhht!

994
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:32,034
It's now in their hands, okay?

995
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:32,602
I was trying to be nice with

996
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,537
you.

997
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:35,071
I-I-I wasn't being asshole to

998
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:36,639
you.

999
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,607
I don't know why you are being

1000
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,142
asshole to me.

1001
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:39,509
I am not being an asshole to

1002
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:39,842
you.

1003
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:40,910
I...

1004
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:41,677
I think you... yes, yes, yes,

1005
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:42,378
you are.

1006
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:44,380
Yes.

1007
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:44,993
Fuck you!

1008
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,592
You locked up us here for years!

1009
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:58,027
For what?!

1010
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:01,798
To show the world that you are

1011
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,199
good guy and we are bad guy?!

1012
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,203
Fuck you!

1013
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:08,538
You and america are the bad guy!

1014
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:09,005
You american are the real

1015
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,340
terrorists!

1016
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:19,341
Hey, keep it down!

1017
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:43,906
I looked for your book, you

1018
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:47,210
know?

1019
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:49,512
Your <i>harry potter</i> book...

1020
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:52,915
it's not in the library.

1021
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,517
You're fooling with me, huh?

1022
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,519
No.

1023
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:04,520
No, it's really not there.

1024
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:12,735
You're sure it's not there?

1025
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:15,238
Huh?

1026
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:17,874
Are you sure the book is not

1027
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,275
there 'cause, you know, once,

1028
00:56:19,276 --> 00:56:20,877
one of these guards... he told

1029
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,278
me that he has seen it in the

1030
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:24,180
library.

1031
00:56:24,181 --> 00:56:25,281
You know... you know, he...

1032
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:26,749
he... he... he was... keep

1033
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,050
telling me each week that,

1034
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,252
"I will bring it next week.

1035
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:31,254
I will bring it next week," but

1036
00:56:31,255 --> 00:56:32,488
he never bring it for me.

1037
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,489
He's probably fucking with

1038
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,491
you.

1039
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:43,492
It's not there.

1040
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:16,299
I'm sorry for... Asking you

1041
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,669
too much about these books.

1042
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,103
You know, it... it's been a very

1043
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,606
long time that I have been

1044
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,876
waiting.

1045
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:31,981
And sometimes, I think that it's

1046
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:35,885
making me crazy... A little,

1047
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:38,888
you know?

1048
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:43,592
Not knowing how all these things

1049
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:45,361
are going to end.

1050
00:57:45,362 --> 00:57:47,663
It's been a long time that I'm

1051
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:49,865
waiting.

1052
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:52,134
For the book?

1053
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,639
Yeah.

1054
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,844
Yeah, for the book.

1055
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:05,247
You understand what I am saying?

1056
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:07,550
I can... I can imagine what

1057
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:09,652
it would be like.

1058
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:17,626
Can you?

1059
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:23,265
Mm. I... Try to.

1060
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:29,538
Then... I will also try.

1061
01:00:13,844 --> 01:00:15,377
Hey, 3-6-1...

1062
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:18,314
Chicken piccata is really good

1063
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:20,449
today... better than normal.

1064
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,402
You want some?

1065
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:37,433
Come on. No takers?

1066
01:00:39,703 --> 01:00:45,541
Come on, please?

1067
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:57,686
Well, that makes this day five.

1068
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:01,123
You all know what's coming next.

1069
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,362
You want to call it off?

1070
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:18,274
I'll take that as a "no."

1071
01:01:31,488 --> 01:01:33,556
Mmm. Butter pecan.

1072
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:35,791
Bon appétit.

1073
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:47,870
How long are we gonna keep

1074
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:49,838
doing this?

1075
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:53,209
As long as they can.

1076
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,247
Attention on deck.

1077
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,183
That's the ringleader?

1078
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:03,485
Yes, sir.

1079
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,854
What's he want this time?

1080
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,890
Uh, I'm not sure, sir.

1081
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,158
Sir.

1082
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:10,192
Yes?

1083
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,894
I think I heard him say

1084
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,096
something about an elliptical

1085
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:14,981
machine, sir.

1086
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:36,619
You think they're gonna give

1087
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,920
him one?

1088
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,355
Why not?

1089
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:40,623
It would be easier than this.

1090
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:42,391
Yeah, but it'd take forever

1091
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:44,360
to get down here.

1092
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,362
Are you kidding me?

1093
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:54,363
They'll just take ours.

1094
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:07,583
Who's winning?

1095
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:13,122
You guys... that's who.

1096
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:16,692
I don't know about that.

1097
01:03:16,693 --> 01:03:20,963
You got your elliptical machine.

1098
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:22,331
Yeah.

1099
01:03:22,332 --> 01:03:25,267
You gonna use it?

1100
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:29,171
No.

1101
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:31,607
No one will use it.

1102
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:33,309
Why'd you demand it?

1103
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,312
<i>I</i> didn't demand this...

1104
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,681
mahmoud did.

1105
01:03:38,682 --> 01:03:39,948
Why'd he demand it?

1106
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:40,649
I don't know.

1107
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,086
Go ask mahmoud.

1108
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:49,591
Maybe because he's an asshole?

1109
01:04:01,104 --> 01:04:03,972
So what's the count today?

1110
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:05,574
Oh. I've only gotten to

1111
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,210
12 kicks today.

1112
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,045
Do you know what I hear today?

1113
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:13,115
Well, someone says sabir in

1114
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:14,183
"a" block... they said he hit

1115
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:14,717
40 last week.

1116
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:16,618
40?

1117
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:17,286
Yeah. That's what they say.

1118
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:19,154
I don't know.

1119
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:20,723
I'm not so sure 'cause, well, no

1120
01:04:20,724 --> 01:04:22,725
one has seen this, you know...

1121
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:25,127
only the guards, and those

1122
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:27,396
guards... they wouldn't say.

1123
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:30,766
You think you can beat 40?

1124
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:32,601
I don't know.

1125
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:35,070
I still think that he's made

1126
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,606
this up, you know.

1127
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:45,614
I tell you what... you beat

1128
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,116
40, I'll vouch for you.

1129
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:49,084
Yeah?

1130
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:52,087
Yeah.

1131
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:55,758
Okay.

1132
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:58,193
2...3...4...5...

1133
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:02,464
6...7...8...

1134
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,667
You're a long way away from

1135
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:06,702
40.

1136
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:07,569
What was that?

1137
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,071
8.

1138
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,606
Are you sure?

1139
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:11,774
Wasn't that 48?

1140
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:12,674
I'm sure.

1141
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:13,709
You saw 48.

1142
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:14,243
I didn't.

1143
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:16,779
I mean, come on.

1144
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,414
Those guys... they don't believe

1145
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,083
you, anyway.

1146
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,519
Not gonna lie for you.

1147
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:32,594
You know, compliant detainees

1148
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,629
get to play on a real field

1149
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:36,665
together?

1150
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,267
Uh-huh. They are lucky.

1151
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:41,737
If you stop acting up,

1152
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:42,805
they'll transfer you.

1153
01:05:42,806 --> 01:05:44,973
You know that, right?

1154
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:48,811
Mm-hmm.

1155
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:54,049
And you don't care?

1156
01:05:55,852 --> 01:05:57,453
It's those guys who don't

1157
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:58,687
care, blondie.

1158
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:00,322
You know, they don't care about

1159
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:02,691
anything, just the things that

1160
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,860
make their life easier.

1161
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:06,595
You guys always say, "follow

1162
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:09,064
these rules... we will let you

1163
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:10,833
watch tv," huh?

1164
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:12,401
But if I follow your rules, what

1165
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:13,569
does it means?

1166
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:14,670
It means that I'm agreeing that

1167
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:15,838
you have the right to give me

1168
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:16,839
rules, huh?

1169
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,707
Well, you don't.

1170
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,709
You don't have the right to give

1171
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,645
me rules.

1172
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:28,784
So, me... I never agree to

1173
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:30,619
follow your rules... never.

1174
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,120
You know, maybe you think I'm

1175
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:32,821
stupid for this.

1176
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,156
No, you're not stupid.

1177
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:36,158
No. I mean, maybe you're

1178
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:42,498
right, but...

1179
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:49,538
You're definitely not stupid.

1180
01:06:49,539 --> 01:06:51,773
You went to university.

1181
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:53,054
You're making fun of me, huh?

1182
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,878
Yeah, you're making fun...

1183
01:06:55,879 --> 01:06:56,912
you're laughing at me, huh?

1184
01:06:56,913 --> 01:06:58,180
Come on. Look at you.

1185
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:00,182
You're laughing at me, huh?

1186
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,895
What's that about?

1187
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:14,296
Nothing.

1188
01:07:14,297 --> 01:07:15,931
They don't like you talking

1189
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:17,332
to me, huh?

1190
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:21,937
Private...

1191
01:07:21,938 --> 01:07:24,106
Get over here.

1192
01:07:24,107 --> 01:07:28,377
Neither do they, huh?

1193
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:32,714
Yes, corporal?

1194
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,450
What were you just talking

1195
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:36,385
about over there?

1196
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:36,998
With ali?

1197
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:42,491
No, with detainee 471.

1198
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:43,792
Nothing.

1199
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:45,227
Uh-huh. All right.

1200
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:46,261
Well, if you ain't talking about

1201
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,964
nothing, then you don't need to

1202
01:07:48,965 --> 01:07:50,432
be talking, right?

1203
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:51,833
Hey!

1204
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:54,236
Hey, I did 20 kicks!

1205
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:55,737
Hey! I did 20 kicks!

1206
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,173
Did you see that, blondie?

1207
01:07:58,174 --> 01:08:00,709
I swear I did 20!

1208
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:02,210
I swear I did!

1209
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:03,745
I'm gonna need your help on

1210
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,948
the showers today.

1211
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:08,283
The showers?

1212
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:09,418
I know you don't want to, but

1213
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:10,652
all my extra men are dealing

1214
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:11,787
with some dickhead in delta pod

1215
01:08:11,788 --> 01:08:13,889
that decided to cover his

1216
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:14,723
entire cell in poop.

1217
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:15,724
I can't work showers.

1218
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:15,991
They won't even look me in the

1219
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:17,225
eye.

1220
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:18,894
They think they're gonna shower?

1221
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:19,995
Well, that's their problem.

1222
01:08:19,996 --> 01:08:23,365
I mean, at least it'll speed

1223
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:25,300
things up.

1224
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:25,634
S.O.P. Clearly states we are

1225
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:28,670
not...

1226
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:29,605
I know what s.O.P. Says.

1227
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,873
What's the matter?

1228
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:33,008
Can't handle it?

1229
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:34,676
You want me to get one of my

1230
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:35,744
other guys, pull him away from

1231
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:37,779
doing whatever the hell he's

1232
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:42,017
doing, so he can do it for you?

1233
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:46,822
No.

1234
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,599
Forget her.

1235
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,601
Get your ass in there.

1236
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:03,872
Let's go, skippy.

1237
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:05,874
Get undressed.

1238
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:11,947
Clock's ticking.

1239
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:21,950
Get your pants off.

1240
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:29,598
And shorts off.

1241
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:33,502
Come on.

1242
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:35,270
Get your fucking shorts off.

1243
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:36,271
Get your fucking shorts off, or

1244
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:37,372
I'll call in an irf and we'll

1245
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,374
get them to take them off for

1246
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,410
you.

1247
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:42,295
Get them off.

1248
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:06,535
You guarding the fence, or you

1249
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:07,869
guarding him?

1250
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,105
This is completely out of

1251
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:11,807
line.

1252
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:13,575
Let me ask you something...

1253
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:14,309
are you a soldier, or are you a

1254
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,110
female soldier?

1255
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:17,079
'Cause I don't have these kind

1256
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,447
of problems with soldiers.

1257
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:19,681
You got to watch him.

1258
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,683
That's your job.

1259
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:29,707
Look at him.

1260
01:10:58,554 --> 01:10:59,554
Hey, cole, I thought that was

1261
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:00,922
you.

1262
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,023
What are you doing back here?

1263
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:02,991
Drinking.

1264
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,026
No shit.

1265
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:09,397
What's wrong?

1266
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:11,433
You had a bad day or something?

1267
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:12,768
Not particularly.

1268
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:19,875
Not as bad as yours, I hear.

1269
01:11:19,876 --> 01:11:22,077
What do you mean?

1270
01:11:22,078 --> 01:11:25,380
I heard some detainee just

1271
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:27,149
covered his cell on feces.

1272
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:28,650
Probably wasn't fun.

1273
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,452
When... today?

1274
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:31,653
On delta pod?

1275
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:32,154
No, it was just pretty quiet all

1276
01:11:32,155 --> 01:11:34,089
day.

1277
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:37,058
Yeah.

1278
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:39,427
Must have been another pod.

1279
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:40,529
No, nothing like that

1280
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:44,199
happened on any of the pods.

1281
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,467
If it did, I would've saw it.

1282
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:46,067
Come in, boys!

1283
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:46,935
It's shot time!

1284
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:47,469
That's what I'm talking

1285
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:51,006
about!

1286
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:53,708
Oh, hey.

1287
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,644
What do you want?

1288
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:58,413
Jackie chan got one.

1289
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,834
Shh! Shh!

1290
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:25,841
I'm not following you here.

1291
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:06,548
[ Soldiers shouting cadences

1292
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:07,433

At ease.

1296
01:13:25,034 --> 01:13:33,034
Have a seat, private.

1297
01:13:38,314 --> 01:13:40,582
Candy?

1298
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:43,985
No, thank you, sir.

1299
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:46,621
I've read your report.

1300
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:48,623
I've also spoken to

1301
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:56,624
corporal ransdell.

1302
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,570
In your report, you say that you

1303
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:03,772
were escorting a detainee to the

1304
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,006
showers after rec... is that

1305
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:06,608
correct?

1306
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:07,676
Affirmative.

1307
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:10,879
And you filed the report

1308
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,316
because this was uncomfortable.

1309
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:16,084
Well... No, I-it made him

1310
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:17,319
uncomfortable.

1311
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,121
Who?

1312
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,923
The detainee.

1313
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:24,626
So you filed against a fellow

1314
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:27,829
soldier because the detainee

1315
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,264
was uncomfortable?

1316
01:14:29,265 --> 01:14:32,067
It was not the proper way to

1317
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:33,335
treat him, sir.

1318
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:35,270
Did the detainee take a

1319
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:36,771
shower?

1320
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:37,872
Yes, sir.

1321
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:42,577
Sounds like he wasn't that

1322
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:44,012
uncomfortable with it, then.

1323
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:45,780
It was a blatant violation of

1324
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:47,649
standard operating procedure,

1325
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,616
which is why I filed the report.

1326
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:50,652
Since you knew what was

1327
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,020
happening was against s.O.P.,

1328
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:53,888
what exactly were you doing

1329
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:55,256
there?

1330
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:56,624
I was ordered to be there,

1331
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:58,360
sir.

1332
01:14:58,361 --> 01:15:00,662
Corporal ransdell gave you a

1333
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,397
direct order?

1334
01:15:02,398 --> 01:15:03,665
He had lied about being

1335
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,133
shorthanded.

1336
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:06,301
Did he order you, or did he

1337
01:15:06,302 --> 01:15:07,068
lie to you?

1338
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:08,203
Sir...

1339
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:09,337
'cause it seems to me there'd

1340
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,605
be no point to lie to you if he

1341
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:12,207
simply ordered you.

1342
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:16,378
He... he...

1343
01:15:16,379 --> 01:15:17,746
and there's nothing going on?

1344
01:15:17,747 --> 01:15:21,316
You don't have a personal

1345
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:25,987
relationship with him, nothing

1346
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:28,390
going on outside the wire?

1347
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:30,558
No, sir.

1348
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:35,163
Is that what he told you?

1349
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:43,071
4-7-1, the detainee...

1350
01:15:43,072 --> 01:15:44,973
you two are friends.

1351
01:15:44,974 --> 01:15:48,877
No, sir.

1352
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:49,677
You're not friendly with him?

1353
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:50,222
No, sir.

1354
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:56,284
You don't talk to him?

1355
01:15:56,285 --> 01:16:01,156
We have spoken.

1356
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:04,459
I am... Not...

1357
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:05,794
I...

1358
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:07,862
Like I said in my report...

1359
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:09,130
I've read your report.

1360
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:09,964
I know what it says.

1361
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:11,466
I also know what

1362
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:12,867
corporal ransdell says about it.

1363
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:14,202
But what I don't know and will

1364
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:16,137
probably never know is what is

1365
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:21,076
really going on here.

1366
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,214
Do you like it here, son?

1367
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:28,249
Sir?

1368
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:33,721
Do you like it here...

1369
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:35,190
In guantánamo bay?

1370
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:36,891
Yes, sir.

1371
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:39,227
It's fine.

1372
01:16:39,228 --> 01:16:40,462
I hate it.

1373
01:16:40,463 --> 01:16:43,731
This ain't the kind of post a

1374
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:44,866
guy makes his stars on.

1375
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:46,334
Nobody gives you a medal when

1376
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:47,702
you do it right... they just

1377
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:49,938
give you a demotion when you do

1378
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:52,507
it wrong.

1379
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:54,843
My granddad... he flew

1380
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:57,145
25 missions over germany, blew

1381
01:16:57,146 --> 01:16:59,347
up a dozen nazi installments.

1382
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:00,815
What do we get?

1383
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:04,385
We get to babysit a bunch of

1384
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:06,788
sheep farmers.

1385
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:07,489
Like I said, I hate it here,

1386
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:11,226
and, yet, here I am.

1387
01:17:11,227 --> 01:17:12,994
And do you know why?

1388
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:15,663
I'm here because my commanding

1389
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:20,969
officer told me to come here.

1390
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:26,207
Yes, sir.

1391
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,009
The review board will have,

1392
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:31,779
uh, a hearing for both of you

1393
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:32,313
next month.

1394
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,415
I didn't do...

1395
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:37,785
you're dismissed.

1396
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:41,022
Yes, sir.

1397
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:44,425
Good morning, sir.

1398
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,128
Hey.

1399
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:50,398
Hey.

1400
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:55,003
How's your enchilada?

1401
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:56,804
It's about as good as it

1402
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:57,539
looks.

1403
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,773
I should have went with the

1404
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:00,475
chicken fingers.

1405
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:02,010
Hard to mess those up, right?

1406
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:12,220
Hear about what happened on

1407
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:13,521
delta pod?

1408
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:14,355
What?

1409
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,037
Another cocktail?

1410
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:19,027
No. A dude tried to hang

1411
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,562
himself last night.

1412
01:18:20,563 --> 01:18:21,829
How?

1413
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,299
It's not even possible.

1414
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,334
We watch these guys 24-7.

1415
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:29,437
No, not a detainee.

1416
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:33,074
It was a... it was a guard.

1417
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:36,477
The dude tied himself off to a

1418
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:37,812
ceiling fan and... get this...

1419
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:38,213
the piece of shit pulled out of

1420
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:38,913
the wall.

1421
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:42,917
Can you believe that shit?

1422
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:44,852
The dude's life got saved by

1423
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:45,813
shitty army contractors.

1424
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:50,225
It's funny, right?

1425
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:51,993
He's lucky.

1426
01:18:51,994 --> 01:18:54,162
It's crazy though, right...

1427
01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:54,829
that he tried to kill himself?

1428
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:55,997
I mean, I get it.

1429
01:18:55,998 --> 01:18:57,498
It's a tough mission, you know.

1430
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:58,399
But what the fuck, man?

1431
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,534
It's our fucking job.

1432
01:18:59,535 --> 01:19:00,902
You got to get over it, you

1433
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:01,403
know?

1434
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:06,908
Yeah.

1435
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,076
I know.

1436
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:08,610
It's got to be hard for some

1437
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:11,379
people, though.

1438
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:12,146
It's...

1439
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,584
It's not as black and white as

1440
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:19,554
they said it was gonna be.

1441
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:21,022
What's that mean?

1442
01:19:21,023 --> 01:19:22,190
I don't know what he was

1443
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,258
expecting, but I'm sure it

1444
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:24,092
wasn't this.

1445
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,261
Come on, though.

1446
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:27,362
It's not as bad as that.

1447
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:28,863
A lot of these guys aren't even

1448
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:30,331
that tough.

1449
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:31,666
Exactly.

1450
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:32,300
Makes you feel fucking guilty.

1451
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:33,368
It's like...

1452
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:34,402
Guilty? Come... what the fuck

1453
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:34,969
you got to feel guilty for?

1454
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,170
No, man.

1455
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:36,871
Hell, you shouldn't feel guilty

1456
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:39,073
about shit.

1457
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:40,174
These motherfuckers did 9/11,

1458
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:41,042
and now they're in jail...

1459
01:19:41,043 --> 01:19:42,277
end of story.

1460
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:46,447
The motherfuckers that did

1461
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:47,649
9/11 died there.

1462
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:48,883
You know what your problem

1463
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:49,984
is?

1464
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:50,985
You've been talking too much to

1465
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:52,253
the fucking translators.

1466
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:53,454
They've gotten all in your head,

1467
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:54,922
and you've forgotten how lucky

1468
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:56,924
you really are.

1469
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,626
We could be in iraq right now.

1470
01:19:58,627 --> 01:19:59,927
You realize that?

1471
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:02,063
I mean, you'd rather be dodging

1472
01:20:02,064 --> 01:20:05,199
cocktails than bullets, right?

1473
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,305
No.

1474
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:12,440
Whatever.

1475
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:14,509
10 minutes, faggots.

1476
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:20,014
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

1477
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:27,088
Hey... You smoke now?

1478
01:20:27,089 --> 01:20:27,633
Yeah.

1479
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:41,069
What are you gonna do, cole?

1480
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:47,041
Tell on it?

1481
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:42,397
Based on the detainees'

1482
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:44,599
preferences...

1483
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:10,651
Yo.

1484
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,153
What's up?

1485
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,154
Here you go.

1486
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:17,792
You've been transferred.

1487
01:23:17,793 --> 01:23:21,162
What? Where?

1488
01:23:22,698 --> 01:23:23,564
Night shift.

1489
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:25,266
Yeah.

1490
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:26,734
Just, uh, skip tomorrow.

1491
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:27,835
Rotate in on the next.

1492
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:28,236
Your new o.I.C. Will come get

1493
01:23:28,237 --> 01:23:30,104
you.

1494
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:31,105
It's all there.

1495
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:32,540
Why?

1496
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:33,107
Why?

1497
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:34,242
Shit, cole.

1498
01:23:34,243 --> 01:23:36,244
You know ain't no why in the

1499
01:23:36,245 --> 01:23:36,745
army.

1500
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:07,575
Hey. Hey.

1501
01:24:07,576 --> 01:24:10,278
Is that clock right?

1502
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:10,823
Yeah.

1503
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,584
So... W-where is blondie?

1504
01:24:16,585 --> 01:24:18,586
Huh?

1505
01:24:38,874 --> 01:24:40,508
Detainee 1-0-8 was heard

1506
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:41,676
singing a song in arabic that

1507
01:24:41,677 --> 01:24:43,477
had the english words

1508
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:45,980
"bin laden" in it.

1509
01:24:45,981 --> 01:24:47,782
At 1700 hours, detainee 9-1

1510
01:24:47,783 --> 01:24:48,816
complained that his chow smelled

1511
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:50,318
rotten.

1512
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:51,719
He was given another meal, which

1513
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,187
he said tasted bad.

1514
01:24:55,691 --> 01:24:57,191
At 1900, detainee 2-3-5 was

1515
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:59,560
given a water bottle.

1516
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:01,195
He drank it, asked for another,

1517
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:02,530
and proceeded to drink six more

1518
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:03,631
bottles in the span of five

1519
01:25:03,632 --> 01:25:04,999
minutes.

1520
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,435
He then complained of feeling

1521
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:09,971
bad.

1522
01:25:09,972 --> 01:25:13,541
We had 2-5 moves scheduled,

1523
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:16,510
2-8 moves completed.

1524
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:17,545
Atten-hut!

1525
01:25:17,546 --> 01:25:19,614
Honor bound.

1526
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:27,615
To defend freedom.

1527
01:25:57,786 --> 01:26:00,921
Blondie?

1528
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:04,859
Blondie?

1529
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,527
It is you.

1530
01:26:06,528 --> 01:26:08,329
Hey, don't... don't get up.

1531
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,330
Go back to sleep.

1532
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:12,500
No. No. No.

1533
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,468
I-I-I-I can never sleep well...

1534
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:15,736
you know, here, anyway.

1535
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:16,971
I didn't... I didn't know

1536
01:26:16,972 --> 01:26:17,905
they kept the lights on all

1537
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:20,641
night.

1538
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:23,044
All day and all night.

1539
01:26:23,045 --> 01:26:25,613
How is it that you're here?

1540
01:26:25,614 --> 01:26:28,282
I mean, uh, you're a night

1541
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:28,783
guard.

1542
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,087
Oh. Um, I'm sorry.

1543
01:26:33,088 --> 01:26:34,622
You cannot say.

1544
01:26:34,623 --> 01:26:40,061
I-it's okay.

1545
01:26:40,062 --> 01:26:40,942
No. Actually, uh...

1546
01:26:42,431 --> 01:26:43,831
I snitched on someone.

1547
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:45,099
What... what... what is it...

1548
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:47,835
snitch?

1549
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:49,937
It's like golden snitch and...

1550
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:53,074
No.

1551
01:26:53,075 --> 01:26:57,645
Um, to snitch on someone is,

1552
01:26:57,646 --> 01:26:59,346
uh... It's to tell... like,

1553
01:26:59,347 --> 01:27:04,351
if someone does something wrong,

1554
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:06,353
you turn them in.

1555
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:10,725
Who... who did you snitch on?

1556
01:27:13,028 --> 01:27:17,698
I can't say.

1557
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:20,334
It's moptop, huh?

1558
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:23,637
What... what did he do to you?

1559
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:28,042
You should get some sleep.

1560
01:27:28,043 --> 01:27:28,995
See you later.

1561
01:27:50,532 --> 01:27:51,098
I'm not gonna tell you what he

1562
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,700
did.

1563
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:59,607
Okay.

1564
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:02,777
So, tell me this one... how did

1565
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:04,145
you end up here?

1566
01:28:04,146 --> 01:28:05,012
I told you... they reassigned

1567
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:06,447
me.

1568
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:08,682
No, no.

1569
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:10,684
How did you end up here in this

1570
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:11,185
place?

1571
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:20,928
How did you end up here?

1572
01:28:20,929 --> 01:28:23,464
Me?

1573
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:28,035
How did I end up here?

1574
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:34,475
I could tell you that I was not

1575
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:36,610
with al-qaeda or a terrorist

1576
01:28:36,611 --> 01:28:37,878
or... you wouldn't believe me,

1577
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:40,548
anyway.

1578
01:28:40,549 --> 01:28:46,187
Nobody believes me here.

1579
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:52,059
So you're from germany?

1580
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:54,428
Yeah.

1581
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:55,129
You remember.

1582
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:58,999
Yeah.

1583
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,434
Yeah. Yeah.

1584
01:29:00,435 --> 01:29:03,704
From germany, yeah.

1585
01:29:03,705 --> 01:29:04,805
Actually, I was, you know, from

1586
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:06,740
bremen.

1587
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:08,742
Do you know the city... bremen?

1588
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:09,610
Bremen?

1589
01:29:09,611 --> 01:29:11,545
You don't know?

1590
01:29:11,546 --> 01:29:12,627
No. I can't even say it.

1591
01:29:15,817 --> 01:29:16,784
Huh? <i>Sprechen sie deutsch?</i>

1592
01:29:16,785 --> 01:29:17,918
No speak <i>deutsch?</i>

1593
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:18,919
Mm, dutch?

1594
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,154
What?

1595
01:29:20,155 --> 01:29:21,922
<i>Nein.</i>

1596
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:24,458
Um, no.

1597
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:26,894
Have you been in germany

1598
01:29:26,895 --> 01:29:27,828
before?

1599
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:28,596
No?

1600
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:29,597
No.

1601
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:30,098
No.

1602
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:35,803
No. I'd like to... plan to.

1603
01:29:35,804 --> 01:29:37,805
So, tell me... where have you

1604
01:29:37,806 --> 01:29:40,941
been?

1605
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:45,279
I mean, you're...

1606
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,281
you're probably gonna laugh.

1607
01:29:47,282 --> 01:29:48,983
Me? Laugh? No.

1608
01:29:48,984 --> 01:29:52,786
At you?

1609
01:29:52,787 --> 01:29:55,489
Uh, I-I never laugh at you.

1610
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:59,059
This is my first time out of the

1611
01:29:59,060 --> 01:29:59,727
country... I mean, it's pretty

1612
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:01,896
lame, right?

1613
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:02,763
No.

1614
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:06,200
No, it's not.

1615
01:30:06,201 --> 01:30:07,568
It's... you're... you're young.

1616
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:08,802
You're very young, and

1617
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:10,271
you're... you're a beginner,

1618
01:30:10,272 --> 01:30:13,040
huh?

1619
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:14,275
Yeah.

1620
01:30:14,276 --> 01:30:16,977
There are more people on this

1621
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:18,312
base than in my hometown.

1622
01:30:18,313 --> 01:30:20,714
Small, huh?

1623
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:22,549
Yeah, tiny... gets smaller

1624
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:25,019
every day.

1625
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,587
And is this the reason that

1626
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:29,890
you came here?

1627
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:33,761
Part of it, yeah.

1628
01:30:33,762 --> 01:30:34,995
What is the other part?

1629
01:30:34,996 --> 01:30:37,298
A lot of reasons.

1630
01:30:37,299 --> 01:30:39,466
Um.

1631
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:50,644
I wanted to do something.

1632
01:30:50,645 --> 01:30:51,946
You know, I...

1633
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:54,048
I wanted to do something

1634
01:30:54,049 --> 01:30:58,118
important.

1635
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:00,665
Yeah.

1636
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:07,645
I understand.

1637
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:04,685
Hey.

1638
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:10,157
Thank you.

1639
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:11,425
It's hard making the switch,

1640
01:32:11,426 --> 01:32:13,093
huh?

1641
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:16,397
Yeah, it's all right.

1642
01:32:16,398 --> 01:32:17,765
It takes a few days.

1643
01:32:17,766 --> 01:32:20,000
Of course, uh, you won't be a

1644
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:21,702
night owl for... for too long,

1645
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:23,704
right?

1646
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:27,174
I guess not.

1647
01:32:27,175 --> 01:32:29,443
Or...

1648
01:32:29,444 --> 01:32:30,711
I hated the day shift...

1649
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:34,348
bunch of detainees chatting your

1650
01:32:34,349 --> 01:32:36,350
ear off.

1651
01:32:36,351 --> 01:32:42,756
I'd hate that.

1652
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:48,829
Thanks for the coffee.

1653
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:04,878
Hey. Are you still awake?

1654
01:33:08,283 --> 01:33:10,784
What day is today?

1655
01:33:10,785 --> 01:33:13,887
Wednesday.

1656
01:33:13,888 --> 01:33:16,323
No, what date is today?

1657
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:20,894
Um, july 14th.

1658
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:28,135
So you're leaving next month?

1659
01:33:28,136 --> 01:33:30,370
Yeah.

1660
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:32,473
How'd you know that?

1661
01:33:32,474 --> 01:33:34,708
They always change the guards

1662
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:35,389
in august.

1663
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:48,822
So, when... when you leave, will

1664
01:33:48,823 --> 01:33:50,724
you sign up again here?

1665
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:52,459
Like, you know, there are guards

1666
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:56,330
here that have been for many

1667
01:33:56,331 --> 01:33:58,999
years.

1668
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:07,000
No, I don't think so.

1669
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:13,981
So you want to go to your

1670
01:34:13,982 --> 01:34:16,049
home, your... your small town?

1671
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:20,020
No.

1672
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:26,760
What do you want to do, then?

1673
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:32,232
I don't know yet.

1674
01:34:32,233 --> 01:34:34,468
Travel, maybe.

1675
01:34:34,469 --> 01:34:37,538
Go to bremen.

1676
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:43,911
I don't like this month.

1677
01:34:48,383 --> 01:34:51,919
Always these new guards...

1678
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:55,989
Treating us like very bad guys.

1679
01:34:59,494 --> 01:35:04,932
They'll learn... Like I did.

1680
01:35:07,168 --> 01:35:13,440
What did you learn?

1681
01:35:15,977 --> 01:35:16,477
Huh?

1682
01:35:20,582 --> 01:35:22,049
Tell me.

1683
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:25,018
You must learn something, huh,

1684
01:35:25,019 --> 01:35:28,021
when I throw that shit on you...

1685
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:30,357
you learned something, huh?

1686
01:35:30,358 --> 01:35:33,060
Or when we're trying to kill

1687
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:34,928
ourselves here, with hunger

1688
01:35:34,929 --> 01:35:35,596
strike, you learned something...

1689
01:35:35,597 --> 01:35:37,364
huh?... You said.

1690
01:35:37,365 --> 01:35:38,332
So tell me... what is that?

1691
01:35:38,333 --> 01:35:40,467
I want to know.

1692
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:46,373
What did you learn?

1693
01:35:49,043 --> 01:35:51,478
Only you think you know, but you

1694
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:56,316
know nothing.

1695
01:35:56,317 --> 01:36:02,656
You know nothing about me.

1696
01:36:02,657 --> 01:36:07,894
You and me...

1697
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:11,932
We are at war.

1698
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:16,670
I don't see it like that.

1699
01:36:16,671 --> 01:36:18,972
Then you see nothing.

1700
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:26,173
What is that?

1701
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:27,274
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1702
01:37:27,275 --> 01:37:28,475
If... if you call on your

1703
01:37:28,476 --> 01:37:30,510
radio, you're not going to make

1704
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:33,513
it.

1705
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:36,316
You're not going to make it.

1706
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:39,252
Bring it down.

1707
01:37:39,253 --> 01:37:44,057
Bring it down.

1708
01:37:44,058 --> 01:37:47,160
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1709
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:48,395
Okay.

1710
01:37:48,396 --> 01:37:49,563
Just don't do anything crazy,

1711
01:37:49,564 --> 01:37:50,731
okay?

1712
01:37:50,732 --> 01:37:53,734
You think I'm crazy?

1713
01:37:53,735 --> 01:37:56,069
No. No, I said just don't...

1714
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,404
don't do anything crazy.

1715
01:37:57,405 --> 01:37:58,638

1716
01:37:58,639 --> 01:37:59,439
If you was me, you wouldn't do

1717
01:37:59,440 --> 01:37:59,940
this?

1718
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:05,011
Give me one reason why... one.

1719
01:38:05,012 --> 01:38:07,114
Maybe to try to not... not

1720
01:38:07,115 --> 01:38:09,516
die in this... this fucking

1721
01:38:09,517 --> 01:38:12,285
shithole.

1722
01:38:12,286 --> 01:38:13,487
I don't like to die in this

1723
01:38:13,488 --> 01:38:15,122
shithole!

1724
01:38:15,123 --> 01:38:16,590
But one way or another, this is

1725
01:38:16,591 --> 01:38:17,657
the place I will die.

1726
01:38:20,428 --> 01:38:24,030
Look, you don't know that.

1727
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:28,301
You can't know that.

1728
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:29,503
Ali, things can change.

1729
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,036
Things... things can always

1730
01:38:30,037 --> 01:38:32,806
change.

1731
01:38:32,807 --> 01:38:34,107
You... you can't just, uh...

1732
01:38:34,108 --> 01:38:34,608
you can't just fucking give up.

1733
01:38:34,609 --> 01:38:36,009
You got to...

1734
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:37,611
give up, blondie... what is

1735
01:38:37,612 --> 01:38:39,146
"give up"?

1736
01:38:39,147 --> 01:38:41,047
Three years ago, they took me to

1737
01:38:41,048 --> 01:38:42,549
these interrogations.

1738
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:44,084
And one of your guys here, one

1739
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:45,752
of those guys who don't wear

1740
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:46,386
uniform... he told me that I'm

1741
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:47,654
innocent.

1742
01:38:47,655 --> 01:38:49,256
He told me that he knows I'm

1743
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:50,757
innocent, but I still cannot go

1744
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:52,159
home...

1745
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,027
Because there's no country, no

1746
01:38:54,028 --> 01:38:56,563
city, no fucking person in this

1747
01:38:56,564 --> 01:38:57,664
planet will take me because I've

1748
01:38:57,665 --> 01:38:58,198
been here.

1749
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,467
I have no place to go,

1750
01:39:00,468 --> 01:39:03,069
blondie.

1751
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:05,772
This is the only thing that can

1752
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:08,041
change something.

1753
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:16,516
Everything okay?

1754
01:39:16,517 --> 01:39:17,017
Yeah.

1755
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:22,622
Yeah, everything's fine. Um.

1756
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:23,590
My... my radio's... it's...

1757
01:39:23,591 --> 01:39:25,192
it's on the fritz.

1758
01:39:25,193 --> 01:39:29,496
Can you get me another one?

1759
01:39:29,497 --> 01:39:30,430
Uh, yeah.

1760
01:39:46,113 --> 01:39:49,649
Blondie, you...

1761
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:50,410
you are a good guy.

1762
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:55,088
Yeah, thanks.

1763
01:39:55,089 --> 01:39:55,689
Am I a bad guy or a good guy

1764
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:59,259
to you?

1765
01:39:59,260 --> 01:39:59,793
Ali... It doesn't matter right

1766
01:39:59,794 --> 01:40:01,361
now.

1767
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:02,162
It's the only time it

1768
01:40:02,163 --> 01:40:04,865
matters.

1769
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:09,636
So you're gonna just...

1770
01:40:09,637 --> 01:40:10,704
you're gonna be a martyr?

1771
01:40:10,705 --> 01:40:11,605
Is that what you think you're...

1772
01:40:11,606 --> 01:40:12,506
you think you're gonna go to

1773
01:40:12,507 --> 01:40:13,007
heaven?

1774
01:40:16,644 --> 01:40:19,579
That's what you want to do?

1775
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:20,280
I don't believe in this

1776
01:40:20,281 --> 01:40:21,681
anymore.

1777
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:23,316
Well, then, why are you doing

1778
01:40:23,317 --> 01:40:25,318
this?

1779
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:27,521
Look at me.

1780
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:31,124
You're asking me why do I want

1781
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:33,727
to die, but you don't see that

1782
01:40:33,728 --> 01:40:36,196
I'm not even living.

1783
01:40:36,197 --> 01:40:39,733
You guys control everything.

1784
01:40:39,734 --> 01:40:40,600
You tell us what to eat, when to

1785
01:40:40,601 --> 01:40:43,403
sleep.

1786
01:40:43,404 --> 01:40:46,706
Even when we don't want to eat,

1787
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:49,209
you tell me we must.

1788
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:51,511
It is your life... it is not

1789
01:40:51,512 --> 01:40:54,414
ours.

1790
01:40:56,918 --> 01:41:00,887
I don't expect you to understand

1791
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:01,388
that.

1792
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,793
I-I like you.

1793
01:41:06,794 --> 01:41:09,796
I do.

1794
01:41:09,797 --> 01:41:11,798
But... but you'll never

1795
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:18,838

1796
01:41:20,841 --> 01:41:23,944
It's amy.

1797
01:41:25,346 --> 01:41:30,417
You keep calling me "blondie,"

1798
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:34,854
but... My name's amy cole from

1799
01:41:34,855 --> 01:41:37,390
moore haven, florida.

1800
01:41:37,391 --> 01:41:39,693
And I like you, ali.

1801
01:41:39,694 --> 01:41:40,510
I really do.

1802
01:41:56,811 --> 01:42:00,747
Ah, fuck!

1803
01:42:00,748 --> 01:42:02,882
Hey, hey!

1804
01:42:04,418 --> 01:42:09,656
Is there a... is there a zoo in

1805
01:42:09,657 --> 01:42:10,423
bremen?

1806
01:42:10,424 --> 01:42:13,960
What?

1807
01:42:15,329 --> 01:42:19,566
When I was a kid, I went to the

1808
01:42:19,567 --> 01:42:20,934
zoo with my dad.

1809
01:42:20,935 --> 01:42:23,837
It was just outside where we

1810
01:42:23,838 --> 01:42:26,306
lived and, uh... It's really

1811
01:42:26,307 --> 01:42:27,607
small, one of those zoos where

1812
01:42:27,608 --> 01:42:30,710
they keep the animals locked up

1813
01:42:30,711 --> 01:42:32,045
in these... these tiny, little

1814
01:42:32,046 --> 01:42:35,281
cages, these tiny, little, like,

1815
01:42:35,282 --> 01:42:36,316
concrete boxes with tires in

1816
01:42:36,317 --> 01:42:38,318
them or something.

1817
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:43,523
I was really excited about

1818
01:42:43,524 --> 01:42:46,626
going.

1819
01:42:46,627 --> 01:42:47,394
I really wanted to see something

1820
01:42:47,395 --> 01:42:50,397
outside my town.

1821
01:42:50,398 --> 01:42:51,731
I wanted to be...

1822
01:42:51,732 --> 01:42:54,200
I wanted to be so close to

1823
01:42:54,201 --> 01:42:58,371
something so wild and...

1824
01:43:00,041 --> 01:43:02,942
It just wasn't okay.

1825
01:43:02,943 --> 01:43:03,276
I didn't I didn't

1826
01:43:03,277 --> 01:43:04,310
like it.

1827
01:43:04,311 --> 01:43:05,412
And my dad kept trying to

1828
01:43:05,413 --> 01:43:09,082
fucking tell me that it was

1829
01:43:09,083 --> 01:43:10,483
okay, that... that this lion

1830
01:43:10,484 --> 01:43:13,887
could never go back home

1831
01:43:13,888 --> 01:43:15,055
because... because he wouldn't

1832
01:43:15,056 --> 01:43:16,322
be able to survive in the wild,

1833
01:43:16,323 --> 01:43:16,923
having been locked up for so

1834
01:43:16,924 --> 01:43:19,325
long.

1835
01:43:19,326 --> 01:43:20,627
Okay. You're trying to tell

1836
01:43:20,628 --> 01:43:22,729
me that the zoo people... they

1837
01:43:22,730 --> 01:43:24,731
are not guilty.

1838
01:43:24,732 --> 01:43:27,734
They have no choice.

1839
01:43:29,804 --> 01:43:30,304
No.

1840
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:40,046
I thought they had a choice.

1841
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:44,384
If they had the choice, they

1842
01:43:44,385 --> 01:43:45,452
should've given it to him.

1843
01:43:45,453 --> 01:43:47,454
They should have let the lion

1844
01:43:47,455 --> 01:43:47,955
choose.

1845
01:48:17,624 --> 01:48:18,858
You're the new guy, huh?

1846
01:48:18,859 --> 01:48:20,693
Tell me... how do you like it

1847
01:48:20,694 --> 01:48:24,163

1848
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:25,698
