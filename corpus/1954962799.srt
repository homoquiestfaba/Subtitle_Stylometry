1
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,577

Are we secure?


2
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,036
What is the situation?



3
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,124

My brother?




4

00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:45,002

You are in no position to ask me
questions Xing. You're the traitor!




5
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,839

This is everything about my
research in Elko




6

00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:51,883

And the US military?




7

00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,595

The Military has postponed the project...




8

00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,597

because of the accident.




9

00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,558

That's good news. Good news for Beijing.




10
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,770

So was it successful?




11

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,107

White Agent has infected everything
in the eight mile radius.




12

00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,943

Because the release was underground...



13

00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,655

It has leaked into all the areas major
water supplies, spreading miles.



14

00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,616

Is it airborne yet?




15

00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,035

No.




16

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,622

It failed.




17

00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,665

Well, I'm sure...




18

00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,667

That our teams here...




19

00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,711

Can improvise.




20

00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,590

You will not get anything
until I know my brother is safe!




21

00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,896

He has nothing to do with this!




22

00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:49,066

The longer this drags out...




23

00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,610

the less likely I can help his situation.




24

00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,612

You know...




25

00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,573

the state shoots traitors.




26

00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,622

Just send me what's on that drive...




27

00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,625

and this will all be over.




28

00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,710

You have...




29

00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,087

until tomorrow...




30

00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:12,673

three-O'clock...




31

00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,633

Beijing time.




32

00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,369

Your White Agent data?




33

00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,330

No...




34

00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,336

What? Excuse me?




35

00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,379

This weapon must not exist.




36

00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,381

Do you not care about your brother's life?




37

00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,342

Of course I do. But I cannot.




38

00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,345

How could you?...




39

00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,388

to your family?... your brother?




40

00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,016

I'll turn myself in. Just let him go!




41

00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,477

We don't want you!




42

00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,77
1
We want your data!




43

00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,731

Your brother will be executed!




44

00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,966

Don't worry Xing.




45

00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,552

I already forgive you.




46

00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,555

If we have a next life...




47

00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,598

I wish we can be...




48

00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,559

brothers again.




49

00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,646

I am very proud of you and...




50

00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,606

what you have done.




51

00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,526

Because...




52

00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:11,654

This is your destiny.
