         <i> accusation and</i>
     <i> hysterical rumor that</i>

3
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:11,470
     <i> this story took place.</i>

4
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:17,009
    <i> We were between fourteen</i>
     <i> and sixteen years old.</i>

5
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:21,847
         <i> We traveled in</i>
     <i> bands of five or six.</i>

6
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,983
         <i> We met in dark</i>
       <i> and secret places.</i>

7
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,925
 <i> We had taken a vow of silence.</i>

8
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:40,199
        <i> One of us was</i>
       <i> silenced forever.</i>

9
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,412
    <i> Most people remember the</i>
   <i> media frenzy that erupted</i>

10
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,447
          <i> in our town.</i>

11
00:01:55,449 --> 00:02:00,052
  <i> But few know the true secret</i>

       <i> Listen carefully.</i>

13
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,590
       <i> This is our story.</i>

14
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,199
 <i> It all started with one girl's</i>
    <i> decision to go offline.</i>

15
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,104
       <i> Mary Warren was a</i>
       <i> straight-C student</i>

16
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:22,307
      <i> who was voted, "Most</i>
   <i> Likely to Become Famous."</i>

17
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:29,214
 <i> Emily Parris was an only child</i>
 <i> with a blog that nobody read.</i>

18
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,350
    <i> She often prayed for new</i>
    <i> followers though most of</i>

19
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:34,653
       <i> the time she felt</i>
    <i> like a follower herself.</i>

20
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,787
Next.

21
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,956
Why don't each of
   you tell me what happened.

22
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,591
She ruined
          my audition!

23
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,460
Stinking pitch.

24
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:45,464
"Stinking pitch,
that the sea, mounting to the--

25
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,035
--the welkin's

26
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,070
...to the welkin's
          ass cheek--"

27
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,106
No! I mean
     "the welkin's cheek".

28
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,707
  Mr. Barry, can I start over?

29
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,343
Mary!? How would
     you like it if someone
    messed up your audition?

30
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,646
   Let's see what you can do.

31
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:10,489
"If by your art,
   my dearest father you have

     put the wild waters in
     this roar, allay them.

33
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,466
She stole my phone.

34
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,571
<i>Emily read</i>
   <i> Mary's texts, posted them</i>

35
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:30,008
  <i> on her blog and made Mary's</i>
   <i> life one big humiliation.</i>

36
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,814
Didn't you see what
Emily posted about Mary's mom?

37
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,217
Mrs. Warren's having an
 affair with some guy at work.

38
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,589
Did you see Emily's blog?

39
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:46,291
It's like Fatal Attraction
except nobody's died yet!

40
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,197
Everyone move back.

41
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:59,404
She called me a
     "blog war" in front of
       the whole school!

42
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,106
A blog what?

43
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,508
War!

44
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,079
Don't you mean "whore"?

45
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,748
       The "w" is silent

46
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,086
It is...

47
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:22,127
<i>Everyone was waiting</i>
 <i> for Mary to retaliate online.</i>

48
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:25,797
<i> But on that night, Mary's</i>
<i><i>     <i> Facebook status read:</i>

49
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,167
 <i> and she never logged in again.</i>

50
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:42,147
<i>Dear Diary. Or whatever</i>
    <i> you're supposed to say.</i>

51
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,716
   <i> I can't remember the last</i>
  <i> time I wrote something that</i>

52
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:48,153
     <i> wasn't on my computer.</i>

53
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,756
           <i> I love the</i>
     <i> solitude of the night.</i>

54
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:53,759
         <i> And I want to</i>
      <i> plunge into secrecy.</i>

55
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,794
     <i> As in to black smoke.</i>

56
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,729
          <i> To disappear</i>

57
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,222
<i>It was on this</i>

   <i> the idea of a sisterhood.</i>

59

      <i> Catherine Huang and</i>
  <i> Lavinia Hall were the first</i>

60

    <i> two girls to be trusted</i>
        <i> with the secret.</i>

61
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:02,327
Last week...

62
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,628
What?

63
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,634
I had this
      really bad thought.

64
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:14,673
Bad as in badass
        or bad/perverse?

65
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,442
Just bad.

66
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,544
       like I don't wanna
       say it out loud.

67
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,680
We're offline.

68
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,549
You can tell us.

69
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,518
       Or write it down.

70
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,221
       That's what I do.

71
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,943
You really
       can't tell anyone.

72
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,346
I won't, I promise.

73
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,748
...You have to swear.

74
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,206
It's our secret

75
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,611
            Cheers.

76
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,318
Are you kidding?

77
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,587
      Are you kidding me?

78
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,558
Everybody,
that's the fire alarm.

79
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,992
Single file.

80
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,794
Everybody
head for the exits.

81
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,996
Just leave
your belongings and

82
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,698
head to the exits.

83
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,667
No pushing.

84
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,445
Oh my God!

85
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,064
Everything that
   happens here stays between

86
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,966
        the three of us.

87
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,403
  You have my vow of silence.

88
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,873
You have
       my vow of silence.

89
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:09,481
You... have
       my vow of silence.

90
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,721
Are you ready?

91
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,916
I wouldn't say the
  Mary/Emily conflict was over

92
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,684
    by the end of the year,
      but they both moved

93
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:20,952
      on to other things.

94
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,121
 Mary with her photography and
  Emily with her acting class

95
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,123
        over the summer.

96
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,559
    Principal Harvey didn't
     think I needed to keep

97
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,160
       meeting with them.

98
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:34,966
But no one could have predicted
  what was going to happen...

99
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,176
<i>Dear God, please</i>
  <i> help me make some friends at</i>

00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,513
 <i> Please send Mary Warren away.</i>

102

   <i> Please help Mary see that</i>
     <i> she should forgive me</i>

104

         <i> and I'm sorry,</i>

       <i> One or the other.</i>

107
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,732
Catherine!

108
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,467
You're
going to be late.

109
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,606
I made you a BLT,
         your favorite.

110
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,976
I buy lunch on
   Fridays. Mommy knows that.

111
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:20,245
You're such
        a little poser.

112
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,815
Alright... well
 I'll pick you up after school.

113
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,283
         Four o'clock?

114
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,018
We'll go
       see her together.

115
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,919
Okay.

116
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,087
Bye Gong-gong.

117
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,789
Hey kit cat.

118
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,491
Hi.

119
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:37,495
      So my mom went back
       into the hospital.

120
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,531
             And...

121
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,707
   her hair is all gone now.

122
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,443
  I'm going to see her today.

123
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,714
         I just can't.

124
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,455
Are you okay, honey?

125
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,158
                        Lavinia?

126
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:33,711
Morning.

127
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:34,779
Hey.

128
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,884
They should really get
    that sign fixed for you.

129
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,352
Yeah, I know.

130
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,822
 But I secretly like It though.

131
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,758
      It keeps me humble.

132
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,894
      How's Lavinia doing?

133
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,664
       That good, huh...

134
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,534
 What's going on? Anything new?
        Any big changes?

135
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,838
Well, I just
        started dating.

136
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,207
Oh.

137
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,442
Maybe she should
    start coming in to talk

138
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,710
    to you again, you know?

139
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,478
 During lunch like last year...

140
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,013
       she said you were
        a good listener.

141
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,181
Yeah sure.
           I'm here.

142
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,616
       Just think it over
        and let me know.

143
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:12,750
Okay.

144
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,692
...Travis, definitely.

145
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,430
They're coming. Here they come.

146
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,975
<i>There were definitely</i>
  <i> rumors about The Sisterhood.</i>

147
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:40,845
    <i> Nobody knew what it was,</i>
   <i> which just made the girls</i>

148
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,014
     <i> who weren't in it want</i>
    <i> to be in it even more...</i>

149
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:46,217
          <i> But you had</i>
     <i> to be chosen by Mary.</i>

150
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,389
       <i> I was never really</i>
     <i> sure how Mary decided</i>

151
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,724
          <i> who to pick.</i>

152
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,326
   <i> We were all so different.</i>

153
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:03,167
  <i> With me, my family had just</i>
<i>moved to Kingston from Oregon.</i>

154
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:07,272
 <i> I remember that whole week,</i>
<i>I'd see Catherine Huang kind of</i>

155
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,173
          <i> watching me.</i>

156
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:14,412
<i>And one day it started pouring.</i>

157
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,683
    <i> Everyone ran for cover.</i>

158
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,819
      <i> But I love the rain.</i>

159
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,821
        <i> And I missed it.</i>

160
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,468
   <i> Soon after that, Mary and</i>
  <i> Catherine gave me the secret</i>

161
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,138
 <i> sign and you had to figure out</i>
  <i> where the meeting was based</i>

162
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,472
           <i> on a clue.</i>

163
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,274
We'll see you later.

164
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,209
Bye.

165
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,117
Mary said I
 introduced her to photography.

166
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:57,288
       She said she took
 photographs to observe a world

167
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,791
that just wanted to observe her,

168
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:04,495
 but what she taught me was how
  to see the mystery in life.

169
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,934
     You know, one of these
  nights I'm gonna follow you

170
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,036
   and find out what you do.

171
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,377
Where
were you at lunch?

172
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:25,016
I had to make
      up that Math test...

173
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:31,289
        Hey, what do you
   guys think of Jeff Johns?

174
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,324
I mean, he's cute.

175
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,393
He's always
     staring at you on the

176
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,428
    way to school you know.

177
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,933
Is he
      boyfriend material?

178
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,335
Okay, who
    would you guys save from

179
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,305
      a burning building,
  Jeff Johns or Ryan Gosling?

180
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,307
Sorry Jeff!

181
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:54,112
From the girl who
kisses his poster every night...

182
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,547
Oh guys, this is how I practice.

183
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,592
Wait, this is Travis
      I'm guessing, right?

184
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,227
Of course this is
 Travis, who else would it be?

185
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,350
You missed it!

186
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:35,553
Okay, okay, okay.
   I promise I won't do that.

187
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,255
         Keep twirling

188
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,189
Finally.

189
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,191
That's a good one.

190
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,592
Oh yeah
       you're crazy hot!

191
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,428
You're like so attractive.

192
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,429
Guys!

193
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:45,496
Keep going.

194
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,464
Hey guys, wait.

195
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,267
      Let's do something
     for the variety show.

196
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,569
Really?
   Like a dance or something?

197
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,604
Yeah. I mean like I
  can write the music and you

198
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,574
     can make the costumes
      and Mary, you can--

199
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,142
I'll bust a move.

200
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,411
No, but
        I mean seriously

201
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,080
      - I think we should.

202
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,281
Yeah, I think so too.

203
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:04,382
- It'll be fun.
- Let's do it.

204
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:07,518
But only if
       the song is like--

205
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,187
Amazing!

206
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,566
<i>More girls</i>
    <i> began to roam the night</i>

207
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:25,470
 <i> as new members were initiated.</i>

208
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,212
Not right now.

209
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,414
        Okay. Okay. Bye.

210
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,450
Don't forget to
      silence your phones.

211
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,421
Did you see her?

212
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,702
Honey, we can
               move up. Come on.

213
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,738
No! It's not fair.

214
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,705
Emily.

215
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,041
You don't know
      what she did to me!

216
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,744
She always
       ruins everything.

217
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:23,547
  Why don't you tell everybody
   where were you last night,
           huh, Mary?

218
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,716
       Why don't you tell
      everybody about the
   big secret you're hiding?

219
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,486
I saw her!
      I have the picture!

220
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,855
   Ask her what she was doing
    last night in the woods.

221
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,590
Honey, stop it.

222
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,497
               Oh, Emily! Emily!

223
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:40,364
Come here, honey.

224
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,233
Lie her down. Lie her down.

225
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:43,134
             Emily?

226
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,803
Are you alright?

227
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,171
Explain yourself--

228
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,105
Stop.

229
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:52,677
     Were you in the woods
     with Mary last night?

230
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:53,577
...yeah.

231
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,813
What were you even
      doing in the woods?!

232
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,181
Tom, take it easy.

233
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,849
Can I have a
        glass of water.

234
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,419
Sure.

235
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,822
Oh God, your hand!
       Tom, look at that.

236
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,824
Did this
       happen last night?

237
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,494
It really hurt...
        it was bleeding.

238
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,363
It's alright, honey.
        Don't be scared.

239
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,497
There's nothing to be scared of.

240
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,499
  Just tell us what happened.

241
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:20,571
We were all waiting
    after Emily's outburst.

242
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:23,641
   Mostly people were annoyed
   that mass was interrupted.

243
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:27,812
   None of us adults had ever
heard of The Sisterhood before.

244
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:30,281
And then Rhonda Potter came out.

245
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:33,818
 She had this look in her eye.

246
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,155
And I heard
      her say these words.

247
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,590
Three little words...

248
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,460
It's a cult.

249
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,714
You'll never
          be one of us

250
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:28,906
What was
            Emily talking about?

251
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,207
Mary?

252
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,742
Answer your mom!

253
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,546
We'll ground you.

254
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:38,749
How about a week with
    no phone and no computer

255
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:40,885
Oh great.

256
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,614
Oh hey, did
     you talk to your dad?

257
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,783
No way!
    I'm not saying anything.

258
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,922
That's Emily's mom.

259
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,124
She's walking up to your house!

260
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,059
Shh, wait a minute.

261
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,161
Your kid is
    totally out of control!

262
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,262
I understand
    that you're upset, Sue.

263
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,665
      But Mary would never
    physically hurt anyone--

264
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,300
Did you see the
      cut on Emily's hand?

265
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:32,436
And I am sure there
 is some explanation for that.

266
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:33,771
     We should just get the
   girls together and they'll

267
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:36,841
I think Mary's the one
   that needs the talking to.

268
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:38,342
That's
      between me and her.

269
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,144
   This conversation is over.

270
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,249
Uh oh

271
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:48,752
Incoming. Oh my God,
  Catherine, you're so busted!

272
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,254
What do I do?

273
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,326
Oh, hi.
      Hi. I'm Sue Parris.

274
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,603
Yes?

275
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:07,304
I'm Sue Parris.

276
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:08,239
How are you?

277
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:12,042
My daughter Emily
 goes to school with Catherine.

278
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,445
  And I really wanted to talk
   to you about what happened

279
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,780
        in church today.

280
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:20,851
 Is-- I know you weren't there.
         Is Grace here?

281
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,419
  Could the three of us talk?

282
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:24,021
That's not possible.

283
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,457
Could you step outside
      for a minute please?

284
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,895
I found this
       in Emily's jeans.

285
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:33,430
         Have you seen
      anything like that?

286
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:40,771
Hey. Hi. I am from
    the Kingston Chronicle.

287
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,773
This is so exciting!

288
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,975
I know both your
 daughters are involved in The

289
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:46,944
  Sisterhood, and I was hoping
   I could ask you a couple--

290
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:48,879
My daughter has
    nothing to do with this.

291
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,648
Okay, but--
This is my home!

292
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,416
Both of
       you, please leave.

293
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,652
I'm so sorry
       to have intruded.

294
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:55,986
Excuse
me, Mrs. Parris.

295
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,422
If I can
just ask you one thing.

296
00:25:58,424 --> 00:25:59,490
Oh, I have to--

297
00:25:59,492 --> 00:26:00,724
If I could, hey--
          Sorry.

298
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,894
You are on
               private property.

299
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,550
I want you to
       take one of these.

300
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:02,586
Dr. Post said it was okay.

301
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,488
      You had a long day.

302
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,558
      I want you to rest.

303
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,098
       Did you understand
     what the officer meant

304
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,068
    about pressing charges?

305
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,703
Kinda.

306
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:22,106
That unless you talk
    to him and you tell him

307
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:26,810
what's really going on there is
 nothing that he can really do.

308
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:33,651
But what would he do?

309
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:37,988
We can talk about
    it tomorrow. I love you.

310
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:46,964
  And good luck on that French
  test. "Maison" is feminine!

311
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,198
Okay, mom.
      That was last week.

312
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,900
We gotta
       talk later, kiddo.

313
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,175
Hey, Emily.

314
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,110
Hey...

315
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,179
How's your hand?

316
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,181
It hurts.

317
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,583
I saw the photo you
  posted of your boyfriend...

318
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:09,486
He probably wants to beat
  the crap out of Mary Warren.

319
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:12,589
Yeah, he's pretty mad...

320
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,191
...I heard
   Mr.Gambhir's interrogating

321
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,759
   all the Sisterhood girls.

322
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,661
It's like
        the Inquisition!

323
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:22,199
Tyra makes all the girls line up
  and then she tears 'em down!

324
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,101
Your name's
      on the list, Emily.

325
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:26,537
Good. As long
 as they get in trouble for...

326
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:28,539
      what they... did...

327
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,512
What's really going on?

328
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,451
      This is potentially
        really serious.

329
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:44,021
  I'm trying to help you here.

330
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:46,657
 You have to tell me something.

331
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:50,761
     Give me something that
    helps me help you guys.

332
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:53,130
  Who is your favorite Beatle?

333
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,445
Do you know,
   in ancient China, when you

334
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:12,449
    had a secret you didn't
   want to share with anyone,

335
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:15,052
  you would dig a hole into a
  tree, and then you'd whisper

336
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:18,555
   your secret into the hole.

337
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:22,025
 And then you'd fill it up with
  dirt and no one would know.

338
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,961
 You'd leave it there forever.

339
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,265
That's beautiful.
You hear that from your parents?

340
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:33,103
I saw it in a movie.

341
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,606
       And Lennon. That's
      my favorite Beatle.

342
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:36,673
     Whose your favorite?

343
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:38,675
George Harrison.

344
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:42,279
   But nobody knows anything
     about George Harrison.

345
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,081
  I like to keep his secrets.

346
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,130
Excuse me, Miss Warren.

347
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,901
 I ask her a question, she just
   does not saying anything.

348
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:05,335
  She just sits there quietly.

349
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,704
How's your hand, Emily?

350
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:11,308
   That must've really hurt.
When you slid down those rocks.

351
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,876
I don't know
   what she's talking about.

352
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,344
Because if you're
   not used to that drop-off,

353
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,914
   it's really easy to fall.

354
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,816
So you were
      in the woods, Mary?

355
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:19,983
I didn't say that.

356
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,820
You were chanting...

357
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:25,289
    You took off your shirt.

358
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,090
 You made me take off my shirt.

359
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:27,791
Stop it!

360
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:30,994
You grabbed my hands.

361
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,696
         You made me...

362
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,131
Say it.

363
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:36,967
You know
     exactly what you did!

364
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:49,646
It's true.
      I know, Mr. Gambhir.

365
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,648
     They did it to me too!

366
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,354
...Catherine?
       What's happening?

367
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,189
Get some water.

368
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,757
Are you okay? Hey.

369
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,625
I'll get the nurse.

370
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:02,759
Everybody back to class.

371
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,161
Go on back to class.

372
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,201
Sorry,
      the girls are just--

373
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:21,038
they're not really good friends.

374
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,806
I mean, they're kids that
     she's known for years

375
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:26,843
   but I don't think they're
    anybody we can rely on.

376
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:30,347
Just tell me-- how can we
     protect our daughter?

377
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,851
Look. Over here.
I found something.

378
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:37,254
- We found something.
- What's this?

379
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:40,424
Last night
  we found this in the woods.

380
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:43,393
     Come on, Mary. We know
     it's your handwriting.

381
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,996
I'm not saying anything!

382
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:48,098
Well then
  you'll be suspended. Again.

383
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,633
- Could I just intervene?
- I don't care!

384
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:50,968
Oh, but
    I bet you care about the

385
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,237
  Halloween dance... and what
    about the Variety Show?

386
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,606
       I know you've been
     practicing a routine.

387
00:32:56,608 --> 00:33:00,978
You're such a cliché.

388
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,379
I'll
    let you two get started.

389
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,523
I'm gonna have
          a cigarette.

390
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:16,159
If we're
      just gonna sit here

391
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,294
        staring at each
     other like last time,

392
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:18,328
    I might as well, right?

393
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,431
Are you crazy?

394
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,900
Yeah, you're right.
 You should probably stay here.

395
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:25,535
    I don't want you getting
     into any more trouble.

396
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,204
    Besides, it's only good
       for third period.

397
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:28,338
Where?

398
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,873
It's a secret spot.

399
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,112
<i>Now, you may</i>
       <i> be asking yourself</i>

400
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:11,481
    <i> why didn't we just tell?</i>

401
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:14,484
     <i> It's a fair question.</i>

402
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:18,822
       <i> Our silence became</i>
        <i> our holy grail.</i>

403
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,594
<i>In three days, our</i>
<i>world would come crashing down.</i>

404
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,400
Anyone who
   Googled Kingston New York

405
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,036
  a month ago would have read
     about a quiet town the

406
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:37,240
  local papers once called an
 "archetype of happy suburbia."

407
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,277
     Google Kingston today
     and a story of sex and

408
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,345
      the occult emerges.

409
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:47,050
Mary had this charisma
    but it was the kind that

410
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:49,419
      can turn dangerous.

411
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,322
    Look at The Sisterhood.

412
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,991
   Look what happened to me.

413
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:58,261
<i>Lizzie Ward said</i>
  <i> she was led to the cemetery,</i>
           <i> where the</i>

414
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,465
     <i> Sisterhood forced her</i>
     <i> to urinate on a Bible.</i>

415
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,000
<i>Sarah Burnhart</i>
   <i> claimed her initiation was</i>

416
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:08,138
      <i> sealed by drinking</i>
        <i> a whitish fluid.</i>

417
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:13,510
<i>Sarah remembered feeling out of</i>
  <i> control, and then fainting.</i>

418
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:16,546
 <i> Maria Cannito described a game</i>
       <i> called Band Camp,</i>

419
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:19,950
 <i> where girls had to wear masks</i>
   <i> and play their bodies like</i>

420
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:22,319
      <i> a musical instrument</i>
        <i> for strange men.</i>

421
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:25,455
I remember that game
    that Sarah talked about.

422
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,557
    Because I was the cello.

423
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,314
Where were you?

424
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:59,115
I just
      went out for a walk.

425
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:01,218
Don't lie, Lavinia .
          Do not lie.

426
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,588
     I've been waiting and
  so patient, and just waiting

427
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,489
     for you to talk to me,

428
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,991
           but now--

429
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,561
Maria Cannito just
     wrote on Emily's blog.

430
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,330
She says--
       she says you guys

431
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:14,731
         hurt her, too.

432
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,999
You went
        through my room?

433
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:18,468
Mom! What if I
    went through your room?!

434
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,904
But, Mom, I
      didn't do anything!

435
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,806
You're the one that
  goes out with different guys
          every night!

436
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:25,342
--while everyone
         else's parents

437
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:28,478
I hang out with my friends, Mom.
   What's so weird with that?

438
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,747
But what do you do when
you hang out with your friends?

439
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,016
What do you do in the middle of
 the night that you can't tell

440
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:34,217
         anyone about?

441
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:38,255
      Does this have to do
      with The Sisterhood?

442
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:39,689
No! Mom! Mom, stop!

443
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,057
        ROSE Let me see!

444
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,158
What are
        you doing? Mom!

445
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,493
Let--

446
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:55,505
  about The Sisterhood symbol
     having occult origins.

447
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,807
The inverted pentagram
  has a star with five points

448
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,443
   to symbolize the elements,
  earth, wind, fire and water

449
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,747
       and the spirit and
   The Sisterhood circle has

450
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:07,317
    these five x's embedded
      in the same places.

451
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,066
...just breathe...

452
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,592
Catherine?

453
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:51,294
         Are you awake?

454
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:22,892
What are you doing?

455
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:25,128
What is this all about?

456
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,430
How can you cause
      so much trouble when

457
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,798
       Mommy is so sick?

458
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,433
  What's the matter with you?

459
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,541
        I'm not going to
      say anything to her

460
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,844
and you're not going to either.

461
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:42,312
             Okay?

462
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:44,881
          Hau pu hau.

463
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:48,718
I'm scared.

464
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,454
Sweetheart,
        I'm scared too.

465
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:54,624
I just--- I just
 can't talk about it right now.

466
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,260
There's a reason it's a secret.

467
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:59,362
But you have to talk
    to me, because what if--

468
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,598
What if what?

469
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:08,371
There might be
   a time when it's just you,

470
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:10,240
          me and Henry

471
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:11,274
And Gong-Gong?

472
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:13,576
Yes, and Gong-Gong.

473
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,345
          Catherine--

474
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:16,946
Catherine--

475
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,214
Catherine.

476
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,592
<i>Someone asked me today</i>
  <i> if I felt like Joan of Arc.</i>

477
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:35,865
 <i> One day we will all be dead.</i>

478
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:38,735
      <i> But those who keep</i>
     <i> moving will never die.</i>

479
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:45,175
   <i> What happens in the woods</i>
  <i> at the end of our ritual is</i>

480
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,378
         <i> inexplicable.</i>

481
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,846
   <i> A clear, unspeakable calm.</i>

482
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,619
           <i> What shall</i>
     <i> we do, little</i> sisters?

483
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,655
      <i> The sky is falling.</i>

484
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,899
You look a little
      Courtney Love today.

485
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:12,769
  Before she went red carpet.

486
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:14,504
I feel
         Courtney Love.

487
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,810
Catherine,
       you're going to be

488
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,245
      late for career day.

489
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,750
I'll pick
      you up after school

490
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:32,755
     to go see Mommy, okay?

491
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,290
She says she can't.

492
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:36,726
She has
      to study for a test.

493
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:40,263
Well you can
     study at the hospital.

494
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:45,034
She says "no".

495
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:46,336
Catherine,
     cut it out. Ni zen mo

496
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:50,273
I can't do it!
    She looks like an alien!

497
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:52,742
   She's bald and it smells -
            I can't!

498
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:55,979
         Just stop it!

499
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:58,615
Catherine!

500
00:41:58,617 --> 00:41:59,849
Catherine.

501
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,262
You don't know
    how out of hand this is.

502
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,867
       We need you here.

503
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,837
Is Dad coming?

504
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,071
...No, but--

505
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:23,873
It's
    fine. I don't even care.

506
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,321
Good morning everyone.
     Good morning parents.

507
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:39,756
     Welcome to career day.
     Thank you for coming.

508
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,826
We've got some great speakers--

509
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:45,728
This is a public service

510
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,331
announcement.

511
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,899
I'm locked in here --

512
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,601
- I
- speak to you anonymously

513
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,570
about the recent
slanderous statements

514
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:54,904
made by my classmates.

515
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:58,508
For which the reason is
Jealousy.

516
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,742
The Sisterhood has given

517
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,111
meaning to our lives.

518
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:03,346
Miss Potter?

519
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:04,314
Hello?

520
00:43:04,316 --> 00:43:05,682
To those of you who ask why

521
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:08,351
we are bound by a vow
of silence, I reply:

522
00:43:08,353 --> 00:43:12,755
to tell you the secret means
to lose The Sisterhood forever.

523
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,457
Listen to me.

524
00:43:14,459 --> 00:43:15,959
Disregard these lies
and trust your daughters.

525
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,971
Hello

526
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:29,138
Hey, Mr. Gambhir.

527
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,440
Hey.

528
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:31,774
What's that?

529
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:32,875
Hey guys.

530
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,677
Say front page!

531
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,992
Hey.

532
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:53,396
Chocolate milk for me
   and soy chocolate for you.

533
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:55,131
How did you
        know I'm vegan?

534
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:58,434
I see you at
     the faculty cafeteria.

535
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,004
Steve Harvey thought
      I should talk to you

536
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:02,605
    before the PTA meeting.

537
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:08,444
 I'm just so worried about her,
  and I think-- She hates me.

538
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:10,446
She doesn't hate you.

539
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:14,884
Rose, they're at that
 age where everything is like,

540
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:17,520
  "Oh, nobody understands me."

541
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:19,522
     When I was sixteen, I
   ended up getting a tattoo.

542
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:21,190
What'd you get?

543
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:23,960
On my tattoo?
         I'll show you.

544
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:25,795
      Actually, what am I
    doing. I can't show you.

545
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:27,797
     I'll show you later--

546
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:29,198
      That came out wrong,
       I don't mean that

547
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,500
    I'm going to show you--

548
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,935
            Anyway--

549
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:35,738
Do you have--
Oh yeah. Here--

550
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,607
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

551
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:40,843
Sorry about that.

552
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,613
       Why don't you take
        care of those--

553
00:44:43,615 --> 00:44:45,948
I don't deserve to live.
           I'm sorry.

554
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,183
It's okay.

555
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,919
I haven't
      laughed in a while.

556
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,254
Oh good, I'm glad you
    thought that was funny.

557
00:44:51,256 --> 00:44:52,522
That was nice.

558
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,879
Hey Emily.

559
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,247
I know your boyfriend's a fake.

560
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,917
      You are such a liar.

561
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:22,618
   Did you really think that
    you could just make this

562
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:27,156
   fake Facebook account for
  "Brad MacLaughlin, front man

563
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,693
 of Aussie boy band Tidal Wave"

564
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:32,995
        and pass him off
       as your boyfriend?

565
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:34,697
            Really?!

566
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,599
       I wonder what else
    you lied about, Emily...

567
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:39,936
WTF, Catherine!

568
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:41,104
...you guys are fearless.

569
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:44,273
They're totally going
  to Hell for not confessing.

570
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:45,908
Mary doesn't
   care about going to Hell.

571
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,978
       They'll never say
      anything. It's sad.

572
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,213
Hi Emily.

573
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:51,614
I heard
Lavinia Hall crying in

574
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:53,082
      the bathroom today.

575
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,684
      She's totally going
       in the psych ward.

576
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:58,554
   They'll probably be devils
   or witches for Halloween.

577
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:00,590
I bet Lavinia
         would confess.

578
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,397
So can I tell
 Emily you're in for Halloween?

579
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,035
Lavinia.

580
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:15,104
      It's Lavinia, right?

581
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:18,107
     I hear you like girls.

582
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,576
          That's hot!

583
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:23,146
Wait! Come back!
     I wanna be initiated!

584
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,122
         Yeah, I'm in.

585
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,961
Lavinia?

586
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,276
I hear you're
     the leader of a cult.

587
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:33,716
Voodoo, I made
       us a new playlist.

588
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:35,318
Seriously...

589
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,322
 you just get together to hang
out and talk about stuff, right?

590
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,128
I can't break the vow.

591
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,197
I trusted you.

592
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:52,368
        You have to tell
      me what's going on.

593
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,704
      I don't wanna sneak
        around anymore.

594
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,706
       I'm just not into
  being your secret boyfriend.

595
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,688
Should I
     use the pink feathers

596
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:16,225
    or the brown feathers?

597
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:19,195
Whatever you think.

598
00:48:19,197 --> 00:48:20,796
I wonder if
      my mom will be home.

599
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:26,035
     You know, in time for
       the variety show.

600
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,205
Mary...?

601
00:48:29,207 --> 00:48:31,974
Do you ever wish you
 could just live inside a song?

602
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:34,443
Ugh, stop it.
You're obsessed with this song.

603
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:35,678
            Come on.

604
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,081
If I hear
it one more time...

605
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,417
This curfew
                makes me insane.

606
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,252
                     I gotta go.

607
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:05,841
Jeff.

608
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,322
Mary? Is that you?

609
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,890
 Why are you out after curfew?

610
00:49:54,892 --> 00:49:56,525
Why are you
       out after curfew?

611
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:58,527
I'm an adult, the
  curfew doesn't apply to me.

612
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:03,332
Can I--
         can I come in?

613
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,501
     The cops are circling
       the neighborhood.

614
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:07,269
Mary, that's
        not appropriate.

615
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:12,008
 My dad's working in the city.
    I really don't care what

616
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,109
         my mom thinks.

617
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:14,176
Sorry, Mary.

618
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,544
  That's really inappropriate.

619
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:17,313
Please.

620
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,052
            Please.

621
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:25,187
Can I use your bathroom?

622
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,050
Xanax. Sleep.

623
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,528
Mary listen,
      we got to get going.

624
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,963
Hey Mr. Gambhir,
           what's...

625
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:09,331
           No-vo-al--

626
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,834
Whoa, Mary, come on!

627
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:13,602
    That stuff is personal.

628
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:15,337
       You can't just go
    through people's things.

629
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:16,972
   Do I have to go in there,
   see what else is missing?

630
00:51:16,974 --> 00:51:18,274
No!

631
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:21,410
     God! Don't freak out.

632
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,145
     I was just wondering.

633
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:24,980
    Since I just took some.

634
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:26,549
Oh my God.

635
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:29,285
           How many?

636
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:30,586
Two.

637
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:36,125
What's this?

638
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:42,431
JENNIFER
           Hi Emily.

639
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:46,936
  <i> My name is Jennifer, and I'm</i>
 <i> from Albuquerque, New Mexico.</i>

640
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:50,940
  <i> I know that your blog is for</i>
    <i> Sisterhood victims, but</i>

641
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:55,111
    <i> I've been molested too.</i>

642
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:59,248
  <i> I know this is a safe place.</i>

643
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:04,520
 <i> I have to tell you about what</i>
 <i> happened with my babysitter...</i>

644
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:09,024
      <i> It was so long ago,</i>

645
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:11,360
    <i> but I have to speak up.</i>

646
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:12,595
           <i> It's time.</i>

647
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,314
Jeff,

648
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:35,818
      he won't talk to me.

649
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,790
<i> This</i>
   <i> mailbox is full and cannot</i>

650
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:16,992
      <i> accept any messages</i>
     <i> at this time. Goodbye.</i>

651
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:22,731
Shit

652
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:46,021
Good night, Ryan.

653
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,355
Hi.

654
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:21,323
I'm really sorry, Mr. G.

655
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:22,725
It's okay.

656
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:25,527
    I'll see you at school.

657
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:27,296
Mary?

658
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:29,765
Mary, I know you're in there.
Open the door.

659
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:52,254
What were you
       doing over there?

660
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:55,157
    How do you think I felt?

661
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:56,792
     I'm checking my e-mail
and there's a photo of you with

662
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,827
      a teacher, at night!

663
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:00,496
      And then you weren't
         in your room--

664
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:04,466
Everyone knows...Sue
  Parris sent it to everyone!

665
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,768
    Including the Chronicle.

666
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:11,173
Are you having
       sex with that man?

667
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:14,209
Am I what?

668
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:16,178
Is that what you
   wrote on the secret sign?

669
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,114
No! How can
     you even ask me that?!

670
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:21,417
Because I need to know
 the truth and for once you're

671
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:23,752
       going to tell me!

672
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:26,121
Okay, Mom.

673
00:55:26,123 --> 00:55:29,291
      I'm a witch, and The
     Sisterhood is a cult.

674
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,830
What are you doing?

675
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,500
Stop acting so crazy!

676
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:41,837
     God, what's happened?

677
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:45,207
   Why are we such strangers?

678
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:46,975
Because I don't
       wanna be like you.

679
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:54,316
I just don't know
        what to believe?

680
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:56,352
I think it's more
    like who do you believe.

681
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,220
Mary.

682
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,375
Have you spent the night at
Gambhir's apartment?

683
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:20,976
Is he part of The
    Sisterhood's erotic rituals?

684
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:33,389
REPORTER #3
Mary, are you in the
lesbian sex cult?

685
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:40,629
You have not come up
  with one answer. One answer!

686
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:44,433
      We left you with our
   daughters. We trusted you!

687
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:47,169
Linda,
  did Mary tell you anything?

688
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:48,670
She said
       nothing happened.

689
00:56:48,672 --> 00:56:49,805
And
      do you believe her?

690
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:51,306
Mary's telling
           the truth.

691
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:53,375
You know what - that
 doesn't get you off the hook!

692
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:56,712
  You let a student spend the
    night in your apartment.

693
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:59,748
     A girl who is confused
   and in way over her head.

694
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,949
Look, I was
        trying to help.

695
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:02,584
      Mary was very upset.

696
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:06,288
  I tried to call you, Linda,
  but your voicemail was full.

697
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,290
Gordy, I need your resignation.

698
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:18,333
Why was
       she at his house?

699
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,401
I don't know.

700
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:24,540
Hey, chicas.

701
00:57:24,542 --> 00:57:28,310
 Look, I really wasn't sneaking
    out to meet Mr. Gambhir.

702
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:30,245
Then where
     were you going, Mary?

703
00:57:30,247 --> 00:57:32,681
Everything is
    just so messed up, Mary.

704
00:57:32,683 --> 00:57:36,452
  We have to tell them, okay.
     Can we just tell them?

705
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:38,854
What about the vow?

706
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:40,923
Forget
       the fricking vow.

707
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:44,626
     Everyone's waiting for
      you to do something!

708
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,296
Lavinia?
       We're going home.

709
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:48,697
              Now!

710
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,342
I think we have to.

711
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:01,810
     We have to tell them.

712
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:10,719
Lavinia!

713
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:14,990
I tried to fix it,
   but it won't play anymore,

714
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:18,260
    so here's mine. On loan.

715
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:22,798
   I'll figure something out,
           I promise.

716
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,399
Hey, come on.

717
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,776
"I confronted my
   cousin and he admitted it.

718
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,813
      I couldn't have done
     it without you, Emily!

719
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:41,817
  Here's a song that keeps me
    strong." From KandyKane.

720
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:45,220
Whoa, her cousin?
          That's wild!

721
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:53,862
How are these
       girls finding me?

722
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:14,716
What is The Sisterhood?

723
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,386
What is The Sisterhood?

724
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:18,487
What is The Sisterhood?

725
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:29,531
Gordy Gambhir will not be
leading the meeting tonight.

726
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:31,466
I know that you have a
lot of questions, and we

727
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:34,369
will get to your
questions one-by-one.

728
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:36,772
       Now we've already
  cancelled the variety show--

729
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:38,640
Mr. G.

730
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:41,343
What are
        you doing here?

731
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:42,611
You said to give
     them a chance, right?

732
00:59:42,613 --> 00:59:43,946
There's
a lot that we still

733
00:59:43,948 --> 00:59:46,782
don't know about The Sisterhood,
but tonight I feel confident

734
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:50,218
  that we can begin a dialogue
   that will bring some calm

735
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,286
       to the community.

736
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:57,025
          And we need
    to support each other--

737
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:58,126
 Mary, what are you doing here?

738
00:59:58,128 --> 00:59:59,061
Let her speak!

739
00:59:59,063 --> 01:00:00,395
Yeah!

740
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:08,637
What
      do you have to say?

741
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:10,806
I...

742
01:00:10,808 --> 01:00:14,843
   came here tonight to talk
  to you about The Sisterhood.

743
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:17,746
We haven't done anything wrong.

744
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:19,715
 And neither has Mr. Gambhir--

745
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:24,019
Mr. Gambhir
         is backstage.

746
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:26,822
If he's not part of The
  Sisterhood, why is he here?

747
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,462
Is there a
      reason you're here?

748
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:34,730
Gordy,
     you shouldn't be here.

749
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:35,831
I'm here on my own.

750
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:38,433
You should leave.

751
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:41,036
Look, I can't
     tell you exactly what

752
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:44,973
 The Sisterhood is... but I do
know things about your daughters

753
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,175
      from just having the
    chance to talk to them--

754
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:48,477
Mrs. Warren, are
   you going to press charges

755
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:51,013
       against this man?

756
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:51,847
Gordy --

757
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:52,681
Mr. Gambhir.

758
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:54,616
          Mr. Gambhir!

759
01:00:54,618 --> 01:00:57,052
Look, they're just
     girls! Listen to them!

760
01:00:57,054 --> 01:00:58,687
Listen , please.

761
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:00,489
After what they
   put my families through?!

762
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:11,099
They're still
        your daughters.

763
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:12,968
Mom.

764
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,604
It's okay. I'm here.
        I believe you--

765
01:01:15,606 --> 01:01:16,738
Mary, Mrs. Warren, right here!

766
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,508
Get the
       hell out of here.

767
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,621
<i>Dear God,</i>
   <i> I'm so grateful for today.</i>

768
01:01:32,623 --> 01:01:35,190
<i>I feel like so many things have</i>
<i>been leading up to this moment.</i>

769
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:42,864
<i>Sit with my mouth</i>
 <i> 3 inches from the microphone.</i>

770
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,802
   <i> Try not to accentuate my</i>
   <i> P's or whistle on my S's.</i>

771
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:50,672
 <i> Please. Perfectly. Sisterhood.</i>

772
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:52,140
      <i> Stay in the moment.</i>

773
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:54,576
      <i> Use my imagination.</i>

774
01:01:54,578 --> 01:01:58,080
       <i> Remember my wants,</i>
     <i> needs, and objectives.</i>

775
01:01:58,082 --> 01:02:00,649
      <i> Amen-- oh, and thank</i>
     <i> you for letting me go</i>

776
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:02,484
        <i> to my first real</i>
    <i> Halloween party tonight!</i>

777
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:06,154
          <i> Amen again.</i>

778
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:08,590
<i>Anyone</i>
  <i> can read Emily Parris' blog.</i>

779
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:10,258
       <i> which has become a</i>
  <i> confessional meeting ground</i>

780
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,160
   <i> for sexually abused girls.</i>

781
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:15,163
 <i> Miranda M. of Cleveland, Ohio</i>
  <i> and Jasmin22 of Middleburg,</i>

782
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:17,833
   <i> Virginia spoke about their</i>
 <i> experiences of sexual assault</i>

783
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:20,001
       <i> for the very first</i>
     <i> time on Parris' blog,</i>

784
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:21,169
     <i> both through artwork.</i>

785
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:25,607
Sorry.

786
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:31,213
...the first
             time he touched me,

787
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:34,750
           it was in my bedroom.

788
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:36,785
I was only nine.

789
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:38,620
         I didn't know.

790
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:47,262
The words to define
    that experience don't exist.

791
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:49,664
Who are
       those other girls?

792
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:51,666
You know them,
    you just never met them.

793
01:02:51,668 --> 01:02:53,268
That's KandyKane and Jennifer

794
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,604
from New Mexico, Jasmin22...

795
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:59,608
Our sponsor flew them out at the
last minute to surprise you.

796
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,843
I would
     just lie there, wait for it

797
01:03:01,845 --> 01:03:04,045
                   to be over...

798
01:03:04,047 --> 01:03:06,681
I haven't spoken
     him in over ten years.

799
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:08,250
I hope he's out there listening.

800
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:19,761
Joining us now,
 the reason this special group

801
01:03:19,763 --> 01:03:23,965
has come together. Emily Parris.

802
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:28,203
Emily it's me,
    KandyKane from St.Louis!

803
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:30,906
  I never thought I'd have the
  guts to go on the radio and

804
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:32,908
      talk like this but--

805
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,812
        You inspired me.

806
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:37,879
        She inspires me.

807
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,220
You're
      so pretty in person.

808
01:03:45,222 --> 01:03:47,255
       She's so pretty--

809
01:03:47,257 --> 01:03:50,325
Emily, can you
  tell our listeners about the

810
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,227
situation in Kingston, New York?

811
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,365
         What happened?

812
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:59,234
       What's happening?

813
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,758
We were molested.

814
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,368
What happened?
         Are you okay?

815
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:35,971
It's just
     really hot in there...

816
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:37,672
 Seeing those girls in person -
       it's just so hard.

817
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:41,009
     I don't feel so great.

818
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:43,245
You can pop a Tylenol
 when we get back to my place.

819
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:44,679
You packed your costume, right?

820
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,214
I love that
         we all match!

821
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:47,682
I just...

822
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:49,351
       I don't know if we
     should do it anymore.

823
01:04:49,353 --> 01:04:53,121
But Travis said he's
  in and it has to be tonight.

824
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:54,623
To go with
     the whole witch thing.

825
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:56,258
Yeah, and what about
        the party after?

826
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:59,661
What if we
     just go to the party?

827
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:01,963
Why're you freaking out?

828
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:05,133
       I think you liked
     what they did to you.

829
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:07,369
I can't
      sleep over anymore.

830
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:08,703
There you are.

831
01:05:08,705 --> 01:05:09,671
Mom.

832
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:11,907
Hey.

833
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:13,942
I wanna go home.

834
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:16,811
What if she
         tells her mom?

835
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:17,879
She won't.

836
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:21,176
Hello?

837
01:06:21,178 --> 01:06:23,178
You have
        to come with me.

838
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:25,046
I need you.
I can't do this alone.

839
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,460
Lavinia, there's
           something I need to--

840
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:40,862
Are you
     going on another date?

841
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:42,797
       You can just say.

842
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:46,768
Yes, I am.
   The same guy, the dentist.

843
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:49,371
 So Mrs. Olsen's going to stay.

844
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:59,147
I love you.

845
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,261
Hello?

846
01:07:46,263 --> 01:07:48,797
Lavinia. Do
you know who this is?

847
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:54,135
I don't know.

848
01:07:54,137 --> 01:07:56,071
I think
you're hot.

849
01:07:56,073 --> 01:07:57,539
Now do you know?

850
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:00,375
Can you come
meet me at the sign?

851
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,043
I don't know.

852
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,312
Come on.

853
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:05,914
It's Halloween.

854
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:07,215
I don't
      even have a costume.

855
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:10,018
I have
one for you...

856
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:25,200
<i> Hi, you've called Lavinia.</i>

857
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:27,001
                 <i> Please leave a</i>
        <i> message after the beep.</i>

858
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:31,106
<i>Hi Lavinia,</i>
                    <i> it's Emily.</i>

859
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:34,109
           <i> If Travis calls you,</i>
          <i> don't go out tonight.</i>

860
01:08:34,111 --> 01:08:36,144
                 <i> Just don't go.</i>

861
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:37,212
                      <i> Trust me.</i>

862
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,579
It's the tattoo.

863
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:19,647
     Five girls. Five x's.

864
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:30,425
Hi Lavinia.

865
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:31,492
Hi...

866
01:10:31,494 --> 01:10:32,760
Let's go for a walk.

867
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:34,762
Okay.

868
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,234
Wanna sit?

869
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:40,635
Sure.

870
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,217
Lavinia...

871
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,358
       have you ever made
       out with someone?

872
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:07,028
No.

873
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:10,198
Do you want to?

874
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,700
Yeah.

875
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:16,337
           With you.

876
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:18,239
Can you
      take your shirt off?

877
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:46,634
      You're so beautiful.

878
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:49,203
No I'm not...

879
01:11:49,205 --> 01:11:50,271
Yeah, you really are.

880
01:11:56,211 --> 01:12:01,182
       So what's the deal
      with the Sisterhood?

881
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:09,691
OMG, I
       can't believe her!

882
01:12:09,693 --> 01:12:11,326
Travis...?

883
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:14,128
            Travis!

884
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:17,699
        No! No! Please!

885
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,167
No!

886
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:07,482
I'm mean to my sister
because she's prettier than me.

887
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,085
I read my
        dad's Playboys.

888
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:09,510
I kissed
        a girl at camp.

889
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:12,280
I make
        myself throw up.

890
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:15,283
I keep skipping gym
   so I don't have to change

891
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:16,551
      in front of anyone.

892
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,592
Doug Ryan never called
     me after we hooked up.

893
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:28,896
       Because I wouldn't
        go down on him.

894
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:36,871
When I'm
    really mad I cut myself.

895
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:43,511
...I'm scared
      I'll never be happy.

896
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,280
This is the
    only place I feel safe.

897
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:58,226
<i>My dad lost his</i>
<i>job, and we might have to move.</i>

898
01:14:58,228 --> 01:14:59,627
   <i> I'm scared for my brother.</i>

899
01:14:59,629 --> 01:15:00,962
<i>I had an abortion.</i>

900
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:04,265
<i>Sometimes I tell my</i>
  <i> mom I'm with</i> my<i> friends and</i>

901
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:05,633
   <i> I drive to the city alone.</i>

902
01:15:05,635 --> 01:15:07,235
<i>Most of the</i>
     <i> time I feel invisible.</i>

903
01:15:07,237 --> 01:15:08,836
<i>When I write poems,</i>
    <i> I try to think like God.</i>

904
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:10,771
<i>I want to</i>
       <i> change the world.</i>

905
01:15:10,773 --> 01:15:11,906
<i>I lost</i>
         <i> my virginity.</i>

906
01:15:11,908 --> 01:15:15,309
<i>My</i>
       <i> spirit is a song.</i>

907
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:17,378
<i>No one's</i>
     <i> ever going to kiss</i> me.

908
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:23,417
<i>I wish my mom</i>
   <i> would die - or get better.</i>

909
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:31,025
<i>For my first time,</i>
     <i> I want to be</i> in love,

910
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,560
       <i> not just have sex.</i>

911
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:59,353
I've been afraid
     to say this until now,

912
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:01,322
       I love Jeff Johns.

913
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,670
I miss my mom.

914
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,027
<i>Why's she coming</i>
     <i> with us to the party?</i>

915
01:17:46,029 --> 01:17:47,061
<i>Why are you coming?</i>

916
01:17:47,063 --> 01:17:48,195
<i>Shut up!</i>

917
01:17:48,197 --> 01:17:50,197
<i>I want her to.</i>

918
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:52,667
        <i> We'll let her go</i>
        <i> after the party.</i>

919
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:54,835
<i>Yeah, she's still</i>
      <i> pretty drugged out.</i>

920
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:19,226
What a freak!

921
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:48,189
We're witches! Okay?

922
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,099
What's going on?

923
01:18:58,101 --> 01:19:01,102
          No! No! No!

924
01:19:01,104 --> 01:19:05,039
        Travis - please!

925
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:31,866
Just let me go home!

926
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:40,875
What
 are you going to do with that?

927
01:19:40,877 --> 01:19:42,777
It's already done!

928
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:52,253
Dad?

929
01:19:52,255 --> 01:19:53,821
Are you there? This is Lavinia.

930
01:19:57,759 --> 01:20:01,662
        This recording?

931
01:20:01,664 --> 01:20:05,065
         I can't sleep.

932
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:06,133
 I just wish it were tomorrow.

933
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:58,012
Please hurry.

934
01:21:58,014 --> 01:22:00,147
She's not-- she's not breathing.

935
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:04,218
She's not moving,
  I don't know what happened.

936
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:05,786
Lavinia?

937
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,428
We're
  standing outside St. John's

938
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:49,763
  church in Kingston, New York
  where Lavinia Hall's funeral

939
01:22:49,765 --> 01:22:51,265
will be taking place in an hour.

940
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:53,033
      Lavinia Hall is the
  fifteen-year-old high school

941
01:22:53,035 --> 01:22:56,737
      student who took her
      own life last week.

942
01:22:56,739 --> 01:22:59,006
- You got it?
- Yep.

943
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:13,954
<i>Dear God...</i>

944
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:34,041
Will you
      do something for me?

945
01:23:34,043 --> 01:23:35,109
Yeah. Anything.

946
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:37,471
I'm sorry, Mary.

947
01:24:37,473 --> 01:24:39,306
         I'm so sorry!

948
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:53,120
I... lied
       about that night.

949
01:24:53,122 --> 01:24:57,091
I just wanted
    to be in The Sisterhood.

950
01:24:57,093 --> 01:25:00,594
          Mary saw me.

951
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:03,997
<i>Then they just</i>
  <i> walked me out of the woods.</i>

952
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:07,434
Please.

953
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:10,971
I could just tell
      everyone everything!

954
01:25:10,973 --> 01:25:13,407
 And then you wouldn't be able
 to meet in the woods anymore.

955
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:23,183
<i> I was so mad.</i>

956
01:25:23,185 --> 01:25:24,618
            <i> I fell.</i>

957
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,253
         I cut my hand.

958
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:33,026
        And that was it.

959
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:40,367
 I should have helped Lavinia,

960
01:25:40,369 --> 01:25:42,402
     but I was too scared.

961
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:50,944
         I'm so sorry.

962
01:25:50,946 --> 01:25:53,380
           I'm sorry.

963
01:25:53,382 --> 01:25:54,448
         I'm so sorry.

964
01:26:56,344 --> 01:26:58,579
<i>Emily</i>
       <i> was wrong to lie.</i>

965
01:26:58,581 --> 01:27:00,047
  <i> But she helped me speak out.</i>

966
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:05,152
And her blog helped
  me find so many other girls

967
01:27:05,154 --> 01:27:06,787
who needed to speak their truth.

968
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,087
Hi.

969
01:27:40,089 --> 01:27:41,755
Hi, Mrs. Hall.

970
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:56,670
That's her song
     for the Variety Show.

971
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:03,210
"L' Espirits
          Des Animaux"

972
01:28:03,212 --> 01:28:05,679
        Spirit Animals.

973
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:09,783
      I think we should do
    the dance. For Lavinia.

974
01:28:15,723 --> 01:28:17,424
So this
      is your secret spot?

975
01:28:17,426 --> 01:28:18,792
Yeah.

976
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:30,137
What are you doing?

977
01:28:30,139 --> 01:28:31,438
        Can I do it too?

978
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:56,863
I changed my mind
  I don't wanna do it anymore.

979
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,367
You don't
        have to, Henry.

980
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:06,707
Ah, hi
    Gong-Gong. I was just--

      your beautiful hair?

986
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:30,424
Sweet dreams.

987
01:30:30,426 --> 01:30:32,893
I love you, baby.
