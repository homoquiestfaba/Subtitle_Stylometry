Captain!

5
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:36,101
Who are you?

6
00:02:28,912 --> 00:02:31,420
- What is this man?
- Your Majesty...

7
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:35,831
- We caught him up in our fishing nets.
- He's been telling stories, stories that...

8
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:37,729
We believe he's found him...

9
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:47,333
Ponce de León...

10
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:50,985
He said he found
Ponce de Leon's ship.

11
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:54,791
- He sailed on it.
- No, I told you...

12
00:02:55,192 --> 00:03:00,220
- Ponce de Leon died 200 years ago.
- Aye, but he died searching for something, didn't he?

13
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,961
The Fountain of Youth...

14
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:12,370
How soon can you sail?

15
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:15,523
With the tide.

LONDON ENGLAND

18
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:40,636
Pirates execution today!

19
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:42,261
Watch him swing.

20
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:47,555
Hurry papa, or we'll miss the hanging.

21
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:51,635
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.
The hanging comes this afternoon.

22
00:03:55,122 --> 00:03:57,946
Come on!
On your feet.

23
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,053
Move along, pirate!

24
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:04,980
Or should I say Captain pirate!

25
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:08,608
Come on.

26
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:10,403
Order!

27
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:19,551
Now appearing before the courts, the
notorious and infamous pirate...

28
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:22,368
...pillager and highwayman,
Captain Jack Sparrow!

29
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:31,593
I told ya. Me names Gibbs. Joshamee Gibbs.
How many times do I have to...

30
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:36,702
Hear Ye, Hear Ye. Presiding over these
trials, all rise and attend...

31
00:04:36,803 --> 00:04:38,974
the right Honorable Justice Smith!

32
00:04:54,964 --> 00:04:57,702
Quiet!

33
00:04:57,703 --> 00:04:59,668
Now...

34
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:04,613
- What do we have here?
- Jack?

35
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,068
Not necessary.

36
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:11,763
You were saying?

37
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:16,149
Jack Sparrow is not my name.
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.

38
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,111
Is that so? It says Jack Sparrow here.

39
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:26,101
I told em. I'm not Jack Sparrow, who I would be happy
to identify to the court, if it would help my case.

40
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:30,228
I think that would be a poor defense. Unless you
want to be bludgeoned again like a harp seal.

41
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:36,135
Prisoner claiming to be innocent to
being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?

42
00:05:37,114 --> 00:05:41,851
- No trial? But aren't we here to examine the evidence?
- Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

43
00:05:41,852 --> 00:05:44,380
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.

44
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:47,712
Hang him! String him up!

45
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:52,468
- Guilty?
- That's not fair!

46
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,539
Shut it!

47
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,914
Joshamee Gibbs. For the crime of which
you've been found guilty of.

48
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:01,408
Of being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.

49
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:04,661
I hereby commute your sentence...

50
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:10,235
and order that you be imprisoned for the remainder
of your miserable, morible, mutton chop life.

51
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,465
- What?
- Hang him!

52
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:13,764
There!

53
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:18,389
String him up! Hang him high!

54
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:22,839
It needs to be arranged to transport this
prisoner to the Tower of London!

55
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:36,607
Thank you very much.

56
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:47,498
Get up you!

57
00:06:56,893 --> 00:07:00,436
Hell, horse and teeth. Now we're both headed
for prison.

58
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:03,336
Not to worry. I've paid off the driver.

59
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:08,031
Ten minutes we'll be outside London town
horses waitin and tonight we'll make the coast.

60
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:10,555
Then it's just a matter of finding the ship.

61
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,767
- All part of a plan, yes?
- Exactly.

62
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,390
I arrived in London town just this
morning to rescue one Joshamee...

63
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:20,380
...Gibbs from one appointment with the
gallows.

64
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:24,680
Seeing as how you're still alive, I'd say
it's all been very successful this far.

65
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:29,746
What happened to you, Gibbs? I thought you
were employed elsewhere or otherwise engaged.

66
00:07:29,747 --> 00:07:33,496
Aye, but I always listen like a thief for
news of the Black Pearl.

67
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:35,867
Nobody see where she might next make
port.

68
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:37,870
Then I hear a rumor.

69
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:41,385
Jack Sparrow's in London. With
a ship, and lookin for a crew.

70
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:43,576
- Am not.
- But that's what I heard.

71
00:07:43,577 --> 00:07:47,602
Fact is, your signing up me ??. Pub
called the Captains Daughter.

72
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:50,989
- Am not!
- Well I thought it a bit odd.

73
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,228
But then you've never been the most
predictable of sorts.

74
00:07:55,455 --> 00:08:00,541
Tell me something. There is another Jack
Sparrow out there sullying my good name?

75
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:03,060
- An imposter.
- Indeed.

76
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:08,186
- But... an imposter with a ship.
- And in need of a crew.

77
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:11,741
Which as fate would have it, so am I.

78
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:17,909
How bout you, Jack? Last I heard you
were hellbent to find the Fountain of Youth.

79
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:20,321
Any luck?

80
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:24,660
Circumstances arose and forced compelling
insights

81
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,682
...regarding discretion and valor.

82
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:29,761
- Meaning, ye gave up.
- I did not!

83
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:33,025
I'm just as bent as ever.
Hellishly so.

84
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:38,392
I shall taste those waters first Gibbs.
Mark my words.

85
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:42,116
Oh. Short trip.

86
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:53,419
All part of the plan, yeah?

87
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:58,305
No!

88
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:29,449
You are Jack Sparrow?

89
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,219
There should be a "Captain" in there
somewhere.

90
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,143
I've heard of you.
And you know who I am.

91
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:40,707
Face is familiar. Have I threatened
you before?

92
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:44,726
You are in the presence of George Augustus
Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg...

93
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,633
Art treasurer and print selector of
the Holy Roman Empire...

94
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:51,307
King of Great Britain and Ireland.
And of you.

95
00:10:52,273 --> 00:10:53,662
Doesn't ring a bell.

96
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:59,663
I am informed you have come to London
to procure a crew for your ship.

97
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:01,611
Vicious rumour. Not true.

98
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:05,312
Then you lied to me when you told me
you were Jack Sparrow.

99
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:08,707
I am Jack Sparrow, but I'm not here to
procure a crew.

100
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,133
That is... someone else.

101
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:16,005
Ah... someone else named Jack Sparrow.

102
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:22,241
You brought me the wrong wastrel. Find
the proper one and dispose of this imposter.

103
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:23,947
No. Wait, wait, wait hang on a minute.

104
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:26,823
I'm Jack Sparrow the one and only.

105
00:11:26,824 --> 00:11:30,840
- And I am in London.
- To procure a crew?

106
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:33,916
- To undertake a voyage to find the fountain...
- What?

107
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:38,378
Will someone please remove these infernal
chains.

108
00:11:39,343 --> 00:11:40,664
Come come!

109
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:48,550
- We know you're in possession of a map.
- Confiscate the map and to the gallows with you.

110
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:51,336
Have you a map?

111
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:58,003
- No.
- Where is it?

112
00:11:58,004 --> 00:12:03,354
The truth. I lost it. Quite recently in fact.

113
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:09,320
I have a report the Spanish have
located the fountain of youth.

114
00:12:09,721 --> 00:12:14,759
I will not have some melancholy Spanish monarch...

115
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,706
...a Catholic, gain eternal life!

116
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:26,626
- You do know the way to the fountain?
- Course I do. Look at me!

117
00:12:26,627 --> 00:12:28,829
You can guide an expedition.

118
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:35,777
With your permission, your highnee.
You will be providing then, a ship.

119
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:42,174
- And a crew.
- And a captain.

120
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:59,030
After you, Sire.

121
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:02,993
If I may be so bold.

122
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:06,798
Why is that man not in chains? He must
be manacled at once.

123
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,081
Center of my palace? Hardly.

124
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:16,345
Hector. How nice to see a fellow pirate
make good for himself.

125
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:19,454
Pirate? No. Privateer.

126
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:25,438
On a sanctioned mission under the
authority and protection of the Crown.

127
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:31,410
As may be, but first... What has
become of my beloved Pearl?

128
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:34,947
I lost the Pearl, as I lost my leg!

129
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,100
- Lost the Pearl?
- Aye.

130
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:41,191
I defended her mightily enough. But
she sunk none the less.

131
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:51,584
If that ship be sunk properly, you should
be sunk with it.

132
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:55,054
Captain Barbossa. Each second we tarry...

133
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:57,312
The Spanish out distance us.

134
00:13:57,313 --> 00:14:00,013
I have every confidence you will prevail and...

135
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:03,011
...be rewarded with the high station
you so desire.

136
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:07,790
- To serve doth suffice, Sire.
- You, sir, are stupid.

137
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:14,094
Jack, our sands be all but run . Where's
the harm in joinin the winnin side?

138
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:18,460
And you do meet a nicer class of person.

139
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:21,020
I understand everything.

140
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:24,172
Except that wig.

141
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:13,866
- He escaped?
- Leave it to me, Sire.

142
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,029
Guards!

143
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,907
Find him!

144
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:21,903
There!

145
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:36,928
Ah!

146
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:40,453
Oh! Oh! Aah!

147
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,151
Is that it?

148
00:17:54,703 --> 00:17:57,261
Fire!

149
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:27,586
He's getting away!

150
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:45,956
Filthy pirate!

151
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,427
Hallo, Jackie!

152
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,667
Hello, Dad.

153
00:19:10,723 --> 00:19:12,920
I heard you're puttin together a crew.

154
00:19:13,598 --> 00:19:16,073
If enough people keep sayin it, it must be true.

155
00:19:16,543 --> 00:19:19,465
I heard where you're headed. The fountain.

156
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,450
Have you been there?

157
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,961
Does this face look like it's been to
the Fountain of Youth?

158
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:29,557
- Depends on the light.
- Son, the Fountain...

159
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:33,395
There'll be items required. For the
profound ritual.

160
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:35,542
Two chalices.

161
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:39,584
- On the map there was a chalice.
- Two silver...

162
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:43,207
From the Ponce de Leon ship.
You'll need both.

163
00:19:43,427 --> 00:19:46,404
- For?
- The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.

164
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:49,626
Find out every detail before you set sail.

165
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:53,517
Oh, set sail, love to. But for that I
may need a ship.

166
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:59,307
Those folk over there, they have a ship.
They're signin up sailors, right now.

167
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:07,239
One last thing, Jackie.

168
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,877
The Fountain will test you. Mark my words.

169
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,644
- I hear you be recruitin a crew.
- Aye. That is...

170
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:41,273
Jack Sparrow be puttin together a modest
venture.

171
00:20:44,398 --> 00:20:48,127
You got some nerve, aint ya? Turnin up
here dressed like that.

172
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:52,464
- What are you, some kind of an impostor?
- Do you have any idea who I am, mate?

173
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:58,609
Hey, markers. There's a bloke here whats
forgotten his own name.

174
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:05,680
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow. Who'll
buy a sailor a drink?

175
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,633
You've stolen me. And I'm here to take
meself back.

176
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,677
Stop doing that.

177
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:44,593
Only one person alive knows that move.

178
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:54,643
Always wanted to do that.

179
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:56,990
Hello Angelica.

180
00:24:00,123 --> 00:24:01,657
Hello, Jack.

181
00:24:01,658 --> 00:24:07,335
Are you impressed. I think I almost
killed you once or twice.

182
00:24:07,336 --> 00:24:10,599
I'm touched at this most sincerest form
of flattery.

183
00:24:13,122 --> 00:24:14,920
But why?

184
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:18,296
You were the only pirate I thought I
would pass for.

185
00:24:18,297 --> 00:24:20,224
That is not a compliment.

186
00:24:22,516 --> 00:24:26,265
Don't worry, Jack.
I forgave you a long time ago.

187
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:28,361
For what? For leaving you?

188
00:24:28,794 --> 00:24:31,113
I recall that I left you!

189
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:35,563
A gentleman allows a lady to maintain
her fiction.

190
00:24:35,564 --> 00:24:38,977
Look Sparrow. As long as my sailors get
their money...

191
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:42,519
...they're willing to put up with any
number of peculiarities.

192
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,122
Ah. There is one peculiarity with which I
will not put up with.

193
00:24:47,396 --> 00:24:50,645
I will be impersonated as Captain. Nothing less.

194
00:24:50,646 --> 00:24:55,354
For that you need a ship. And as it
turns out... I have one.

195
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:57,531
I could use a ship.

196
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:03,685
- I hear tell you've been to the fountain.
- There's been a lot of hear telling going on these days.

197
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:08,221
- The Fountain of Youth.
- Dearest Angelica. Fret not.

198
00:25:08,222 --> 00:25:10,931
You still have a few usable years left.

199
00:25:12,056 --> 00:25:15,056
Always so charming. But you didn't
answer me.

200
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,881
Eh? Have I gone to the fountain?
Waste of time.

201
00:25:17,606 --> 00:25:20,606
Me lady. I see un-seamen like fellows
with an officious looking nature.

202
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:29,831
Friends of yours?

203
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:32,837
I may have unintentionally slighted
some king or other.

204
00:25:34,946 --> 00:25:37,477
- You haven't changed!
- Implying the need?

205
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,571
Yes!

206
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:44,396
You betrayed me. You seduced me,
and you used me.

207
00:25:44,397 --> 00:25:46,533
I was innocent in the ways of men.

208
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:50,085
You demonstrated a lot of technique for
someone I supposedly corrupted.

209
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,916
<i>(pounding on the door) Open this door!</i>

210
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:57,905
I was ready to take my vows, and you...

211
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:03,590
- What were you doing in a Spanish convent anyway?
- I was looking for a brothel. It was a mistake.

212
00:26:08,637 --> 00:26:10,309
There!

213
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:31,014
- We are at a disadvantage.
- Speak for yourself!

214
00:26:31,015 --> 00:26:33,116
Unlike some who pretend to be...

215
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:37,106
But in fact cannot hold a candle to. I am Captain Jack Sparrow.

216
00:27:13,193 --> 00:27:15,898
Back then you said I used you...

217
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:21,163
- You know exactly how.
- I know, but how can you say it?

218
00:27:26,555 --> 00:27:29,145
- So, what is it?
- What is what?

219
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,304
About the fountain. What do you know?

220
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:42,602
You don't happen to be in possession of 2
sliver chalices instead of Ponce de León?

221
00:27:42,603 --> 00:27:45,020
- No.
- Ha! Thought not.

222
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:49,719
- Why?
- I hear stories, rumors...

223
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:53,297
You are of course aware of the ritual.

224
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,934
Yes, I am.

225
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,854
What is it? What is required?

226
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:06,595
A Mermaid, Jack.

227
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:18,566
You made a mistake!
It's a life sentence, not death!

228
00:28:18,591 --> 00:28:19,791
Life!

229
00:28:24,608 --> 00:28:30,508
- Barbossa!
- Thank you gentlemen. I trust you can tie a noose.

230
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:36,245
It's a hard thing. Forcing a man to twist
his own hangin rope.

231
00:28:36,997 --> 00:28:39,852
You must lie in the bed the way you made it.

232
00:28:41,612 --> 00:28:44,590
- What's happened to you?
- Where be Jack Sparrow?

233
00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:46,562
He escaped.

234
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:50,305
I'm on a tight schedule Gibbs. The HMS
Providence sets sail at first light.

235
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:55,048
If you didn't care to watch it hanging here
dead, with a mouth full of flies...

236
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,341
Speak now.

237
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,540
- Take me with you. Any point of the compass.
- Take you where, Gibbs?

238
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:09,442
The Fountain? Aye? Is that where Jack
be headed?

239
00:29:10,671 --> 00:29:13,272
Have ya anything you can offer me, Gibbs?

240
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:16,477
Anything at all?

241
00:29:18,094 --> 00:29:21,321
Upon my naked word, you'll not see the dawn.

242
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:31,252
Hand it over.

243
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:37,116
You fool!

244
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:41,244
I had just enough time
to study those infernal circles,

245
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,049
Every route. Every destination. All
safe. In here.

246
00:29:47,163 --> 00:29:51,312
Welcome back to his majesties Navy
Master Gibbs.

247
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,245
- Show a leg, sailor!
- Aye, sir!

248
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:10,405
What?

249
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:13,492
- There's been a horrible mistake.
- Keep moving.

250
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:18,540
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- Many a mans woken up at sea...

251
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:22,070
...no idea what, when, wherefore or why.
No memory of the night before.

252
00:30:22,105 --> 00:30:24,637
Once he signed up and drank away all
his bonus money.

253
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:29,144
No, no, no. You don't understand, mate. I'm
Captain Jack Sparrow. The original. The only.

254
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:31,859
I'm Scrum and the pleasure's all mine. Now
keep moving.

255
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:41,804
Scrum.

256
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:51,051
- Why is there a glass coffin?
- Do I look like a man in charge?

257
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,274
- Where am I?
- Excuse me, Captain Sparrow sir.

258
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:59,433
I'll be right honored to welcome you aboard a well
renowned vessel of infamy. Queen Anne's Revenge.

259
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:04,248
Blackbeard.

260
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:28,069
He's a curious one.

261
00:31:28,881 --> 00:31:31,222
- He's been zombified.
- Eh?

262
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:36,487
Zombified. Blackbeards doing. All
the officers are the same.

263
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:38,377
Makes em more compliant.

264
00:31:39,893 --> 00:31:41,673
And perpetually ill tempered.

265
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,330
- Come on, scrub.
- Yes.

266
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:55,173
<i>Pull! Pull!</i>

267
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:06,544
- Five days underway, at least.
- Aye. You can tell that by the smell of the sea?

268
00:32:08,054 --> 00:32:09,419
Smell of the crew!

269
00:32:14,118 --> 00:32:17,763
Oy. What does that poor sop do? How
can I make sure to not?

270
00:32:18,444 --> 00:32:23,073
Him? Churchly fellow. Always goin on
about the lord almighty.

271
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:27,076
- Bible thumper on this ship?
- A missionaries his story.

272
00:32:27,174 --> 00:32:32,614
What I heard was he got captured in a
raid. Rest of the ship got killed. But not him.

273
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:36,488
First mate wouldn't let it happen, on account
of his premier standing with the lord.

274
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:40,916
First mate, stickin her neck out,
for some prisoner.

275
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,121
- That, you don't see.
- Her?

276
00:32:44,972 --> 00:32:47,548
- First mate is a her?
- Back to work!

277
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:58,656
Steady as she goes.

278
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:17,853
You are a ruthless, soulless, cross-grained
cur.

279
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:21,120
- I told you I had a ship.
- No, Blackbeard has a ship.

280
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:23,540
Upon which I am now imprisoned.

281
00:33:24,596 --> 00:33:30,194
We can do this, Jack. The Fountain of Youth...
Like you always wanted.

282
00:33:31,306 --> 00:33:35,596
Blackbeard. Edward Teach. The
pirate all pirates fear.

283
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:38,512
Resurrector of the dead in his spare time.

284
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:41,631
- He will listen to me.
- He listens to no one.

285
00:33:42,191 --> 00:33:44,000
Maybe to his own daughter.

286
00:33:47,177 --> 00:33:49,992
His daughter as in, begat by?

287
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,200
Long lost, recently found...

288
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:57,881
...who loves her dear papa with all
her soul.

289
00:33:58,808 --> 00:34:01,191
- He bought that?
- I sold that!

290
00:34:08,345 --> 00:34:11,773
Then this is the fountain of youth for him.
Or, I mean you.

291
00:34:11,845 --> 00:34:15,561
- Not you and me.
- No, Jack, that's the best part.

292
00:34:15,796 --> 00:34:21,026
- He will be dead.
- Ahh. You'll be handling that part yourself then?

293
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:26,132
There is a prophecy. Maybe you don't
believe in the supernatural.

294
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:28,252
Oh no, no, no. I've seen a thing or two.

295
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:37,062
The prophecy is this: Blackbeard will meet
his death...

296
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:41,883
...within a fortnight. At the hands of
a one legged man.

297
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:44,980
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.

298
00:35:01,952 --> 00:35:05,979
Ah, Master Gibbs, storer of the map. Perhaps
you'd be so kind as to provide us a heading.

299
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:16,210
- Dear Jim, pour me a gobbler.
- Hey. We be privateers, not pirates Master Gibbs.

300
00:35:16,245 --> 00:35:21,050
- And in the kings name, we behave as such.
- Aye, Captain.

301
00:35:25,204 --> 00:35:29,997
- Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?
- Aye, it be proper.

302
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:32,485
There's your proof.

303
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:40,765
A Spaniard.

304
00:35:41,912 --> 00:35:47,804
All hands, battle stations.
Turn windward.

305
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:52,531
Move the cannons!

306
00:35:56,757 --> 00:35:58,764
Gunners take balls.

307
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:05,183
Await orders.

308
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:08,656
Ready!

309
00:36:09,262 --> 00:36:11,012
Guns armed, awaiting orders sir.

310
00:36:17,672 --> 00:36:21,132
Sir, orders? Sir?

311
00:36:27,295 --> 00:36:30,463
Never so much as turned his head.
The fountain is the prize.

312
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:35,170
It appears we be not even worth the time
it would take to sink us.

313
00:36:35,205 --> 00:36:39,455
And now we've fallen behind. All hands
make more sail.

314
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,188
All hands more sail!

315
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:46,076
- Weigh hard me wind. We need a tide.

316
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:58,059
The topic gentlemen, is mutiny.

317
00:36:58,185 --> 00:37:00,185
Mutiny most foul.

318
00:37:01,104 --> 00:37:04,246
Aye. I signed up to sail under Jack Sparrow.
Not some pretender.

319
00:37:04,281 --> 00:37:05,881
And a lady at that.

320
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:10,094
- A mention was failed to be made to this uncanny crew.
- Made my toes curl, it do.

321
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:14,770
- I got em. All of them.
- Well done!

322
00:37:15,325 --> 00:37:19,626
On to it then. Blackbeard. What are his habits?

323
00:37:19,661 --> 00:37:22,467
- Stays most in his cabin.
- That's right. My lady crews cabin.

324
00:37:23,968 --> 00:37:26,783
- Yes, but when he comes out.
- Don't really come out.

325
00:37:29,095 --> 00:37:34,417
- Must come out some time!
- Not really, no. Ain't seen him. Never.

326
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:38,727
- Any of you sailed with him before?
- No, never.

327
00:37:39,764 --> 00:37:44,201
- Any of you seen him before?
- Not really, no.

328
00:37:45,383 --> 00:37:49,274
Stays in his cabin. No ones sailed with
him, seen him.

329
00:37:50,163 --> 00:37:53,555
Good news, gentlemen!
This is not Blackbeard's ship.

330
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:57,441
- This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.
- This be the Queen Anne's Revenge right enough.

331
00:37:57,932 --> 00:38:01,937
- How do you know?
- I seen the name, on the back of the ship.

332
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:10,934
Gentlemen, sailors, fellow conscriptees.

333
00:38:12,252 --> 00:38:14,754
You have been monstrously deceived.

334
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:17,555
- We are decepted then!
- Yes.

335
00:38:18,711 --> 00:38:21,497
You've nay been informed of the destination.

336
00:38:21,683 --> 00:38:27,607
Death lies before us, as we sail... for
the Fountain of Youth.

337
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:34,413
- Might be a sorry fate, mates.
- For certain.

338
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:41,709
Unless. We take the ship.

339
00:38:44,046 --> 00:38:46,959
We take the ship then. Now!

340
00:38:52,043 --> 00:38:53,425
Go on then.

341
00:39:20,547 --> 00:39:21,976
Jack...

342
00:39:23,536 --> 00:39:28,284
If this is a dream, you can keep the
sword and boots on.

343
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:32,918
- If it's not...
- It's a dream!

344
00:39:38,594 --> 00:39:40,368
No it's not.

345
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:43,602
I thought I should give you fair warning.
We're taking the ship.

346
00:39:43,627 --> 00:39:45,627
- <i>(yelling in Spanish?)</i>
- Nothing personal!

347
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,703
Stay out of it.

348
00:40:15,618 --> 00:40:16,979
??

349
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,754
You're either with us or against us!

350
00:41:10,755 --> 00:41:12,944
I'm not with you. Neither am I against you!

351
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,778
- Can he do that?
- He's religious. I believe it's required.

352
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:26,015
Fight to the bitter end you cack-headed jackeye??

353
00:41:37,755 --> 00:41:40,298
Take him men and tie him down tight.

354
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:56,494
The ship is ours!

355
00:42:25,547 --> 00:42:26,997
Gentlemen.

356
00:42:35,187 --> 00:42:38,066
I be placed in a bewilderment.

357
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:42,197
There I were... resting...

358
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,449
And upon a sudden, I hear an ungodly row on deck.

359
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:55,606
Sailors abandon their posts without
orders and without leave.

360
00:42:57,095 --> 00:43:02,734
Men before the mast. Taking the ship
for themselves.

361
00:43:04,743 --> 00:43:06,806
Would be that mutiny, mate?

362
00:43:07,021 --> 00:43:08,568
Mutiny, Captain!

363
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:11,019
- Again?
- Mutiny!

364
00:43:11,053 --> 00:43:14,827
Aye, mutiny.

365
00:43:17,745 --> 00:43:21,334
And what fate befalls mutineers?

366
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:24,578
Now we know the answer to that, do we not.

367
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:26,422
Mutineers...

368
00:43:26,822 --> 00:43:28,710
Hang!

369
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:19,969
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.

370
00:44:21,268 --> 00:44:24,579
- I can name fingers and point names.
- No need, Mr. Sparrow.

371
00:44:24,614 --> 00:44:27,680
They are sheep, you their shepherd.

372
00:44:32,972 --> 00:44:35,889
Have I mentioned sir, what a lovely
daughter you have.

373
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:39,071
A pitying last sight for a doomed soul.

374
00:44:39,106 --> 00:44:40,778
Forgive me father. We need him.

375
00:44:40,813 --> 00:44:44,251
If I don't kill a man every now and then,
they forget who I am.

376
00:44:44,285 --> 00:44:45,818
- Coward!
- Hmm?

377
00:44:47,193 --> 00:44:52,749
They do not forget. Your crew sees you for
the miscreant you are.

378
00:44:52,784 --> 00:44:54,091
A coward, no matter how many you slay.

379
00:44:54,204 --> 00:44:56,541
Twice in one day, I find myself in
a bewilderment.

380
00:44:56,576 --> 00:44:58,626
You are not bewildered. You are afraid.

381
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,883
You do not walk the path of righteousness
the way of the light.

382
00:45:02,918 --> 00:45:08,493
No, sir, the truth is it be much simpler
than all that. I'm a bad man.

383
00:45:09,323 --> 00:45:10,733
That too.

384
00:45:10,768 --> 00:45:13,321
- I might have to kill you too, catechist
- No!

385
00:45:13,356 --> 00:45:16,514
- All Latin blood, like her mother.
- Father, I beg you!

386
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:20,732
Ah, there I be again. Forgetting why
the missionary is here.

387
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:25,121
My daughter, fears for my soul, or what's
left of it.

388
00:45:26,776 --> 00:45:29,752
You truly wish to save me, my child?

389
00:45:30,523 --> 00:45:32,592
Every soul can be saved.

390
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,457
- Is that true, young clergy?
- Yes.

391
00:45:37,058 --> 00:45:39,296
Though you I see as a bit of a long shot.

392
00:45:40,455 --> 00:45:44,326
Still I pray for every unfortunate soul
on this hell-bound vessel.

393
00:45:47,138 --> 00:45:49,690
You disarm me with your faith.

394
00:45:51,222 --> 00:45:54,367
Eight bells. Which of you unfortunate
souls stood watch?

395
00:45:55,502 --> 00:46:02,068
- I did. I stood watch.
- Hmm Hmm. Gunner?

396
00:46:05,692 --> 00:46:08,891
- You?
- Aye.

397
00:46:10,655 --> 00:46:15,436
Aye. The cook. Perfect.

398
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:17,532
Row the long boat.

399
00:46:22,502 --> 00:46:24,134
Bring her about.

400
00:46:35,517 --> 00:46:38,881
- Why do you do this?
- Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

401
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:41,580
Our laws allow the captain to show leniency.

402
00:46:41,415 --> 00:46:44,052
I've given this man a chance to
determine his fate.

403
00:46:44,087 --> 00:46:45,751
A gift not afforded to all.

404
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:00,531
A chance to show the worth of your prayers.

405
00:47:00,566 --> 00:47:04,436
Pray he be delivered from... evil?

406
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,312
Port speed.

407
00:47:14,347 --> 00:47:16,612
Give that man a chance! Give yourself
a chance!

408
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,195
You know when I feel closest to our maker?

409
00:47:44,256 --> 00:47:49,073
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.
That's when the true desire of his will is revealed.

410
00:47:49,108 --> 00:47:52,637
And I see it revealed when in times of hardship
and tragedy...

411
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:55,106
...kindness and compassion are shown
to those in need.

412
00:47:55,141 --> 00:47:57,856
Perhaps you should pray for him to be
unharmed, yeah?

413
00:47:57,891 --> 00:48:00,007
- Please, there's still hope.
- Again!

414
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:15,595
I actually have no interest in the fountain
whatsoever, so...

415
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:20,163
...if your heart is set, you may drop
me off anywhere you like.

416
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:22,017
That'll be all, quarter master.

417
00:48:24,671 --> 00:48:28,322
Your words surround you like fog. Make
you hard to see.

418
00:48:28,357 --> 00:48:31,032
And what of you, the mighty Blackbeard?

419
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:33,537
Beheaded, they say.

420
00:48:34,024 --> 00:48:37,952
Still your body swam three times
around your ship and climbed back on board.

421
00:48:38,587 --> 00:48:41,404
And here you are, running scared.

422
00:48:41,775 --> 00:48:44,808
- Scared?
- To the fountain.

423
00:48:45,428 --> 00:48:48,397
The quarter master sees things before
they happen.

424
00:48:48,652 --> 00:48:52,500
He has foreseen my death. And so the
fates have spoken.

425
00:48:53,325 --> 00:48:55,440
The threads of destiny, woven.

426
00:48:55,744 --> 00:48:58,388
You have a ridiculously high regard for fate.

427
00:48:58,565 --> 00:49:00,247
- Fate. And you?
- Me?

428
00:49:00,779 --> 00:49:04,444
I'm skeptical of predicting any future
which includes me.

429
00:49:04,479 --> 00:49:10,380
It'd be foolish to battle fate. But I'd be
tempted to cheat it.

430
00:49:11,137 --> 00:49:13,971
I will reach the fountain. You will lead me.

431
00:49:16,104 --> 00:49:19,864
That knife will serve you no better
than the mutiny you devised.

432
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:24,121
Mutiny served me well. It gained me an
audience with you.

433
00:49:26,413 --> 00:49:27,605
Aye.

434
00:49:28,753 --> 00:49:30,242
To warn you.

435
00:49:31,439 --> 00:49:35,393
Regarding your first mate. Who pretends
to be persons she is not.

436
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:38,203
Do tell.

437
00:49:39,693 --> 00:49:41,907
She is not your daughter.

438
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,232
<i>Yes, she has my flesh and blood</i>

439
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:52,965
Sir. The woman is consummate in the art
of deception.

440
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,756
I know, as I mostly unwittingly, set
her on her wicked path.

441
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:02,461
Though I cannot claim credit for her
existing abundance of natural talent.

442
00:50:04,528 --> 00:50:09,639
Angelica. My beloved daughter. The one
true good thing I've done in this life.

443
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:12,791
And you claim to be the one who corrupted her?

444
00:50:12,955 --> 00:50:16,546
Sir. What she is, is pure evil.

445
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:22,828
More to be feared than a wild beast. Hungry
wild beast, with gnashing teeth.

446
00:50:23,272 --> 00:50:26,154
Vengeful hungry from Hell beast...

447
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,138
- Father!
- Sweetness!

448
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:33,193
No need to hurt him father. He will help us.

449
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:35,085
Won't you, Jack?

450
00:50:35,364 --> 00:50:39,266
You see, even now she tends to your welfare.

451
00:50:39,301 --> 00:50:42,068
Giving lie to the claims you make of her.

452
00:50:49,826 --> 00:50:54,253
You will lead us to the fountain! Yes?

453
00:50:55,178 --> 00:51:00,956
Put another way. If I, do not make it
to the fountain in time...

454
00:51:03,071 --> 00:51:05,471
Neither will you.

455
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:10,956
I'll have a wee look see at those charts
right away. Shall I?

456
00:51:16,468 --> 00:51:17,579
Sir.

457
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:21,697
Aye.

458
00:51:21,723 --> 00:51:25,291
Captain, sir. I am unhappy to report
rumors, sir among the crew...

459
00:51:25,526 --> 00:51:28,229
...as to our destination.

460
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,782
Shut your trap and make way.

461
00:51:35,322 --> 00:51:38,088
- That's the way of it then?
- No disrespect, sir.

462
00:51:39,441 --> 00:51:42,251
What do the men fear? Say it! Speak
the words!

463
00:51:42,846 --> 00:51:47,517
- Whitecap Bay.
- Aye, Whitecap Bay.

464
00:51:47,552 --> 00:51:51,709
And every worthless seaman fears the
name. And rightly so.

465
00:51:51,744 --> 00:51:54,574
Though few know why or dare to ask.

466
00:51:54,609 --> 00:51:56,070
Be the stories true?

467
00:51:56,105 --> 00:52:01,222
Say what robs you of your staunch heart, Gibbs,
or forever leave it to wilder fears of fantasy.

468
00:52:03,773 --> 00:52:07,739
- Mermaids, Captain.
- Aye, mermaids.

469
00:52:07,774 --> 00:52:12,079
Sea ghouls. Devil fish. Dreadful in hunger
for flesh of man.

470
00:52:12,114 --> 00:52:15,187
Mermaid waters. That we'll pass.

471
00:52:15,647 --> 00:52:20,332
Cling to your soul Gibbs, if mermaids
be given to take the rest.

472
00:52:21,154 --> 00:52:22,679
To the bone.

473
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,432
Steady! Steady men! Find your courage.

474
00:52:27,467 --> 00:52:29,602
- Or be ready to purpose your fear.
- Save yourselves!

475
00:52:34,572 --> 00:52:37,497
- Man overboard!
- Nay, a deserter!

476
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:38,967
- Come about!
- Nay!

477
00:52:40,385 --> 00:52:45,288
Gentlemen, I shall not ask any more of any
man than what that man can deliver.

478
00:52:45,422 --> 00:52:48,671
But I do ask this. Are we not kings men?

479
00:52:49,006 --> 00:52:53,246
- Aye.
- On the kings mission?

480
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:57,668
I did not notice any fear in the eyes of
the Spanish as they passed us by.

481
00:52:57,859 --> 00:53:00,637
- Are we not kings men?
- Aye!

482
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:05,731
Hands aloft and bear away. Stay on ahead
to Whitecap Bay.

483
00:53:21,045 --> 00:53:22,558
<i>Hola.</i>

484
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:29,529
- Come, little drink.
- Wine, music, candle light...

485
00:53:30,193 --> 00:53:33,116
I think we've traveled down this road
before, Jack.

486
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,383
Yes, we have.

487
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:37,034
I remember it well.

488
00:53:38,776 --> 00:53:45,866
Winding, twisting, turning, gyrating,
writhing... incessant writhing.

489
00:53:46,214 --> 00:53:48,117
You recall Saint Dominic?

490
00:53:48,783 --> 00:53:53,100
La Martinique. I tried to kill you
in St. Dominique.

491
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:54,987
??

492
00:53:55,464 --> 00:53:58,005
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.

493
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,965
Was I the first? I've often wondered.

494
00:54:01,894 --> 00:54:04,847
You can be so charming when you want
something, Jack.

495
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,551
The trick is finding out what.

496
00:54:09,154 --> 00:54:10,826
Truth, then, at least.

497
00:54:11,784 --> 00:54:17,046
Blackbeard has served his purpose, you
and I can go to the fountain together.

498
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:22,300
Where we shall bath one another in equal shares
of fame and other assorted debaucheries.

499
00:54:22,497 --> 00:54:25,593
And I tell you the ritual of the fountain.

500
00:54:25,628 --> 00:54:28,006
Yes, the profane ritual.

501
00:54:31,045 --> 00:54:32,693
Can I trust you, Jack?

502
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:35,285
I need you on this side.

503
00:54:35,535 --> 00:54:37,638
Ah my dearest Angelica.

504
00:54:37,673 --> 00:54:41,088
You and I are as thick as thieves as love.

505
00:54:41,089 --> 00:54:43,565
Tell me the rules.

506
00:54:45,756 --> 00:54:49,585
Water from the fountain of youth...

507
00:54:51,268 --> 00:54:54,503
The simmering tear of a mermaid.

508
00:54:55,352 --> 00:54:58,507
- The silver chalices of Ponce de Leon.
- Uh huh.

509
00:54:59,985 --> 00:55:02,895
- With these items...
- Yes?

510
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:07,507
With these items, you may take all
the years of life from another.

511
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:11,404
- Eh?
- You know what this means?

512
00:55:11,759 --> 00:55:13,903
We cannot go alone, you and I.

513
00:55:14,867 --> 00:55:17,109
The ritual requires a victim.

514
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,357
- That is unfortunate.
- That's love.

515
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,672
I find my desire for the Fountain greatly
lessened.

516
00:55:27,582 --> 00:55:30,915
But there is something on board you do want.

517
00:55:36,354 --> 00:55:37,836
What about Blackbeard?

518
00:55:37,871 --> 00:55:41,255
He's in the chart room. We have to be quick.

519
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,132
He keeps each ship as a prize.

520
00:55:54,962 --> 00:55:59,634
You help me, and I promise you
your pick.

521
00:55:59,669 --> 00:56:02,965
Though I think I know the one you will chose.

522
00:56:09,512 --> 00:56:10,518
The Black Pearl in a bottle?

523
00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:14,128
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?

524
00:56:18,984 --> 00:56:21,266
That's even more annoying in miniature.

525
00:56:22,122 --> 00:56:25,242
- Do we have a deal, Jack?
- Angelica, I know you.

526
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:29,793
You are not going to steal the life of some innocent man.

527
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,559
What about the one taking one.

528
00:56:34,909 --> 00:56:39,425
I need years, Jack. Not for me.

529
00:56:40,748 --> 00:56:42,092
For my father.

530
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,712
I am, truly the daughter of Blackbeard.

531
00:56:47,226 --> 00:56:51,998
- You've fallen for you own con.
- No, he is my father.

532
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,739
The lies I told you were not lies.

533
00:56:55,903 --> 00:56:59,431
- You lied to me by telling me the truth?
- Yes.

534
00:57:00,074 --> 00:57:02,196
That's very good. May I use that?

535
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:05,227
- I'm sure you will anyway.
- Of course I will.

536
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,281
So will you not give up this quest?

537
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:12,559
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.

538
00:57:13,552 --> 00:57:16,861
Angelica...
Your father, Blackbeard...

539
00:57:18,682 --> 00:57:22,628
He is evil and he will kill you. Given
the chance.

540
00:57:22,663 --> 00:57:24,050
He cannot be saved.

541
00:57:24,614 --> 00:57:27,624
And who are you to set the limits on
redemption?

542
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:31,229
You stole years of my life, Jack. You owe me.

543
00:57:31,672 --> 00:57:34,558
And you are en-route to getting yourself
killed.

544
00:57:34,593 --> 00:57:37,384
And I am not inclined to stand by and watch.

545
00:57:37,409 --> 00:57:39,109
<i>Whitecap Bay!</i>

546
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:49,018
All hands on deck. Take to the long boat.

547
00:57:53,414 --> 00:57:56,010
Lay em out flat. No tangles.

548
00:57:56,293 --> 00:57:59,184
Make em look pretty for out dainty guest.

549
00:57:59,655 --> 00:58:03,494
We're gonna need light. A lot of light.

550
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:06,634
Come!

551
00:58:27,765 --> 00:58:33,273
Smell that? Whale oil. Stuff burns like
a miracle from god.

552
00:58:33,422 --> 00:58:35,124
Can you make it work?

553
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:38,902
It's made by the English. Let's not
get our hopes up.

554
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:53,327
?? moon in the ?? of the new one. The
rest of the summer.

555
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:56,785
Perfect for hunting a mermaids tears.

556
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:13,212
- We're doomed. They be drawn to man made light.

557
00:59:13,247 --> 00:59:14,472
Sharks!

558
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:16,244
Worse than sharks, boy.

559
00:59:16,279 --> 00:59:20,175
There'll be mermaids upon us within the
hour. You mark my words.

560
00:59:20,209 --> 00:59:22,194
And we're the bait.

561
00:59:26,923 --> 00:59:30,420
I heard it said that the kiss from a
mermaid can save a sailor from drowning.

562
00:59:30,455 --> 00:59:32,035
Don't be a fool.

563
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:36,909
Mermaids are all female son, and lovely
as the dream of heaven.

564
00:59:37,024 --> 00:59:41,169
But when it comes time to churn butter,
so to speak...

565
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:46,925
They snatch a sailor out of a boat, or
off the deck of a ship. Have their way.

566
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,937
Then the sailors are pulled to bottom.
And drowned. Aint it?

567
00:59:52,591 --> 00:59:56,180
Sometimes, the other way around.

568
00:59:57,571 --> 00:59:59,816
- Sing.
- What?

569
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:03,244
They like to 'ear singing.

570
01:00:08,169 --> 01:00:14,669
<i>(singing)</i>

571
01:00:14,786 --> 01:00:16,010
Louder!

572
01:00:16,135 --> 01:00:29,535
<i>(continues singing louder)</i>

573
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:36,560
<i>(all join in singing)</i>

574
01:00:39,685 --> 01:00:52,285
<i>(singing faintly)</i>

575
01:01:09,701 --> 01:01:11,506
Lord save me.

576
01:01:15,034 --> 01:01:17,397
No look... look there.

577
01:01:18,991 --> 01:01:21,923
- You'll scare her off!
- Aye, and good riddance!

578
01:01:27,057 --> 01:01:28,345
Can you talk?

579
01:01:30,362 --> 01:01:32,110
Yes.

580
01:01:39,704 --> 01:01:41,463
You're beautiful.

581
01:01:42,036 --> 01:01:46,025
- Are you the one who sings?
- Aye.

582
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:51,501
Are you my jolly sailor bold?

583
01:01:53,533 --> 01:01:55,192
Aye, that I'll be.

584
01:01:55,227 --> 01:01:56,278
Scrum. Comport yourself.

585
01:01:57,118 --> 01:02:01,646
Boys. There ain't much been given to me in
my brief, miserable life. There's a truth in it.

586
01:02:01,781 --> 01:02:08,234
But by god. I'll have it said that Scrum had
himself a kiss from a proper mermaid!

587
01:02:09,459 --> 01:03:18,259
<i>(Tamara singing)</i>

588
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:55,457
Out upon it. It has begun!

589
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:40,632
- Light em up.
- Master your courage.

590
01:04:40,657 --> 01:04:42,857
Drive em to shore!

591
01:04:54,411 --> 01:04:57,665
Netting to the water!
Quickly!

592
01:05:47,124 --> 01:05:49,775
Retreat all to land. For you lives.

593
01:05:53,677 --> 01:05:55,024
Retreat, I say!

594
01:05:55,253 --> 01:05:57,859
Cowards! Back in the water!

595
01:05:57,894 --> 01:06:01,293
There'll be no refuge on land. Upon my word.

596
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:35,859
Come on!

597
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,860
We got one!

598
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,240
I'm in love!

599
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,770
Take the wounded. See if you can
find one mermaid still alive.

600
01:09:05,237 --> 01:09:06,408
Come give a hand.

601
01:09:07,146 --> 01:09:08,776
Well done, sailor.

602
01:09:10,289 --> 01:09:14,027
Did everyone see that? Cause I will not
be doing it again.

603
01:09:14,062 --> 01:09:18,298
Back to the ship. We head for protected
cove. Now.

604
01:09:35,428 --> 01:09:38,139
- Ooh. Is that...
- Mermaid.

605
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:41,768
- Give up this madness now.
- I cannot.

606
01:09:42,758 --> 01:09:46,614
Ever walk on the beach, look back and
see your footsteps in the sand?

607
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:50,123
It's like that, except the footsteps
lie before me.

608
01:09:50,641 --> 01:09:54,562
- A footstep, actually.
- Whitecap Bay sir?

609
01:09:54,563 --> 01:09:55,775
We must hasten.

610
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:07,737
We travel by foot. Gibbs, I require
a heading.

611
01:10:07,772 --> 01:10:10,856
- But, sir, the men.
- They be dead already.

612
01:10:11,557 --> 01:10:15,012
- But the sound, dammit.
- Is that so?

613
01:10:15,047 --> 01:10:18,702
But I hear nothing but seagulls nesting.

614
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,893
What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?

615
01:10:24,203 --> 01:10:29,005
Seagulls... nesting. Nothing more.

616
01:10:29,468 --> 01:10:31,485
Heading, Gibbs?

617
01:10:39,619 --> 01:10:40,833
My God.

618
01:10:41,658 --> 01:10:45,058
Your head, or me heading. I'll have me one
or t'other. I don't care which.

619
01:10:50,987 --> 01:10:53,008
All hands fore-ward!

620
01:11:08,746 --> 01:11:13,260
- It's up to you now, Sparrow.
- Was that really necessary?

621
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:17,181
Best you not know the exact whereabouts of
my ship. I be a cautious man.

622
01:11:18,129 --> 01:11:19,900
So be I.

623
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:23,495
What I want first.

624
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,720
Is Ponce De Leon's ship.

625
01:12:05,347 --> 01:12:09,747
- Why is it we've got to bring her along?
- Because tears don't keep. We need them fresh.

626
01:12:10,061 --> 01:12:12,084
What was the ritual, again?

627
01:12:13,346 --> 01:12:15,968
Water from the fountain and a mermaids tear?

628
01:12:16,003 --> 01:12:19,789
And two silver chalices. One cup
with a tear, one without.

629
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,750
So one with a tear and water in both.

630
01:12:23,785 --> 01:12:25,531
Quite complicated, is it not?

631
01:12:25,566 --> 01:12:28,932
Both get water. One gets a tear.

632
01:12:28,967 --> 01:12:34,076
The person who drinks the water with the
tear gets all the years of life from the other.

633
01:12:35,064 --> 01:12:36,708
How many years?

634
01:12:39,061 --> 01:12:43,624
All the years that they have lived.
And they could have lived.

635
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:46,193
If fate had been kinder.

636
01:12:55,634 --> 01:13:00,688
Clergyman. On the off chance that this
is not their will for me...

637
01:13:01,123 --> 01:13:05,534
I would like it noted, here and now, that I am
fully prepared to believe in whatever I must.

638
01:13:06,105 --> 01:13:09,233
So that I may be welcomed into that place
where all the goodie goodies get to go.

639
01:13:10,071 --> 01:13:12,273
- Savvy?
- We have a word for that, Jack.

640
01:13:12,465 --> 01:13:16,265
- You can convert.
- I was thinking more of an as needed basis.

641
01:13:20,993 --> 01:13:23,586
- Quarter master.
- Aye.

642
01:13:23,611 --> 01:13:24,520
She cannot breathe.

643
01:13:24,521 --> 01:13:27,053
- She has water.
- She needs air!

644
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:33,860
- Open this.
- She will escape.

645
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:37,127
- You're killing her.
- I support the missionaries position.

646
01:13:45,816 --> 01:13:47,243
See?

647
01:13:51,949 --> 01:13:53,479
Onward!

648
01:14:18,069 --> 01:14:21,533
Just as I thought. Not this way.

649
01:14:23,624 --> 01:14:27,480
- This is the way, isn't it?
- Of course it is. But we should go around to the east.

650
01:14:27,515 --> 01:14:30,084
That would take us out of the path of
the chalices.

651
01:14:30,369 --> 01:14:31,804
- Well then we'll chuckle back.
- There's no time.

652
01:14:31,839 --> 01:14:34,981
- You're the one insisted on bringing the bloody mermaid.
- Well the mutiny didn't help.

653
01:14:35,016 --> 01:14:36,491
- You walk like a girl.
- You would know.

654
01:14:36,526 --> 01:14:37,887
Someone must go.

655
01:14:39,002 --> 01:14:41,691
- You mean, split up?
- You mean, jump?

656
01:14:41,725 --> 01:14:43,300
This I cannot wait to see.

657
01:14:43,684 --> 01:14:45,309
Sparrow will go.

658
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:49,552
- Find the ship. Retrieve the chalices.
- Sparrow? What makes you think he will come back?

659
01:14:49,899 --> 01:14:52,598
Yes, what makes you think he will come back?

660
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,996
We cannot trust him, father. I'll go.

661
01:14:56,267 --> 01:14:57,482
She'll go.

662
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:05,420
How much farther to the fountain? I'm
running out of time.

663
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:12,924
About a days march north, following that
river, we'll get to a series of pools.

664
01:15:12,949 --> 01:15:15,049
Then you're close.

665
01:15:15,451 --> 01:15:17,481
You will go.

666
01:15:20,104 --> 01:15:21,939
I was sure it would come to this.

667
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:39,604
You know that feeling you get sometimes
when you're standing in a high place?

668
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:42,028
Sudden urge to jump?

669
01:15:43,978 --> 01:15:45,431
I don't have it.

670
01:15:46,795 --> 01:15:49,466
- I need those chalices.
- Shoot.

671
01:15:49,501 --> 01:15:51,195
Save me the bother of the fall.

672
01:15:51,229 --> 01:15:57,919
You will go. You will return. Or I will
kill her.

673
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:03,236
- You won't kill your own daughter.
- Quarter master.

674
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:06,791
Get me six more pistols and remove
the shot from all but two.

675
01:16:06,826 --> 01:16:09,009
But do not tell me which two.

676
01:16:11,284 --> 01:16:13,732
You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.

677
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:17,993
That one... that one... No...

678
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,397
Yes.

679
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:28,257
- You're sure?
- Of course I am.

680
01:16:37,172 --> 01:16:38,249
Again.

681
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:41,496
Please. They're not even loaded.

682
01:16:47,099 --> 01:16:48,547
Again.

683
01:16:48,853 --> 01:16:52,731
If you're so keen on killing her, why
don't you just let her jump?

684
01:16:52,766 --> 01:16:53,884
What?

685
01:16:53,919 --> 01:16:59,020
If you jump and die, then she will have
her chance.

686
01:17:00,456 --> 01:17:01,895
Again?

687
01:17:05,312 --> 01:17:11,050
Oy... If I jump... will I survive?

688
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:18,431
The doll! Thank you.

689
01:17:18,756 --> 01:17:24,756
<i>(chanting incantation in foreign tongue)</i>

690
01:17:24,781 --> 01:17:27,681
<i>(Jack screaming )</i>

691
01:17:31,302 --> 01:17:33,689
Yes, now you will survive.

692
01:17:34,017 --> 01:17:35,862
This is nonsense! I'm going!

693
01:17:55,623 --> 01:17:58,627
Wet. Wet again.

694
01:18:00,252 --> 01:18:02,252
We go on. Due north. To the fountain.

695
01:18:04,618 --> 01:18:06,059
Well played, father.

696
01:18:08,043 --> 01:18:10,018
You knew which guns were loaded, right?

697
01:18:12,807 --> 01:18:14,669
Of course, my love.

698
01:18:24,094 --> 01:18:28,394
Be nice to have a map about now. Or
a ship.

699
01:18:29,519 --> 01:18:32,519
Stop. Hold very still.

700
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:37,545
You dare not let it touch your skin.

701
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:52,345
What? What be wrong with an old man havin a hobby.
What are you stopping for, eh? Push on!

702
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:56,353
- Push on.
- You'll sleep when you're dead. Push on!

703
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,109
Fortune continues to favor us.

704
01:19:28,611 --> 01:19:30,297
The Santiago.

705
01:19:30,942 --> 01:19:33,604
Famously captained by Ponce de León.

706
01:19:34,449 --> 01:19:37,528
Oh. There's no one there.

707
01:19:37,834 --> 01:19:38,973
Right then.

708
01:20:14,635 --> 01:20:16,642
We must not stop.

709
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:25,627
You will walk.

710
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:46,493
I cannot.

711
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,435
Walk or die.

712
01:20:55,215 --> 01:20:58,705
- Put your arms around me.
- I do not ask for help.

713
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:00,388
But you need it.

714
01:21:17,149 --> 01:21:18,751
We're in a hurry, yes?

715
01:21:19,266 --> 01:21:21,564
Do not fall behind.

716
01:21:40,519 --> 01:21:42,248
Wait here until I say.

717
01:21:55,307 --> 01:21:56,827
Such beauty...

718
01:21:57,819 --> 01:22:00,145
Surely you're one of God's own creations.

719
01:22:00,926 --> 01:22:05,720
And not a descendant of those dark creatures
who found no refuge on the ark.

720
01:22:08,551 --> 01:22:10,683
Such beauty.

721
01:22:12,304 --> 01:22:13,740
And yet deadly.

722
01:22:14,641 --> 01:22:18,374
- Deadly? No.
- You attacked me.

723
01:22:19,013 --> 01:22:23,538
No. You are different.

724
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:27,117
- Different?
- Are you not?

725
01:22:27,991 --> 01:22:29,724
You protect.

726
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:38,322
You pushed me down out of the way.

727
01:22:40,071 --> 01:22:44,023
- You see the Fountain?
- No, but we are close.

728
01:22:44,734 --> 01:22:48,448
- Bring the creature. Cover its head.
- She has a name!

729
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:54,727
Pray tell.

730
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:02,704
She's Syrena.

731
01:23:43,566 --> 01:23:45,220
Ponce de León.

732
01:23:48,886 --> 01:23:52,599
If 40 pirates dreamt 40 nights of treasure.

733
01:23:52,634 --> 01:23:56,294
It would not match the contents of this room.

734
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:58,151
You.

735
01:24:00,677 --> 01:24:01,559
You.

736
01:24:04,555 --> 01:24:05,897
- No. You!
- I was here first.

737
01:24:05,931 --> 01:24:08,434
You, why are you here?

738
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:11,223
Blackbeard sent me. Why are you?

739
01:24:11,258 --> 01:24:14,641
Silver chalices for my royal liege.

740
01:24:15,024 --> 01:24:16,348
Oh please.

741
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:23,439
Back, back. We have to balance it out.
The whole ship will slide.

742
01:24:27,207 --> 01:24:28,500
Right then.

743
01:24:29,372 --> 01:24:35,199
What if... we each choose an item of
approximately equal weight.

744
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:39,611
Put it back!

745
01:24:40,717 --> 01:24:42,610
We touch, nothing.

746
01:24:50,907 --> 01:24:53,728
- What about that?
- The chalices?

747
01:24:56,476 --> 01:24:59,148
- Oy. Why do you get to look first!
- Fine then.

748
01:25:18,272 --> 01:25:19,621
- Together.
- Together.

749
01:25:22,769 --> 01:25:24,011
Rocks.

750
01:25:25,024 --> 01:25:28,551
- The Spanish.
- They're ahead of us, mate.

751
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,998
I shall have a look at that map. If
it's what I fear.

752
01:25:42,803 --> 01:25:45,446
I wonder why they left this behind?

753
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:55,717
- <i>(whispers) don't touch the map!</i>
- Oh!

754
01:25:57,122 --> 01:26:02,160
They know the path. But I can also see
where they'll most likely make camp.

755
01:26:15,731 --> 01:26:16,687
- Jack!
- Ssh!

756
01:26:20,107 --> 01:26:21,269
Gibbs!

757
01:26:21,304 --> 01:26:23,787
I was just on me way to break you
out of jail.

758
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:27,720
You stole my map.

759
01:26:29,078 --> 01:26:33,790
- Right. Let's be started.
- Ole.

760
01:26:53,603 --> 01:26:55,213
Mermaids.

761
01:26:58,133 --> 01:27:00,745
Careful, these pools run deep.

762
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:02,770
If she escapes, all is lost.

763
01:27:02,795 --> 01:27:03,995
Quarter master.

764
01:27:06,323 --> 01:27:07,526
Look.

765
01:27:08,451 --> 01:27:09,989
Look!

766
01:27:10,894 --> 01:27:14,772
Staked out to die. Dry in the sun.

767
01:27:14,807 --> 01:27:17,832
Only half in the water. Not
enough to live...

768
01:27:17,867 --> 01:27:22,162
...but just enough to make the dying slow.

769
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:27,597
Think on it. Your people murdered.
Harvested for their tears.

770
01:27:28,361 --> 01:27:32,768
Syrena. Won't you cry?

771
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:36,827
All die, even you. Soon I hear.

772
01:27:37,142 --> 01:27:38,799
Listen.

773
01:27:40,716 --> 01:27:45,737
Listen! Can you not hear your sisters scream?

774
01:27:46,444 --> 01:27:51,888
Do you not hear them? We need
but one tear.

775
01:27:55,219 --> 01:27:58,636
- Vile creature.
- Chop off her fingers one by one!

776
01:27:58,671 --> 01:28:01,233
- Choke her!
- Cut out her tears from behind the eyes!

777
01:28:02,253 --> 01:28:03,953
Where's your voice in this?

778
01:28:04,381 --> 01:28:07,677
At least you'll have a change of heart,
when the sun rises.

779
01:28:07,712 --> 01:28:11,413
Aye. She will burn. But I cannot wait
for the sun.

780
01:28:11,448 --> 01:28:13,686
- Perhaps we should build a fire.
- No!

781
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:15,134
Do not contest me, cleric!

782
01:28:15,751 --> 01:28:18,735
- You will not torture her!
- We need only one tear!

783
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:22,231
I will tear every scale from her body,
one by one if I see fit.

784
01:28:22,266 --> 01:28:23,851
If that displeases you, go pray.

785
01:28:23,886 --> 01:28:27,204
I was wrong. Not every soul can be
saved. Yours cannot.

786
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:29,897
Behold gentlemen. A man formerly of faith.

787
01:28:29,932 --> 01:28:32,859
That vile creature, as you called her, is
worth a 100 of you.

788
01:28:32,894 --> 01:28:38,732
Do you care for her? You fancy her!

789
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:46,430
Do not deny what is clear to my eyes. The
question is...

790
01:28:49,251 --> 01:28:51,525
Does she fancy you?

791
01:28:53,643 --> 01:28:57,619
My god, she does. We are in luck.

792
01:28:58,507 --> 01:29:04,227
Bring forth a tear. Or witness the death
of this poor soul.

793
01:29:06,537 --> 01:29:11,452
Syrena! If you can manage a tear. I will
be grateful.

794
01:29:13,085 --> 01:29:18,115
Sadness, yes. But no sorrow... yet!

795
01:29:19,357 --> 01:29:22,130
- Not by your hand, father!
- Time and tide wait for none. Quarter master!

796
01:29:35,606 --> 01:29:40,550
Oh my, mermaids are tough. The lot of them.

797
01:29:41,036 --> 01:29:42,617
Tie her up like the others.

798
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,097
Get rid of this.

799
01:29:50,179 --> 01:29:55,670
- You are confident?
- Yes. I am a woman. So is she.

800
01:30:04,055 --> 01:30:07,223
What's your play Jack? Throwing in
with Barbossa!

801
01:30:08,434 --> 01:30:13,688
There is a girl. A female... of
the opposite sex.

802
01:30:13,723 --> 01:30:15,023
When is there not?

803
01:30:15,193 --> 01:30:17,072
Perhaps I should say, damsel.

804
01:30:17,107 --> 01:30:20,628
You're rescuing a damsel? Well there's a first!

805
01:30:20,663 --> 01:30:26,025
Yes, but it's just that I may have caused said
damsel, some manner of harm many moons ago.

806
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:27,118
Out with it.

807
01:30:27,884 --> 01:30:31,378
Gibbs, this is the woman from Seville.

808
01:30:31,697 --> 01:30:35,299
Ah you pretended to love her, then you left
her and broke her heart.

809
01:30:35,333 --> 01:30:36,227
Worse.

810
01:30:36,954 --> 01:30:39,264
I may have had... briefly mind you...

811
01:30:42,213 --> 01:30:43,522
Stirrings.

812
01:30:43,557 --> 01:30:44,585
Stirrings?

813
01:30:45,467 --> 01:30:46,611
Stirrings!

814
01:30:46,646 --> 01:30:51,845
- What then. Feelings you mean?
- No, no, no. Not quite all the way, feelings, more like...

815
01:30:56,653 --> 01:31:00,275
- Alright, feelings damn you.
- And you left her still.

816
01:31:00,773 --> 01:31:02,567
Oh that's low.

817
01:31:04,524 --> 01:31:05,982
Thank you.

818
01:31:12,977 --> 01:31:17,542
Stealth over force. I'll take it from here
on account of your, condition.

819
01:31:19,089 --> 01:31:20,978
You don't have termites, do you?

820
01:31:21,212 --> 01:31:25,425
I appreciate your concern, Jack, but I'll
be keeping you company all the same.

821
01:31:25,886 --> 01:31:28,594
Hold here, lieutenant commander. Wait
for my signal.

822
01:32:00,703 --> 01:32:03,082
There, that one. That be the leader.

823
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:05,405
Make note of his tent, because that's where...

824
01:32:06,905 --> 01:32:10,790
The white picard. That must be them
right there.

825
01:32:14,872 --> 01:32:17,044
Your sword, smells funny.

826
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:22,058
Aye. Poison. From the innards of
poisonous toads.

827
01:32:22,225 --> 01:32:27,317
- Just a scratch, your a dead man, in minutes.
- Would you mind pointing it the other way.

828
01:32:27,753 --> 01:32:29,320
I don't like toads.

829
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:37,678
- What're you doing?
- Planning an escape route.

830
01:32:38,051 --> 01:32:39,638
Isn't that how ya do it?

831
01:32:40,272 --> 01:32:41,928
Yes.

832
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:45,079
Or sometimes I just, improvise.

833
01:33:12,265 --> 01:33:13,518
Now what?

834
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:18,622
We stroll out slow and steady.

835
01:34:18,191 --> 01:34:22,616
- I'm sorry, Syrena.
- Philip, you're alive!

836
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:26,282
- Yes.
- You came for me.

837
01:34:28,704 --> 01:34:30,021
Why?

838
01:34:32,352 --> 01:34:35,003
You're different, are you not?

839
01:34:37,219 --> 01:34:41,130
You know not of kindness, compassion.

840
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:02,396
Tears of sorrow, never. Mermaids be too
tough for that.

841
01:35:03,021 --> 01:35:09,009
Tears of joy... They say these be the
more potent anyway.

842
01:35:09,315 --> 01:35:14,792
Syrena, on my word, I had no part in this!
Let her go. You don't need her now.

843
01:35:15,015 --> 01:35:17,307
Let her go? No.

844
01:35:17,758 --> 01:35:20,733
Secure her bonds. We leave her with
her own.

845
01:35:30,246 --> 01:35:34,854
- How's that escape route workin?
- Here's your chance to improvise.

846
01:35:35,381 --> 01:35:36,815
I'm attempting it.

847
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:42,055
I might be able to get a hand loose. Oh
you've got a knife. That's very good.

848
01:35:43,243 --> 01:35:44,795
Better.

849
01:35:50,696 --> 01:35:52,781
I want one of those.

850
01:35:57,066 --> 01:36:00,922
Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear.

851
01:36:01,615 --> 01:36:05,204
- Revenge?
- Come come, Hector.

852
01:36:06,136 --> 01:36:09,718
If you wanted the chalices, you'd seen they
were missing and gone.

853
01:36:10,439 --> 01:36:14,025
You were lying in waiting. For Blackbeard.

854
01:36:15,670 --> 01:36:18,840
King George, privateer, wig.

855
01:36:20,056 --> 01:36:22,199
Cheap theatrical facade. Not buying it.

856
01:36:22,234 --> 01:36:26,130
- You weren't there that night.
- When the Pearl was lost?

857
01:36:26,165 --> 01:36:28,353
Taken, not lost.

858
01:36:30,775 --> 01:36:34,634
We were off the coast of Hispaniola when
we came under attack.

859
01:36:34,669 --> 01:36:38,303
No provocation, or warning or offer
of parlay.

860
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:42,411
We were peppered with cannon fire.

861
01:36:43,606 --> 01:36:46,930
And then the sea beneath the Pearl began
to roil.

862
01:36:47,395 --> 01:36:50,331
The Pearl was pitching and yawing violently.

863
01:36:50,332 --> 01:36:54,255
Every plank everywhere, every spar
all at once, began to creak.

864
01:36:54,925 --> 01:37:00,407
The riggin had come to life. Our own
ship turned against us.

865
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,317
Tangling the crew, wrapping around
em like snakes.

866
01:37:03,726 --> 01:37:05,705
Wrapping around me leg.

867
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:08,740
But me arms were free and me sword was
to hand.

868
01:37:09,814 --> 01:37:12,062
I am the master of my ship. Not Blackbeard.

869
01:37:13,438 --> 01:37:16,594
I am the master of my fate, not Blackbeard.

870
01:37:17,455 --> 01:37:20,248
So I take what needed done.

871
01:37:27,013 --> 01:37:29,471
I survived.

872
01:37:30,233 --> 01:37:34,271
So, you're not after the fountain.

873
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:37,558
I care not for King George.

874
01:37:37,593 --> 01:37:41,175
Or tavern yarns that give hope for
heals limb.

875
01:37:42,403 --> 01:37:45,515
But I'd give me left arm for a chance
at Blackbeard.

876
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:47,931
Not your right?

877
01:37:48,007 --> 01:37:53,998
I need me good arm to drive my
poisoned blade through his heart.

878
01:37:54,969 --> 01:37:57,263
I'll see you get the chance, mate.

879
01:39:15,958 --> 01:39:17,906
The prisoner's escaping.

880
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:26,422
He's escaping! Follow! Find him!

881
01:39:29,647 --> 01:39:31,447
Hold your fire.

882
01:39:32,017 --> 01:39:33,627
I want him alive!

883
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:43,931
I take it that was the signal.

884
01:40:26,911 --> 01:40:30,116
- Go! Prepare to move out!
- The enemy is still upon us!

885
01:40:31,869 --> 01:40:33,776
I'm sorry about the chalices, chap...

886
01:40:33,811 --> 01:40:36,597
...but I have an appointment to keep. I'll
not be goin back.

887
01:40:36,632 --> 01:40:39,444
No need. Shall we have a drink?

888
01:40:39,479 --> 01:40:41,113
We'll drink at the fountain.

889
01:41:00,203 --> 01:41:04,154
How is it we can never meet without
you pointing something at me?

890
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:07,596
- You brought the chalices, Sparrow?
- Aye.

891
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:15,568
- I see you brought a friend.
- I did.

892
01:41:15,856 --> 01:41:19,420
And the one legged man. He is near?

893
01:41:19,455 --> 01:41:20,568
Aye.

894
01:41:21,453 --> 01:41:25,233
Now, before I go just handing them over,
I do have one or two conditions.

895
01:41:25,268 --> 01:41:26,423
Name them.

896
01:41:26,458 --> 01:41:28,868
Firstly, I'll be having me compass back.

897
01:41:28,903 --> 01:41:30,353
No, no. That's secondly.

898
01:41:30,388 --> 01:41:34,596
Firstly. On your word. You'll bring no
harm to Angelica.

899
01:41:34,632 --> 01:41:37,066
I'll make no vow to the likes of you, Sparrow.

900
01:41:37,101 --> 01:41:42,400
But it costs me nothing to admit
that she was never in harms way.

901
01:41:43,075 --> 01:41:47,120
Secondly then, prior to firstly. I will
be having me compass back.

902
01:41:47,776 --> 01:41:53,252
Please. I do deserve it. Do you have any idea
how difficult it was to catch that filthy pig?

903
01:41:53,606 --> 01:41:56,284
Not the big one. The four legged one.

904
01:41:59,481 --> 01:42:00,632
Thank you.

905
01:42:00,984 --> 01:42:06,164
And thirdly, Mr. Beard.
There are times, not very often...

906
01:42:06,199 --> 01:42:09,917
When I do reflect upon my heinous misdeeds.

907
01:42:09,952 --> 01:42:15,360
Chief among them. I note how poorly I
have treated Mr Gibbs, my loyal first mate.

908
01:42:15,395 --> 01:42:18,745
- Hey. Now you bring it up.
- Left him to rot in jail, I did.

909
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:23,891
Didn't care. Still Don't. But, point be.
You must let him go free.

910
01:42:25,661 --> 01:42:28,794
- Is that it?
- I think so.

911
01:42:29,329 --> 01:42:32,388
Quick, or the pig runs. And good luck
getting those chalices.

912
01:42:32,423 --> 01:42:33,825
Jack, if it's all the same to you, I'd be
just as...

913
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:35,067
Done!

914
01:42:35,491 --> 01:42:37,073
Release the swine.

915
01:42:42,673 --> 01:42:45,174
Perhaps if you don't mind I could tag
along with you folk for a...

916
01:42:48,386 --> 01:42:50,479
This will lead you to freedom, mate.

917
01:42:57,196 --> 01:42:59,867
I could have swore it was somewhere right
round here.

918
01:44:29,745 --> 01:44:31,811
We must not stop.

919
01:44:50,234 --> 01:44:51,405
Aha. Dead end.

920
01:44:52,043 --> 01:44:54,098
Dead. End.

921
01:44:54,771 --> 01:44:56,088
Dead end!

922
01:44:56,879 --> 01:45:00,274
Jack, I'm starting to think you don't
know where you're going.

923
01:45:01,018 --> 01:45:03,874
It's not the destination so much as the
journey, they say.

924
01:45:05,367 --> 01:45:07,137
Chalices if you please.

925
01:45:18,695 --> 01:45:20,301
Stand back.

926
01:45:42,293 --> 01:45:43,579
Hmm... Jack...

927
01:45:44,154 --> 01:45:48,501
Have you ever in fact, seen
with your own eyes...

928
01:45:49,356 --> 01:45:51,336
The Fountain of Youth?

929
01:45:52,061 --> 01:45:54,446
I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question?

930
01:45:54,481 --> 01:45:55,876
Quarter master.

931
01:45:56,508 --> 01:45:58,554
No, no!

932
01:46:01,247 --> 01:46:02,618
Wait, wait!

933
01:46:06,676 --> 01:46:07,952
<i>Aqua...</i>

934
01:46:08,891 --> 01:46:10,270
<i>...Da Vida.</i>

935
01:46:50,309 --> 01:46:54,258
- Master Scrum. Would you mind.
- Do I?

936
01:47:54,407 --> 01:47:56,389
So beautiful.

937
01:48:35,727 --> 01:48:39,530
Sparrow, I'll be the first to taste
those waters.

938
01:48:42,742 --> 01:48:44,100
Father...

939
01:48:47,683 --> 01:48:49,517
The one legged man.

940
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:54,122
You brought him here!

941
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:55,780
Would I do that?

942
01:48:56,518 --> 01:48:57,754
Edward Teach...

943
01:48:59,139 --> 01:49:03,979
For crimes committed on the high seas. By
the authority granted me...

944
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:08,683
...by His Majesty the King. And with a
goodly amount of personal satisfaction...

945
01:49:09,669 --> 01:49:15,623
I hereby place you in the custody of the court,
and declare you to be my prisoner.

946
01:49:17,259 --> 01:49:20,291
My?? out. Is that it?

947
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:24,260
Such crimes to include, but are not
limited to piracy...

948
01:49:24,921 --> 01:49:27,909
..treason, murder, torture..

949
01:49:27,944 --> 01:49:33,232
...of the most heinous sort, including the brutal
theft of one used, twisted, hairy right leg.

950
01:49:34,455 --> 01:49:39,406
You dare face this sword?

951
01:49:39,506 --> 01:49:42,685
- This far away from your ship. Aye.
- Aye...

952
01:49:43,258 --> 01:49:46,009
That be the cold breath of fate I feel
down my nape?

953
01:49:46,712 --> 01:49:50,979
But, I'll have one last fight.

954
01:49:51,079 --> 01:49:53,423
By God, kill em all!

955
01:49:55,789 --> 01:49:57,101
Hang on a minute.

956
01:49:58,267 --> 01:50:00,554
I just... I just need to understand
something.

957
01:50:01,730 --> 01:50:02,542
Right... so...

958
01:50:03,606 --> 01:50:08,812
You will fight against them. They will fight against
you. All on account of him, wanting to kill him?

959
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:11,912
Where is the sense?

960
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:13,927
Exactly.

961
01:50:14,711 --> 01:50:19,694
I say, let them fight each other, while we
lay back, watch, have a drink...

962
01:50:19,982 --> 01:50:21,766
Place some wagers, eh?

963
01:50:23,317 --> 01:50:24,299
Aye!

964
01:50:27,214 --> 01:50:28,460
Kill em!

965
01:50:59,043 --> 01:51:00,221
Get off me!

966
01:51:33,587 --> 01:51:35,024
Scrum, the chalices!

967
01:51:36,672 --> 01:51:37,895
And the tear. Follow!

968
01:51:43,925 --> 01:51:47,359
Hand it over. The tear. That's a good lad.

969
01:51:47,905 --> 01:51:50,184
I'm more afraid of her than I am of you.

970
01:51:55,345 --> 01:51:57,913
Hand it over! There's that good luck?

971
01:52:01,421 --> 01:52:02,826
The chalices, if you please.

972
01:52:04,081 --> 01:52:07,008
Sorry Jack. I told you. I need years.

973
01:52:07,797 --> 01:52:09,186
And now years with you.

974
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,248
Syrena...

975
01:52:45,598 --> 01:52:47,694
You will not take her!

976
01:52:48,445 --> 01:52:50,792
You have taken her. Give...

977
01:52:51,384 --> 01:52:52,581
Her back!

978
01:52:53,382 --> 01:52:56,836
Give her back, please, please!

979
01:53:22,487 --> 01:53:24,642
Hah! I expected fate to put up more of a fight, eh.

980
01:53:42,097 --> 01:53:45,494
I will not have that smile on your face
as I strike you down.

981
01:53:47,373 --> 01:53:49,654
Take a gander, Edward Teach.

982
01:54:20,745 --> 01:54:25,662
This land is hereby forever claimed in the
glorious name of his majesty, King George...

983
01:54:33,072 --> 01:54:35,229
Someone make a note, of that mans bravery.

984
01:54:43,404 --> 01:54:46,282
Senorita, the chalices. Por Favor.

985
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:08,805
Only God can grant eternal life.
Not this pagan water.

986
01:55:20,533 --> 01:55:23,197
Men, destroy this profane temple!

987
01:55:26,459 --> 01:55:27,637
The fountain!

988
01:55:41,862 --> 01:55:43,141
You are a fool.

989
01:55:43,564 --> 01:55:46,299
You seek in this place what only faith
can provide.

990
01:55:46,514 --> 01:55:47,514
Faith?

991
01:55:47,683 --> 01:55:50,250
In faith there is light enough to see the
darkness enough...

992
01:55:50,701 --> 01:55:51,920
...to blind.

993
01:55:55,372 --> 01:55:56,776
And devil is this?

994
01:56:01,499 --> 01:56:03,068
For the Pearl!

995
01:56:03,168 --> 01:56:04,275
What have you done?

996
01:56:07,494 --> 01:56:09,738
Angelica, don't! It's poison!

997
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:16,818
I'm not such the fool to take on Blackbeard...

998
01:56:17,189 --> 01:56:19,908
...without a little venomous advantage.

999
01:56:21,794 --> 01:56:23,020
Jack!

1000
01:56:34,925 --> 01:56:37,379
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew.

1001
01:56:37,479 --> 01:56:40,594
And this sword, payment for my missin limb.

1002
01:57:20,973 --> 01:57:22,049
<i>Vaminos!</i>

1003
01:57:41,778 --> 01:57:43,713
Do not waste my tear.

1004
01:58:13,306 --> 01:58:16,413
Drink this. This one has the tear.
You must drink the other.

1005
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:17,906
No!

1006
01:58:18,357 --> 01:58:21,164
I cannot save you both. One of you
must sacrifice.

1007
01:58:22,694 --> 01:58:25,613
You take it father, for your soul.

1008
01:58:27,544 --> 01:58:31,880
Captain Teach, she's dying. You must save
your daughter.

1009
01:58:34,528 --> 01:58:35,888
This one takes life?

1010
01:58:37,314 --> 01:58:40,273
- This one has the tear and gives life?
- Aye. Hurry!

1011
01:58:49,271 --> 01:58:53,101
Angelica... Save me, my child.

1012
01:58:55,451 --> 01:58:56,316
No!

1013
01:59:05,432 --> 01:59:06,856
I love you, father.

1014
01:59:19,981 --> 01:59:21,460
Wait a minute.

1015
01:59:24,165 --> 01:59:26,246
In fact, it might have been the other
way around.

1016
01:59:27,621 --> 01:59:31,235
This cup had the tear. That one had
the... other bit.

1017
01:59:31,797 --> 01:59:33,405
Trickster! Devil!

1018
01:59:33,855 --> 01:59:35,158
Father!

1019
01:59:41,652 --> 01:59:43,373
You bastard! How could you?

1020
01:59:44,060 --> 01:59:47,606
Your father saved you. Perhaps his soul
is now redeemed, eh.

1021
02:00:48,990 --> 02:00:50,414
You're hurt.

1022
02:00:53,265 --> 02:00:54,567
Body, only.

1023
02:00:56,795 --> 02:00:58,529
My mind is at peace.

1024
02:00:59,686 --> 02:01:02,684
- Cause of you.
- Me?

1025
02:01:03,632 --> 02:01:04,597
Yes.

1026
02:01:06,183 --> 02:01:07,454
I was lost...

1027
02:01:09,487 --> 02:01:12,517
...the wind. The tides...

1028
02:01:14,149 --> 02:01:15,969
They truly knew mans fate.

1029
02:01:18,838 --> 02:01:21,024
For me, only you.

1030
02:01:21,961 --> 02:01:27,254
Philip, I can save you. You need only ask.

1031
02:01:30,430 --> 02:01:33,822
- I seek but one thing.
- What is that?

1032
02:01:35,722 --> 02:01:36,899
Forgiveness.

1033
02:01:38,363 --> 02:01:40,226
If not for me you would never have
been captured.

1034
02:01:41,783 --> 02:01:46,065
- Ask!
- Forgive me.

1035
02:02:11,708 --> 02:02:13,062
I hate you!

1036
02:02:13,630 --> 02:02:15,075
The bloke that saved your life.

1037
02:02:15,359 --> 02:02:19,072
The years I possess. Stolen from my own father.

1038
02:02:19,118 --> 02:02:22,521
I only helped Blackbeard do what any
father should have done.

1039
02:02:22,593 --> 02:02:24,945
You're cruel and ignorant.

1040
02:02:29,410 --> 02:02:31,413
One pistol. One shot.

1041
02:02:33,707 --> 02:02:35,364
To kill myself before I starve?

1042
02:02:35,522 --> 02:02:37,352
Is there trust in you, love.

1043
02:02:37,451 --> 02:02:41,143
Besides, this is a well traveled trade
route. You can signal a passing ship.

1044
02:02:41,197 --> 02:02:44,531
Or you can just bite the proverbial
bullet as it were.

1045
02:02:45,111 --> 02:02:46,963
And how will I get free of these bonds?

1046
02:02:47,467 --> 02:02:49,808
You broke free of your bonds half an hour ago.

1047
02:02:49,908 --> 02:02:51,651
Waiting for the precise moment to pounce.

1048
02:02:55,426 --> 02:02:58,145
Admit it Jack. You still love me.

1049
02:02:59,082 --> 02:03:02,739
If you had a sister and a dog, I'd
choose the dog.

1050
02:03:04,029 --> 02:03:09,666
Treasure! There is a chest with jewels. Jewels
with the power to rule the wind and tide.

1051
02:03:09,833 --> 02:03:11,208
- You're making that up!
- Wait.

1052
02:03:13,831 --> 02:03:17,151
I am with child. Yours!

1053
02:03:18,252 --> 02:03:20,429
- I don't recall that we ever had...
- You were drunk!

1054
02:03:21,038 --> 02:03:22,480
I've actually never been that drunk.

1055
02:03:22,901 --> 02:03:23,850
Wait!

1056
02:03:25,914 --> 02:03:27,553
There's something I want to say to you.

1057
02:03:28,577 --> 02:03:31,627
Something I wanted to say, from the
moment we first met.

1058
02:03:33,220 --> 02:03:34,280
Go on then.

1059
02:03:36,732 --> 02:03:38,003
I love you.

1060
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:43,102
As do I.

1061
02:03:43,595 --> 02:03:46,215
Always have, always will.

1062
02:03:51,378 --> 02:03:52,669
I gotta go.

1063
02:03:53,195 --> 02:03:54,396
Jack!

1064
02:03:56,463 --> 02:03:58,070
This is not over!

1065
02:03:59,043 --> 02:04:00,050
Jack!

1066
02:04:09,858 --> 02:04:11,481
Missed!

1067
02:04:11,506 --> 02:04:16,106
<i>(Angelica yelling)</i>

1068
02:04:26,788 --> 02:04:28,937
The Revenge is mine.

1069
02:04:36,393 --> 02:04:37,365
Sir.

1070
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:41,660
I found this below deck.

1071
02:05:08,556 --> 02:05:13,065
All hands, ride to windward. Get back on
ya bloomin cockroaches

1072
02:05:16,555 --> 02:05:22,183
The crown served me well. But now by the
gods of sea and sky...

1073
02:05:22,807 --> 02:05:25,764
Make way for Tortuga!

1074
02:05:38,194 --> 02:05:40,780
Gibbs, you filthy besotted??
you made it!

1075
02:05:41,019 --> 02:05:42,057
Aye.

1076
02:05:42,743 --> 02:05:45,747
And I trust we managed a profit from our
joint enterprise.

1077
02:05:46,636 --> 02:05:48,380
Feast your eyes!

1078
02:05:54,030 --> 02:05:55,834
The compass led me straight and true.

1079
02:05:56,315 --> 02:05:58,491
What of Blackbeards men guarding the ship?

1080
02:05:58,591 --> 02:06:01,572
I employed the self same maneuver we
perfected in New Guinea.

1081
02:06:02,633 --> 02:06:05,696
Seemed a shame to leave an entire fleet behind.

1082
02:06:06,759 --> 02:06:08,033
Shame indeed.

1083
02:06:20,867 --> 02:06:22,161
I hate that monkey!

1084
02:06:23,069 --> 02:06:24,623
So, the Pearl. Any idea how to get her out?

1085
02:06:25,783 --> 02:06:28,391
We shall need a crossbow, an hourglass,
three goats...

1086
02:06:28,818 --> 02:06:30,458
...one of us must learn to play the trumpet.

1087
02:06:30,558 --> 02:06:31,767
Whilst the other one goes like this.

1088
02:06:32,399 --> 02:06:33,605
I know a man with a goat.

1089
02:06:33,958 --> 02:06:35,506
Good! I can go like this.

1090
02:06:38,499 --> 02:06:39,733
Jack, I have to ask...

1091
02:06:40,229 --> 02:06:45,168
You had the chalices, the water, the tear.
You could have lived... maybe forever!

1092
02:06:45,780 --> 02:06:47,287
The fountain does?? your years.

1093
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:50,182
But better to not know which moment
may be your last.

1094
02:06:50,631 --> 02:06:55,217
Every morsel of your entire being alive to the
infinite mystery of it all.

1095
02:06:56,139 --> 02:06:58,164
And who's to say I won't live forever, eh?

1096
02:06:59,154 --> 02:07:01,555
Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth.

1097
02:07:02,763 --> 02:07:06,885
I have no say in it, Gibbs. It's a pirates
life for me.

1098
02:07:08,258 --> 02:07:09,418
Savvy?

1099
