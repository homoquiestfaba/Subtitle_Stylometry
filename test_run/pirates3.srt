1
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,441
In order to effect a timely halt
to deteriorating conditions

2
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,349
and to ensure the common good,

3
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,312
a state of emergency is declared
for these territories

4
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,226
by decree of Lord Cutler Beckett,

5
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,419
duly appointed representative
of his majesty the king.

6
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,491
By decree according to martial law,

7
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,529
the following statutes are
temporarily amended:

8
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,496
Right to assembly:

9
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,373
suspended.

10
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,635
Right to Habeas Corpus:

11
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,346
suspended.

12
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,408
Right to legal counsel:

13
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,341
suspended.

14
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,344
Right to verdict by a jury of peers:

15
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,389
suspended.

16
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,455
By decree, all persons found guilty
of piracy

17
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:39,229
Or aiding a person convicted of piracy

18
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,360
or associating with a person
convicted of piracy

19
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,506
shall be sentenced to hang
by the neck until death.

20
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,352
Lord Beckett!

21
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,482
They've started to sing, sir.

22
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:51,298
Finally.

23
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,299
A dangerous song to be singing.

24
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,268
For any who are ignorant of his meaning.

25
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,506
Particularly a woman.

26
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,474
Particularly a woman alone.

27
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,353
What makes you think she's alone?

28
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,460
You protect her?

29
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:04,696
And what makes you think I
 need protecting?

30
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,693
Your master's expecting us.

31
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,503
And an unexpected death would cast
a slight pall on our meeting.

32
00:07:18,524 --> 00:07:19,358
aristotle

33
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,271
Have you heard anything from Will?

34
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,316
I trust young Turner to acquire the charts.

35
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,511
And you to remember your place in the
presence of Captain Sao Feng

36
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,388
Is he that terrifying?

37
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:41,382
He's much like myself, but absent my
merciful nature and sense of fair play.

38
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,296
Do you think because she is a woman
we would not suspect her of treachery?

39
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,298
Well, when you put it that way...

40
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,336
Remove...

41
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,337
...please.

42
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,474
Remove...

43
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,352
...please.

44
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,355
Captain Barbosa,

45
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,263
welcome to Singapore.

46
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,240
More steam.

47
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,426
None of that. If things don't go the
way we want.

48
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:35,427
then we are the only chance they've got

49
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:46,344
I understand that you have a request
to make of me.

50
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,379
More of a proposal to put thee.

51
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,275
I've a venture underway, and I find
myself in need of a ship and a crew.

52
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,258
It's an odd coincidence...

53
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,224
Because you happen to have a
ship and a crew you don't need?

54
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,463
No.

55
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:08,656
Because earlier this day,
 not far from here,

56
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:11,936
a thief broke into my most revered
uncle's temple

57
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:14,739
and tried to make away
 with these.

58
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,374
The navigational charts.

59
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,481
The route to the farthest gate

60
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,356
Wouldn't it be amazing if this
venture of yours

61
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,724
took you to the world
 beyond this one?

62
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:37,987
It would strain credulity,
 at that.

63
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,512
This is the thief.

64
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,481
Is his face familiar to you?

65
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,344
Then I guess

66
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,319
he has no further need for it.

67
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,357
You come into my city

68
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,270
and you betray my hospitality.

69
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,498
Sao Feng, I assure you, I had no idea...

70
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,269
That he would get caught!

71
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,339
You intend to attempt a voyage
to Davy Jones' Locker.

72
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,418
But I cannot help but
 wonder.

73
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:36,538
why?

74
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,459
The song has been sung.

75
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,461
The time is upon us.

76
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,506
We must convene the brethren court

77
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,267
as one of the nine pirate lords.

78
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,539
You must honor the call.

79
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,439
More steam.

80
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,491
More steam!

81
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,390
There is a price on all our heads.

82
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,337
It is true.

83
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,364
And since the only way a pirate
can turn a profit anymore

84
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,436
is by betraying

85
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,544
other pirates...

86
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,244
It's the time to put our differences
aside. Wait for the signal!

87
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,477
The first step

88
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,388
Now that rule is being challenged
by Lord Cutler Beckett

89
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,342
against East India Trading Company,

90
00:13:49,444 --> 00:13:51,347
what value is the brethren court?

91
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,355
You can fight!

92
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,368
Get off me!

93
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,370
You are Sao Feng,
the Pirate Lord of Singapore.

94
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,298
My bold captain will sail free waters,
where waves aren't measured in feet...

95
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,247
Would you have that era come to an end
on your watch?

96
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:17,021
The most notorious pirates from
around the world

97
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,254
are uniting against our enemy,

98
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,326
and yet you sit here
cowering in your bathwater!

99
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,264
Elizabeth Swann.

100
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,464
There is more to you than
 meets the eye.

101
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,272
isn't there?

102
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,398
And the eye

103
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,241
does not go wanting.

104
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,504
But I cannot help
 but notice

105
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,374
you have failed to answer
 my question:

106
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,480
What is it you seek in
 Davy Jones' Locker?

107
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,224
Jack Sparrow.

108
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,519
He's one of the Pirate Lords.

109
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,459
The only reason

110
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,473
I would want Jack Sparrow return
from the land of the dead

111
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,276
is so I can send him back
 myself!

112
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,284
Jack Sparrow holds one of the
nine pieces of eight.

113
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,456
He failed to pass it along to a
successor before he died.

114
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,293
So we must go and get him back.

115
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,424
So

116
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,264
you admit

117
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,232
you have deceived me.

118
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,273
Weapons!

119
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,470
Sao Feng, I assure you, our
 intentions are strictly honorable.

120
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,490
Drop your weapons

121
00:15:59,258 --> 00:15:59,519
or I kill the man!

122
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,352
Kill him. He's not our man.

123
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,267
If he's not with you and he's not with us...

124
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,266
who is he with?

125
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,229
take aim!

126
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,488
Set, fire!

127
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,396
Doublez! take aim

128
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,306
Set...

129
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,445
Fire!

130
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,455
It's an odd coincidence, isn't it?

131
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:24,425
The East India Trading Company finds 
me the day you show up in Singapore.

132
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,237
It is coincidence only.

133
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,239
If you want to make a deal 
with Beckett.

134
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,311
you need what I offer.

135
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,344
You crossed Barbosa.

136
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,248
You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.

137
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,350
Why should I expect any better?

138
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,322
I need the Black Pearl to free my father.

139
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,417
You're helping me to get it.

140
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:07,507
Fire!

141
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,266
Thank you, Jack!

142
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,400
Thank you, Jack!

143
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,326
You have the charts?

144
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,439
And better yet.

145
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,474
A ship with a crew.

146
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,309
Where's Sao Feng?

147
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,468
He'll cover our escape and
meet us in Shipwreck Cove.

148
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,256
Hold it stiff into the wind!

149
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,327
There's no place left for Sao Feng to cower.

150
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,297
Do you think he will honor the call?

151
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,529
I cannot say.

152
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,431
There is an evil and disease

153
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:13,567
that even the most staunch and blood
thirsty pirates have come to fear.

154
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:24,224
A piece of eight.

155
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,407
Nine of them, you say?

156
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,254
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.

157
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:30,548
Nine pieces of eight.

158
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,315
What's the significance of that, I wonder?

159
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,416
Does it matter?

160
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:38,293
Nothing can hold against the Armada.
Not even the Flying Dutchman,I believe.

161
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,456
Nothing we know of.

162
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,402
Did your friend happen to mention
 where the Brethren Court are meeting?

163
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,460
He was mum on that, sir.

164
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,265
Then he knows the value of information.

165
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,274
Better keep this between ourselves.

166
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,280
We don't want anyone running off
to Singapore, do we?

167
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,485
Ah, Admiral.

168
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,445
You summoned me, Lord Beckett?

169
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,483
Yes. Something for you there.

170
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,385
Your new station deserves
 an old friend.

171
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,306
Not more requisition orders?

172
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,312
No sir.

173
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,243
Execution.

174
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,312
The Brethren know they face
 extinction.

175
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,258
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

176
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,480
No one said anything about cold.

177
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:14,414
I'm sure there must be a good
reason for our suffering.

178
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,386
Why don't that obae woman just
bring Jack back,

179
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,396
the same way she brought back Barbosa?

180
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,433
Because Barbosa was only dead.

181
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:28,271
Jack Sparrow is taken in body and soul

182
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,342
to a place not of death

183
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,307
but punishment.

184
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:37,448
The worst fate a person can
bring upon himself.

185
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,507
Stretching on forever.

186
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,411
That's what awaits in Davy Jones' Locker.

187
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,455
I mean, that was a good reason.

188
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,366
Nothing here is said.

189
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,403
It is hardly as accurate as modern charts.
- No.

190
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:13,812
But it leads to more places.

191
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,383
"OVER THE EDGE"

192
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,222
"OVER AGAIN"

193
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,493
"SUNRISE SETS FLASH OF GREEN"

194
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,334
Do you care to interpret,

195
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,330
Captain Barbosa?

196
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:40,400
Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?

197
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,481
I reckon I've seen my fair share.

198
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:46,282
Happens on rare occasion,

199
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,277
at the last glimpse of sunset, 
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

200
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:54,248
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.

201
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,219
Some claimed to have seen it
who ain't. And some say...

202
00:24:59,254 --> 00:24:59,494
It signals when a soul comes
back to this world

203
00:24:59,595 --> 00:25:01,219
from the dead.

204
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:06,236
Sorry.

205
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,398
Trust me, young master Turner,

206
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,409
it's not getting to the land of the
dead that's the problem.

207
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,279
It's getting back.

208
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:03,180
Back to her! Lift the sail!
- Aye, aye, sir!

209
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:08,182
Bloody hell, there's nothing left.

210
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,325
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

211
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,497
Fetch the chest.

212
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:15,461
And the Governour?

213
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,401
He's been asking questions about
 the heart.

214
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,247
Does he know?

215
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:30,446
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

216
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,292
Steady, men.

217
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,371
Go.

218
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:54,460
All of you.

219
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,400
And take that infernal thing with you.

220
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,412
I will not have it on my ship!

221
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,276
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

222
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,282
Because I will.

223
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,351
Because it seems to me the only
way to ensure

224
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:11,253
that this ship do as directed
by the Company.

225
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,259
We need prisoners to interrogate,

226
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,390
which tends to work best
 when they're alive.

227
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:26,403
The Dutchman sails as its
 captain commands.

228
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:30,272
And its captain is to sail it as commanded!

229
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:36,403
I would have thought you'd learned that
when I had ordered you to kill your pet

230
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,340
This is no longer your world, Jones.

231
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,251
The immaterial

232
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,322
has become

233
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,418
immaterial.

234
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,229
Charge.
- aim

235
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,402
How long will we continue not talking?

236
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,471
Once we rescue Jack,
everything will be fine.

237
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,346
Then we rescue Jack.

238
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,372
There is a cost must be paid
 in the end.

239
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:30,459
Barbosa!

240
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,359
Ahead!

241
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:34,456
Aye, we're good and lost now.

242
00:30:35,696 --> 00:30:36,468
Lost?

243
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:40,260
For certain you have to be lost
to find a place as can't be found.

244
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,274
Elseways everyone would know
 where it was.

245
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,365
We're gaining speed!
- Aye.

246
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,300
To stations!

247
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,210
All hands to stations!

248
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:51,211
stations

249
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,281
Haul the boat away

250
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,414
Never lay down!

251
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,321
Let her run straight and true.

252
00:31:03,777 --> 00:31:04,549
Blimey!

253
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,407
We're doomed, that's all.

254
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,435
Don't be so unkind.

255
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,472
You may not survive to pass
 this way again.

256
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:28,283
And these are the last friendly
words you'll hear.

257
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,432
All to port!

258
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,302
my pieces

259
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,295
laggers, slack 'em braces!

260
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,506
Aye, Captain!

261
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,439
Slack 'em braces!

262
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,502
Step lively at the wheel

263
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,403
right away

264
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,277
fire down below

265
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,486
Help!
- man the yars ye filthy toads!

266
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,462
seize handsomely boys

267
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,336
Aye, right away

268
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,445
Mr Sparrow?
- Aye, captain.

269
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:22,322
What say you about the condition
of this tack-on?

270
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,486
It be proper to my eye, sir.

271
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,326
Proper?

272
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,266
It is neither proper nor suitable,sir,
it is not acceptable, nor adequate,

273
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,359
it is an obvious fact.

274
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,494
An abomination.

275
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,472
Begging your pardon, sir, but perhaps
if you gave a man another chance...

276
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,332
Shall I?

277
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,316
That sort of thinking got us
 into this mess.

278
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:51,454
We have lost speed, and therefore time.

279
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,245
Precious time,

280
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,359
which cannot be recovered once lost.

281
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,387
Do you understand?
- Aye, aye, captain.

282
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,330
Do you now? It will all have to
 be redone.

283
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:04,435
All of it.

284
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,463
And let this serve as a lesson
to the lot of you.

285
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,394
Doldrum, sir,

286
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,339
has the entire crew on edge.

287
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:14,311
I have no sympathy for any
of you feculant maggots,

288
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,346
and no more patience to pretend
 otherwise.

289
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,412
Gentlemen, I wash my hands
of this weirdness.

290
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,466
No wind.

291
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,232
Of course there's no bloody wind!

292
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,496
My soul, I do swear for the place.

293
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,273
Gust, whisper,

294
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,275
tiny miniature lick!

295
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,249
Yes sir, I know, but why?
Why would he do that?

296
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,261
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

297
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,262
We shall have a magnificent
 garden party,

298
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,264
and you're not invited,

299
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:42,724
A rock.

300
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,394
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never heard that before.

301
00:37:13,686 --> 00:37:21,227
Oh! A rope.

302
00:39:38,324 --> 00:39:40,872
This truly is a godforsaken place.

303
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:43,235
I don't see Jack.

304
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,209
I don't see anyone.

305
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,307
He's here.

306
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:51,386
Davy Jones never once gave up
that what he took.

307
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,389
And does it matter?

308
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,388
We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.

309
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:03,222
Witty Jack is closer than you think.

310
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,231
Impossible.

311
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,221
Slap me thrice 'n' hand me
to me momma- it's Jack!

312
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,268
It's the Captain!
- like my sword

313
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:18,273
Jack!
- Mr Gibbs?

314
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,364
Aye, captain!
- I thought so.

315
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,245
I expect you're able to accoun
for your actions then.

316
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:23,508
Sir?

317
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,476
There has been a perpetual and virulent
 lack of discipline on my vessel why?

318
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,286
Why is that, sir?

319
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,422
Sir, you're you're in
Davy Jones' Locker, Captain.

320
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:38,864
I know that.

321
00:41:40,176 --> 00:41:43,065
I know where I am. And don't 
think I don't.

322
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,325
Jack Sparrow.

323
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:50,262
Ah, Hector.It's been too long,
 hasn't it?

324
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,274
Aye. "Illy doo Mooahrtay", remember?

325
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,242
You shot me.

326
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,405
No I didn't.

327
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,346
Tia Dalma! Out and about, aye?

328
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:04,282
You add an agreeable sense of macabre
to any delirium.

329
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,354
He thinks we're a hallucination.

330
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,219
William, tell me something.

331
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,220
Have you come because you need my help
to save a certain distressing damsel,

332
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,424
or rather damsel in distress?

333
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,325
Either one.

334
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:19,402
No.

335
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,664
Well, then you wouldn't be here,
 would you.

336
00:42:22,114 --> 00:42:22,975
So you can't be here.

337
00:42:23,533 --> 00:42:25,467
Q.e.d.
 you're not really here.

338
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,368
Jack

339
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,311
This is real. We're here.

340
00:42:41,448 --> 00:42:45,407
The locker, you say?
- Aye.

341
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,362
We've come to rescue you.

342
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,333
have you now.

343
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:52,357
Very kind of you.

344
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,271
But it would seem that as I possess
a ship and you don't,

345
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,307
you're the ones in need of rescuing,

346
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,434
and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.

347
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,277
I see my ship

348
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,344
right there.

349
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:09,452
Can't spot it.

350
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:13,255
Must be a tiny little thing, hiding
somewhere behind the Pearl.

351
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,449
Jack, Cutler Beckett has the
heart of Davy Jones.

352
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:18,386
He controls the Flying Dutchman.
- He's taking over the seas!

353
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,225
The song has already been sung.

354
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,333
The Brethren Court is called.

355
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,403
Leave you people alone for just a minute
look whats happened, gone to pot!

356
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,267
Aye, Jack, the world needs
you back up here

357
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:30,499
And you need a crew.

358
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,344
Why should I sail with any of you?

359
00:43:36,412 --> 00:43:38,403
Four of you have tried to kill me in
the past. One of you succeeded.

360
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,448
Oh! She's not told you!

361
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,482
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

362
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,462
As for you

363
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:58,486
Now, don't tell me you didn't
enjoy it the other day.

364
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:02,208
Fair enough all right, you lady.

365
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,238
Don't need you. You scare me.

366
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,468
What gives, you can come. Marty.

367
00:44:08,533 --> 00:44:09,420
Cotton!

368
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:13,381
some parrot
At least I'll have someone to talk to.

369
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,254
Who are you?
- Tai Huang.

370
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:21,448
These are my men.

371
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,285
Where do your allegiances lie?
- With the highest bidder.

372
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,521
I have a ship.

373
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,230
That makes you the highest bidder.

374
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,356
Good man.

375
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:33,367
away anchor. All hands,
prepare to make sail.

376
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,471
Which way are you going, Jack?

377
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,250
Trim that sail!Slack winglet braces!
Trim that sail!Slack winglet braces!

378
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,218
<i>What are you doing?
- What are you doing?</i>

379
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,416
<i>No, what are you doing?</i>

380
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,494
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

381
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,227
The captain gives orders on the ship.

382
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,298
The captain of this ship is 
giving orders.

383
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,297
My ship, makes me captain.

384
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:06,426
They be my charts.

385
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:08,533
That makes you- chartman.

386
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,373
Stow away!

387
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,466
Don't move you! That's an order! Understand?

388
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:20,483
Sorry.

389
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:25,344
I just thought,with the captain issue,
I'd throw in my name for consideration.

390
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,379
Sorry.

391
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,430
I'd vote for you.
- Yes.

392
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,492
You left Jack to the Kraken.

393
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,463
He's rescued now. It's done with.

394
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,376
Will, I had no choice.

395
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,310
You chose not to tell me.

396
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:25,508
I couldn't.

397
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,342
It wasn't your burden to bear.

398
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:31,414
Well, I did bear it, didn't I?

399
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,355
I just didn't know what it was.

400
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,290
I thought...

401
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:43,322
You thought I loved him.

402
00:46:49,897 --> 00:46:51,361
If you make your choices alone,

403
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:53,400
how can I trust you?

404
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,447
You can't.

405
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,343
Eerie.

406
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,381
That's downright macabre.

407
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:40,413
I wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them.

408
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:52,468
Be disrespectful, you would?

409
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:56,338
They should be in the care of
Davy Jones.

410
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:01,309
That was the duty 'im was
 charged with

411
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,339
by the goddess Calypso,

412
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:10,250
to ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

413
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:16,221
And every ten years,

414
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,419
'im could come ashore

415
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,388
to be with she 'o love 'im.

416
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,461
Truly.

417
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,272
But the man has become a monster.

418
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:35,300
So he wasn't always tentacly?

419
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:38,436
No...

420
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:43,213
'im was a man...

421
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,420
once.

422
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,497
Now there's boats coming.

423
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,364
They're not a threat to us.

424
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,241
Am I right?

425
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:08,276
We are nothing but ghosts to them.

426
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,470
We've better as just let them be.

427
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:27,360
It's my father! We've made it back!

428
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,228
Father! Father, I'm up here!

429
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,396
Elizabeth.

430
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,472
We're not back.

431
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,413
Father!

432
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,246
Elizabeth!

433
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:51,311
Are you dead?

434
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,253
No...

435
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,282
I think I am.

436
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,318
No, you can't be!

437
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:01,252
There was this chest,

438
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:02,365
you see.

439
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:04,500
I thought.

440
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,269
At the time it seemed so important.

441
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,335
Come on board!

442
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:10,397
And a heart.

443
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,309
I learnt that if you stab the heart,

444
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,269
yours must take its place,

445
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,278
and you will sail the seas for eternity.

446
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:22,384
The Dutchman must have a captain.

447
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,515
Silly thing to die for.

448
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,818
Someone cast a line!

449
00:50:27,853 --> 00:50:29,280
Come back with us!

450
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,857
I told you, I'm destiny.

451
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,266
Take the line!

452
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,308
I was so proud of you, Elizabeth.

453
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,502
Hold on to the line!

454
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,475
She must not leave the ship!
- Father!

455
00:50:55,522 --> 00:50:59,240
Please come with us! Please don't leave me!

456
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,423
I'll give your love to your mother,
 shall I?

457
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,517
I won't let you go!
- Elizabeth...

458
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,366
He made peace.

459
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,380
No wa'er. Why is all but the rum gone?

460
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:35,449
Rum's gone, too.

461
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,469
If we cannot escape these doldrums

462
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:48,498
before night,

463
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:50,431
I fear we will sail

464
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,203
on trackless seas,

465
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:56,468
doomed to roam between worlds forever.

466
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:01,441
With no water, forever looks to
be arriving a mite too soon.

467
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:04,249
Why doesn't he do something?

468
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:06,289
Me eye! Give it back!

469
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,257
There's no sense to it.

470
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:09,384
And the green flash happens at sunset.

471
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,451
Not sunrise.

472
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,486
"Over the edge. "

473
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:16,331
God, driving me over the blooming edge.

474
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:19,334
Sunrises don't set.

475
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,433
"UP IS DOWN"

476
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,274
Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.

477
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,402
Why are these things never clear?

478
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:32,448
Clear as mud, Jacky.
- What?

479
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:39,956
Stab the heart. Don't stem the heart.

480
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,314
Come again?

481
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:43,291
The Dutchman must have a captain.

482
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,327
Well, that's even more than
less than unhelpful.

483
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,463
Sail the seas for eternity.

484
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:51,263
I love the sea.
- What about port?

485
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:52,425
I prefer rum.

486
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:53,503
Rum's good.

487
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:54,504
Making port,

488
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:57,467
where we can get rum and salty wenches...

489
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,340
Once every ten years.

490
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,345
What did you say?

491
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:03,437
Once every ten years.

492
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,272
Ten years is a long time, mate.

493
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,274
Even longer, given the deficit of rum.

494
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,386
But eternity is longer still.

495
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:13,222
And how will you be spending it?

496
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,357
Dead? Or not?

497
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,461
The immortal Captain Sparrow.

498
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,291
Well, I'd love that.

499
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,260
Come sunset, it won't matter.

500
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:27,462
Not sunset.

501
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,399
"SUNDOWN AND RISE"

502
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,511
...up!

503
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,281
What's that?

504
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:42,342
What is that?

505
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,443
I don't know.

506
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:44,453
What do you think?

507
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:45,454
Where?

508
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:46,489
There.

509
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,472
What is it?

510
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:24,417
We're rocking the ship!

511
00:54:29,084 --> 00:54:31,645
Aye, he's on to it!

512
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,339
He's rocking the ship!

513
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:40,173
We tie each other to the mast upside
down, so when the boat flips we will

514
00:54:40,274 --> 00:54:41,274
be the right way up!

515
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:43,276
thats swell

516
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:47,283
Loose the cannons, you stinking mildrads!

517
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,351
Unstow the cargo!

518
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,249
Let it surf!

519
00:55:59,566 --> 00:56:00,729
Now up...

520
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:03,359
is down.

521
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:43,355
Blessed sweet westerlies!

522
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:47,225
We're back!

523
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:51,458
There's the sunrise.

524
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,511
We need our pistols. Get untied, alright?

525
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,293
Alright then!

526
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:29,233
The Brethren Court has a gathering
at Shipwreck Cove,

527
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:32,466
and Jack, you and I are a-going,
and there'll be no arguing that point.

528
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,277
<i>I is arguing the point.</i>

529
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:38,313
If these pirates are gathering, I'm
pointing my ship the other way.

530
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:41,348
The pirates are gathering to fight
Beckett, and you're a pirate.

531
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:44,311
Fight or not, you're not running, Jack.

532
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:48,413
If we don't stand together, they'll 
hunt us down, till there be none left.

533
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,324
Quite like the sound of it.

534
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,326
Captain Jack Sparrow-

535
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,226
the last pirate.

536
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,358
Aye, and you'll be fighting Jones alone.

537
00:59:00,499 --> 00:59:02,260
How does that figure into your plan?

538
00:59:02,726 --> 00:59:03,856
I'm still working on that.

539
00:59:04,994 --> 00:59:06,706
But I will not be going back to the
locker, nay.

540
00:59:07,068 --> 00:59:08,685
Count on that.

541
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:21,793
Why, we can still use them as clubs!

542
00:59:24,487 --> 00:59:25,441
Sorry.

543
00:59:25,819 --> 00:59:26,418
Effective, though.

544
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,926
There's a freshwater spring on this island.

545
00:59:30,455 --> 00:59:32,883
We can resupply there and get back
to shooting each other later.

546
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:36,943
You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.

547
00:59:36,978 --> 00:59:38,400
I'm not leaving my ship in your 
command.

548
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:43,068
Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command?

549
00:59:44,749 --> 00:59:46,130
Temporarily.

550
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:17,685
Criminy!

551
01:00:18,017 --> 01:00:18,804
Odds bodkins!

552
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:39,419
Careful! Careful!

553
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,204
You stupid fish!
- Actually, it's a cephalopod.

554
01:00:46,325 --> 01:00:50,431
hope you're right. I bet
people will pay a shilling to see this.

555
01:00:50,466 --> 01:00:52,439
And another shilling for a sketch
from seeing it drop.

556
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:57,377
then we will get some cracking slayers.

557
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,385
We could give us a slice as a souvenir.

558
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,354
Still thinking of running, Jack?

559
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,519
Think you can outrun the world?

560
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,264
You know, the problem

561
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,267
with being the last of anything-

562
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,496
by and by, there'll be none left at all.

563
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,233
Sometimes things come back, mate.

564
01:01:22,747 --> 01:01:24,216
We're living proof, you and me.

565
01:01:24,909 --> 01:01:26,871
Aye, but that's a gamble of luck
now, ain't it?

566
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,416
There's never a guarantee of coming back.

567
01:01:31,612 --> 01:01:33,776
Passing on, that's dead certain.

568
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:40,297
Summoning the Brethren Court then,
 is it?

569
01:01:40,332 --> 01:01:42,419
It's our only hope left.

570
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:46,181
That's a sad commentary
 in and of itself.

571
01:01:48,716 --> 01:01:50,385
The world used to be a bigger place.

572
01:01:54,073 --> 01:01:55,296
The world's still the same.

573
01:01:57,821 --> 01:02:00,173
There's just less in it.

574
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,963
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

575
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:31,143
Aye, I know him! He was in Singapore.

576
01:02:31,144 --> 01:02:33,338
Singapore!

577
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,283
We got company!

578
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:52,356
He's the captain.

579
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,481
Sao Feng! You showing up here,

580
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,375
it is truly a remarkable coincidence.

581
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:16,280
Jack Sparrow.

582
01:03:16,281 --> 01:03:18,641
You paid me great insult once.

583
01:03:18,676 --> 01:03:20,262
That doesn't sound like me.

584
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:26,257
So we just call it square then?

585
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,675
Release her!

586
01:03:30,116 --> 01:03:31,453
She's not part of the bargain.

587
01:03:31,488 --> 01:03:33,274
And what bargain be that?

588
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,741
You heard Captain Turner?

589
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:39,554
Release her.

590
01:03:39,589 --> 01:03:43,443
Captain Turner?- Aye, the perfidious
rotter lead a mutiny against us.

591
01:03:43,478 --> 01:03:45,243
I need the Pearl to free my father.

592
01:03:46,209 --> 01:03:48,282
That's the only reason I came on
this voyage.

593
01:03:49,871 --> 01:03:51,234
Why didn't you tell me you were
planning this?

594
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,601
<i>That was my burden to bear.</i>

595
01:03:56,652 --> 01:04:00,156
He needs the Pearl?
Captain Turner needs the Pearl?

596
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:01,851
And you felt guilty.

597
01:04:02,364 --> 01:04:04,397
And you and your Brethren Court...

598
01:04:06,406 --> 01:04:09,366
Did no one come to save me just
because they missed me?

599
01:04:18,477 --> 01:04:19,992
I'm standing over there with him.

600
01:04:21,752 --> 01:04:22,943
I'm sorry, Jack.

601
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:26,895
But there is an old friend
who wants to see you first.

602
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,457
I'm not certain I can survive any
more visits from old friends.

603
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:34,463
If you're so jealous to find out.

604
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,877
Curious.

605
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:49,680
Your friends appear to be quite
desperate, Jack.

606
01:04:50,662 --> 01:04:54,245
they no longer believe that a gathering
of squabbling pirates can defeat

607
01:04:57,293 --> 01:05:00,285
the Flying Dutchman,and
so despair leads to betrayal.

608
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:03,227
But you and I are no strangers 
to betrayal,

609
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:04,499
are we?

610
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,371
It's not here, Jack.

611
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:14,275
What? What isn't?

612
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,368
The heart of Davy Jones.
It's safely aboard the Dutchman,

613
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:22,944
and unavailable for you sir's leverage
to satisfy your debt to the captain.

614
01:05:22,979 --> 01:05:25,252
By my reckoning, that account
has been settled.

615
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:27,250
By your death.

616
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:29,514
And yet here you are.

617
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:34,458
Close your eyes and pretend it's all a
bad dream. That's how I get by.

618
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,881
And if Davy Jones were to learn
of your survival?

619
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:44,464
be on your guard, men.

620
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,401
My men are crew enough.

621
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:52,242
Company ship, company crew.

622
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,250
He agreed. The Black Pearl was to be mine.

623
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:58,343
And so it was.

624
01:06:01,726 --> 01:06:03,681
Perhaps you consider an
alternative arrangement.

625
01:06:04,311 --> 01:06:07,262
One which requires absolutely
nothing from you

626
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,755
but information.

627
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,438
Regarding the Brethren Court no doubt.

628
01:06:18,765 --> 01:06:20,628
In exchange for fair compensation.

629
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,344
Square my debt with Jones,

630
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,276
guarantee my freedom

631
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:29,444
Of course. It's just good business.

632
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,455
Were I in a divulgeatory mood,

633
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,287
what then might I divulge?

634
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,384
Everything.

635
01:06:39,471 --> 01:06:40,606
Where are they meeting?

636
01:06:41,644 --> 01:06:42,996
Who are the Pirate Lords?

637
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:46,528
What is the purpose of
the nine pieces of eight?

638
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:58,823
Beckett agreed. The Black Pearl
was to be mine.

639
01:06:58,858 --> 01:07:02,973
Lord Beckett's not gonna give up only
ship as can outrun the Dutchman,is he?

640
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:13,808
Shame that you're not bound to honor
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

641
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,491
Because honor's a hard thing
to come by nowadays.

642
01:07:18,155 --> 01:07:21,251
There is no honor to remain here
with the losing side.

643
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,404
Leaving it for the winning side

644
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:24,498
is just good business.

645
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,342
The losing side, you say?

646
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,273
They have the Dutchman.

647
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:30,536
Now the Pearl!

648
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,246
And what do the Brethren have?

649
01:07:34,247 --> 01:07:38,797
We have Calypso.

650
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:48,224
Calypso!

651
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,502
An old legend.

652
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:54,359
No.

653
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:58,496
The goddess herself, bound in
 human form.

654
01:07:58,497 --> 01:08:04,222
Imagine all the power as you see is
brought to bear against our enemy.

655
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:06,280
I intend to release her,

656
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:09,249
but for that I need the Brethren Court.

657
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,285
All the Court.

658
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:16,517
Then keep Barbosa,

659
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:19,420
the belligerent homunculus and his
friend with the wooden eye, both,

660
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,354
and Turner.

661
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:24,228
Especially Turner.

662
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,998
The rest go with me aboard the Pearl,
and I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,

663
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:30,726
 I will hand you the pirates, and
you will not hand me to Jones.

664
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,408
Bloody fair deal, don't you think?

665
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:35,500
And what becomes of Miss Swann?

666
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,501
What interest is she to you?

667
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:45,250
What are you proposing, Captain?

668
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:47,378
What be accepted... Captain.

669
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,325
The girl.

670
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,291
Jack.

671
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:58,554
I've just recalled- I've got this
wonderful compass,

672
01:08:59,332 --> 01:09:01,395
which points to whatever I want.

673
01:09:02,707 --> 01:09:04,531
So for what do I need you?

674
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:07,057
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

675
01:09:07,058 --> 01:09:08,058
Out of the question.

676
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:10,775
It was not a question.

677
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,833
Point you to the thing you want most?
that is not the Brethren Court,is it?

678
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:16,443
Then what is, Jack?

679
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:18,253
Me.

680
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:20,617
Dead.

681
01:09:20,618 --> 01:09:21,459
Done.

682
01:09:21,945 --> 01:09:22,624
What?

683
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:23,915
Not done!

684
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:26,624
You got us into this mess.
If this is what frees us, then done!

685
01:09:27,418 --> 01:09:28,068
Done.

686
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:38,531
Although if I kill you, then I can use
the compass to find Shipwreck Cove?

687
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:40,367
On my own.

688
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:43,064
Cut out the middleman, as it were.

689
01:09:43,322 --> 01:09:45,213
Elizabeth, they are pirates!

690
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:47,381
I have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

691
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,806
Then we have an accord?

692
01:09:53,488 --> 01:09:55,454
With me killed, you'd arrive at the Cove

693
01:09:56,007 --> 01:09:58,221
to find it's a stronghold nigh
 impregnable,

694
01:09:58,882 --> 01:10:01,851
able to withstand blockade for years,

695
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,120
and then you'd be wishing,

696
01:10:03,236 --> 01:10:05,747
"Oh, if only there were
someone I had not killed

697
01:10:05,987 --> 01:10:10,189
inside, to ensure that the pirates
then come outside. "

698
01:10:11,394 --> 01:10:12,946
And you can accomplish all this,
 can you?

699
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:16,657
You may kill me, but you may
never insult me.

700
01:10:17,844 --> 01:10:18,641
Who am I?

701
01:10:21,571 --> 01:10:22,975
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow!

702
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:13,568
By this time tomorrow, we will arrive
at Shipwreck Cove,and you will be free.

703
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:15,447
Calypso.

704
01:13:18,017 --> 01:13:18,491
Excuse me?

705
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:24,042
Not a name you fancy, I'd imagine,
out of the many that you have.

706
01:13:24,886 --> 01:13:26,445
But it is what we call you.

707
01:13:27,939 --> 01:13:29,654
"We" being who?

708
01:13:34,525 --> 01:13:35,874
You confirm it!

709
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:38,437
Confirm what?

710
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:43,695
You've told me nothing.
- The Brethren Court, not I.

711
01:13:45,286 --> 01:13:49,189
The first Brethren Court whose
decision I would have opposed.

712
01:13:51,113 --> 01:13:54,117
They bound you to human form
so the rule of the seas

713
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:57,175
would belong to man and not...
- To me.

714
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:05,357
But one such as you should never be
anything less than what you are.

715
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:07,367
Pretty speech from a captor.

716
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:11,471
But words whispered through prison
bars lose their charm.

717
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:15,245
Can I be blamed for my efforts?

718
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:21,033
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

719
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:25,359
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

720
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:28,292
I offer simply my desire.

721
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:32,500
And in return?

722
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:37,325
I would have your gifts, should
you choose to give them.

723
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:42,396
And if I should choose

724
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:44,418
not?

725
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:47,474
Then I will take...

726
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:51,280
your fury!

727
01:15:16,505 --> 01:15:17,623
Sao Feng?

728
01:15:19,355 --> 01:15:22,379
Come here. Please.

729
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:34,142
With all nine pieces of eight,

730
01:15:34,177 --> 01:15:36,278
you will be free.

731
01:15:37,935 --> 01:15:39,375
Take it!

732
01:15:41,077 --> 01:15:43,400
You are captain now.

733
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:45,295
Me?

734
01:15:47,871 --> 01:15:53,250
Go on my place to Shipwreck Cove.

735
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,387
Forgive me, Calypso.

736
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:18,439
What did he tell you?

737
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:25,370
He made me captain.

738
01:16:36,511 --> 01:16:37,593
You are not my captain.

739
01:16:39,132 --> 01:16:39,954
Elizabeth!

740
01:16:41,151 --> 01:16:42,393
James!

741
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:52,373
Your father will be overjoyed to know
you're safe.

742
01:16:52,909 --> 01:16:53,815
My father's dead!

743
01:16:55,105 --> 01:16:57,248
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

744
01:16:58,462 --> 01:17:00,519
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

745
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:04,708
Who among you do you name as captain?

746
01:17:04,898 --> 01:17:06,039
Captain? Her.

747
01:17:10,884 --> 01:17:12,581
Captain!
- Tow the ship.

748
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:15,460
Put the prisoners in the brig.

749
01:17:17,028 --> 01:17:20,937
The captain shall have my quarters.
- Thank you, sir-

750
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:24,302
but I prefer to remain with my crew.

751
01:17:24,303 --> 01:17:25,303
Elizabeth-

752
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:28,994
I swear- I did not know.

753
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,353
Know what?

754
01:17:31,692 --> 01:17:32,967
Which side you chose?

755
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:43,374
Well, now you do.

756
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:18,288
You know my name?

757
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:22,464
Yes. I know your son.

758
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:26,401
Will Turner.

759
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:29,370
William!

760
01:18:35,005 --> 01:18:36,241
He made it!

761
01:18:36,276 --> 01:18:37,478
He's alive!

762
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:40,689
And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.

763
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:45,486
Godswoons, he's on his way!

764
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:48,284
Yes, Will is alive.

765
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:50,280
And he wants to help you.

766
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:57,489
He can't help me.

767
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,298
He won't come.

768
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:01,436
But you're his father!

769
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:04,294
I know you.

770
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,464
He spoke of you.

771
01:19:08,889 --> 01:19:09,841
He can't save me.

772
01:19:10,402 --> 01:19:11,829
He can't come because of you.

773
01:19:13,327 --> 01:19:15,249
Me?

774
01:19:16,139 --> 01:19:18,684
You're Elizabeth.

775
01:19:19,339 --> 01:19:20,196
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.

776
01:19:22,486 --> 01:19:26,761
If Jones be slain, he who slays him
must take his place.

777
01:19:28,117 --> 01:19:30,825
Captain forever.

778
01:19:33,579 --> 01:19:36,333
The Dutchman must always have
 a captain.

779
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:39,473
And if he saves me,

780
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:42,443
he loses you.

781
01:19:48,562 --> 01:19:50,520
You won't pick me.

782
01:19:51,592 --> 01:19:53,313
I wouldn't pick me.

783
01:19:58,667 --> 01:20:00,169
Tell him not to come.

784
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,683
Tell him to stay away.

785
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:07,473
Tell him it's too late.

786
01:20:09,516 --> 01:20:11,365
I'm already a part of the ship.

787
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,112
And the crew.

788
01:20:17,697 --> 01:20:18,602
Bootstrap.

789
01:20:21,619 --> 01:20:23,140
You know my name!

790
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:26,386
You know my name!

791
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:29,482
Yes, I knew your son.

792
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:32,260
William?

793
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:36,421
He's coming for me.

794
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:39,255
Wait and see.

795
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,297
You'll see.

796
01:20:43,497 --> 01:20:46,049
He promised.

797
01:21:17,512 --> 01:21:18,051
Sir!

798
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:26,300
A breadcrumb trail,
and we are meant to follow.

799
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:27,853
A betrayer among them.

800
01:21:28,762 --> 01:21:29,968
Or a trap.

801
01:21:30,299 --> 01:21:33,478
A gambit by a skilled opponent.

802
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,999
Adjust course, Lieutenant.

803
01:21:37,936 --> 01:21:38,618
Sir.

804
01:21:40,755 --> 01:21:42,664
We can only hope to reach our
destination

805
01:21:42,871 --> 01:21:45,091
before they run out of bodies.

806
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:02,211
You escaped the brig even
quicker than I expected.

807
01:22:02,839 --> 01:22:03,568
William-

808
01:22:04,845 --> 01:22:06,387
do you notice anything?

809
01:22:07,454 --> 01:22:08,575
Rather,

810
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:13,359
do you notice something that is
not there to be noticed?

811
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:15,098
You haven't raised an alarm.

812
01:22:15,852 --> 01:22:16,605
Odd, isn't it.

813
01:22:17,262 --> 01:22:18,284
Not as odd as this.

814
01:22:20,097 --> 01:22:21,884
Come up with this all by you alone,
 did you?

815
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:24,639
I said to myself: "Think like Jack".

816
01:22:25,802 --> 01:22:27,085
This is what you've arrived at?

817
01:22:28,154 --> 01:22:30,750
Leave Beckett the Shipwreck
Cove so as to gain his trust,

818
01:22:31,367 --> 01:22:32,653
accomplish your own ends?

819
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:34,509
It's like you don't know me at all,
 mate.

820
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:41,287
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?

821
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,219
Ahh.

822
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:46,394
You've not seen fit to trust her
 with this.

823
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:52,229
I'm losing it, Jack.

824
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:57,193
Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

825
01:22:57,505 --> 01:23:00,372
Mate, if you choose to love your heart
 away,you'll lose it for certain.

826
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:04,444
If I might lend a machete to your
intellectual thicket,

827
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,344
why, the choice is all to give up.

828
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:09,372
Changes effects.

829
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:14,254
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

830
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:16,379
Who?

831
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:22,263
You.

832
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:27,301
Death has a curious way of reshuffling
one's priorities.

833
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:31,428
I'll slip aboard the Dutchman,find the
heart, stab the beating thing

834
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:34,465
you're free to be with your charming
murderess.

835
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:38,468
And you're willing to cut out your heart
 and bind yourself to the Dutchman

836
01:23:39,301 --> 01:23:40,127
Forever?

837
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:43,410
No, mate. I'm free forever.

838
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:47,286
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map Free from death itself.

839
01:23:47,943 --> 01:23:49,544
You'll have to do the job though, Jack.

840
01:23:50,305 --> 01:23:52,480
You'll have to ferry souls
to the next world.

841
01:23:53,772 --> 01:23:55,348
Or end up just like Jones.

842
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:00,331
I don't have the face for tentacles.

843
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:04,338
But a mortal has to care for 
something, aye?

844
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,477
What's this for?

845
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:12,278
A thing like me. It'll come to you.

846
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:27,454
My regards to Davy Jones!

847
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:35,401
I hate him!

848
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:41,239
Come with me.

849
01:24:44,439 --> 01:24:45,297
Quickly!

850
01:25:24,614 --> 01:25:25,762
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove.

851
01:25:26,437 --> 01:25:27,997
Beckett knows of the meeting
of the Brethren.

852
01:25:28,309 --> 01:25:29,902
I fear there may be a traitor
among them.

853
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:33,291
It's too late to own my forgiveness.

854
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:37,455
I had nothing to do with your father's
death.

855
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:42,269
That does not absolve me 
of my other sins.

856
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:47,497
Come with us.

857
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,269
James, come with me.

858
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:55,516
Who goes there?

859
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:00,351
Go!

860
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:02,323
I will follow.

861
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:03,481
You're lying.

862
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:10,263
Our destinies have been
entwined, Elizabeth

863
01:26:10,298 --> 01:26:13,267
but never joined.

864
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:21,397
Go now!

865
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:29,440
Back to your station, sailor.

866
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,378
No one leaves the ship.

867
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:37,256
Stand down. That's an order.

868
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:38,447
That's an order?

869
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:42,884
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

870
01:26:43,613 --> 01:26:44,729
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

871
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:46,648
Part of the crew, part of the ship!
- Steady, man!

872
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:51,234
Part of the crew, part of the ship!
Who runs? Prisoner escapes!

873
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,237
Relay that!

874
01:26:53,272 --> 01:26:54,005
James!
