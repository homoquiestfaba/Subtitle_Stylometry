far away....</font>

3
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,035
- Mama.
- We know.

4
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,435
Jyn, gather your things, it's time.

5
00:01:43,678 --> 00:01:44,576
Hello.

6
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:46,686
Saw, it's Lyra.

7
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:48,129
It's happened.

8
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:49,738
He's come for us.

9
00:01:49,763 --> 00:01:51,389
You know what to do.

10
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:10,463
Jyn, come here.

11
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:13,201
Remember, whatever I do,

12
00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:15,359
I do it to protect you.

13
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:17,218
Say you understand.

14
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:19,474
I understand.

15
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:26,864
- I love you, Stardust.
- I love you too, Papa.

16
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:28,373
Galen.

17
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:32,742
Go.

18
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,903
Jyn.

19
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,866
You know where to go, don't you?

20
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:05,484
Trust the force.

21
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:41,641
You're a hard man to find, Galen.
But farming?

22
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:45,336
Really, a man of your talents?

23
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:47,725
It's a peaceful life.

24
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:50,603
It's lonely, I imagine.

25
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:55,514
Since Lyra died, yes.

26
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:57,336
Oh.

27
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,463
Oh.

28
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:08,102
My condolences.

29
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:11,027
Search the house!

30
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:12,633
Understood.

31
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:21,394
What is it you want?

32
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:24,843
The work has stalled,
I need you to come back.

33
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:26,747
I won't do it, Krennic.

34
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:30,362
We're on the verge of greatness.
We were this close

35
00:04:30,388 --> 00:04:33,961
to providing peace,
security for the galaxy.

36
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:36,140
You're confusing peace with terror.

37
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:37,536
Do I, huh?

38
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:39,684
You have to start somewhere.

39
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:48,002
I'll be of no help, Krennic.

40
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:50,831
My mind just isn't
what it was.

41
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:53,098
I have trouble remembering,

42
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,749
even simple things.

43
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:57,729
Galen,

44
00:04:57,989 --> 00:05:01,784
you're an inspired scientist
but you're a terrible liar.

45
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,754
Now I admire the effort,
I really do.

46
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:10,190
Oh look, here's Lyra back from the dead.
It's a miracle.

47
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:14,543
Stop!

48
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:21,085
Oh, Lyra.
Troublesome as ever.

49
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,290
You're not taking him.

50
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:25,473
No, of course I'm not.
I'm taking you all.

51
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:27,362
You'll all come.
You, your child,

52
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:30,188
- You'll all live in comfort.
- As hostages.

53
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:33,682
As 'heroes of the Empire.'

54
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:35,460
Lyra.

55
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,391
Put it down.

56
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:40,532
Think very carefully.

57
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:50,314
- You will never win.
- Do it.

58
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:53,577
Lyra!

59
00:05:54,273 --> 00:05:55,698
No!

60
00:05:58,137 --> 00:06:00,116
They have a child.

61
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:02,088
Find it!

62
00:07:31,672 --> 00:07:33,334
My child.

63
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:35,867
Come.

64
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:38,663
Come.

65
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:42,659
We have a long ride
ahead of us.

66
00:07:44,082 --> 00:07:53,751
<font color="#ffff80">ROGUE ONE</font>

67
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:24,519
Check in, security.
Cell block 4227

68
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:27,660
4227

69
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:31,473
- I was about to leave.
- I came as fast as I could.

70
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:32,801
I have to get back on board.

71
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:34,544
- Walk with me.
- Back to Jedha?

72
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:35,957
They'll leave without me!

73
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:39,158
Easy. You have news from Jedha?
Come on.

74
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:45,679
An Imperial pilot, one of the cargo drivers.
He defected yesterday.

75
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:47,862
He's telling people
they're making a weapon.

76
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,885
The kyber crystals,
that's what they're for.

77
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,928
What kind of weapon?

78
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:53,418
- Look, I have to go.
- What kind of weapon?

79
00:09:53,443 --> 00:09:56,467
A planet killer.
That's what he called it.

80
00:09:56,492 --> 00:09:58,203
A planet killer?

81
00:09:58,228 --> 00:10:00,145
Someone named Erso sent him.

82
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,916
- Some old friend of Saw's.
- Galen Erso?

83
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,884
- Was it?
- I don't know! They were looking for Saw when we left.

84
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:08,818
- Who else knows this?
- I have no idea!

85
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:10,810
It's all falling apart.

86
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:14,748
Saw's right, there're spies everywhere

87
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,317
What's all this?

88
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:19,367
Come on, let's see some scandocs.

89
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:22,175
Yeah, of course.
My gloves?

90
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:27,491
No…

91
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:29,182
What've you done?

92
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:32,281
Troopers down, section 9.

93
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:34,117
Are you crazy?

94
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:36,637
I'll never climb out of here.
My arm...

95
00:10:36,662 --> 00:10:39,106
Get out of the way.
Move! Move!

96
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:43,110
Calm down.
Calm down.

97
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:45,351
We'll be all right.

98
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:33,097
Is that him?

99
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,723
He looks kind of different

100
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,649
than I imagined.

101
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:45,116
Okay,
so you're-you're Saw Gerrera?

102
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:48,073
Saw Gerrera.
No?

103
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:50,536
Okay, we're just wasting
time that we don't have.

104
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:54,365
I need to speak to Saw Gerrera!
I keep telling them before, before it's too late.

105
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,874
We're out here in the middle of nowhere.
We need to get to Jedha City.

106
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,336
What part of urgent message
do you guys not understand?

107
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,001
Hey!

108
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:09,375
we're all on the same side, if you just
see past the uniform for a minute…

109
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,490
I've got to speak to ah...
I've got to speak to Saw Gerrera.

110
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:53,751
What now?

111
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:56,868
I don't know.
Must be another pick up.

112
00:12:57,628 --> 00:12:59,744
I thought we had everybody.

113
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:08,622
-All clear, sir.
- Hallik!

114
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:11,124
- Liana Hallik!
- Her.

115
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:13,543
You want to get out of here?

116
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:16,552
Hey!
What about me?

117
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:33,623
Congratulations.
You are being rescued

118
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:36,218
Please do not resist.

119
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,994
LU-28, report to maintenance level 4.

120
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:15,339
You're currently calling yourself Liana Hallik.
Is that correct?

121
00:14:16,028 --> 00:14:19,761
Possession of unsanctioned weapons,
forgery of Imperial documents,

122
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:24,488
aggravated assault,
escape from custody, resisting arrest…

123
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:30,446
Imagine if the Imperial authorities had
found out who you really were. Jyn Erso?

124
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:33,628
That's your given name, is it not?

125
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:37,771
Jyn Erso?
Daughter of Galen Erso.

126
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:41,261
A known Imperial collaborator
in weapons development.

127
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,438
What is this?

128
00:14:46,476 --> 00:14:48,883
It's a chance for you
to make a fresh start.

129
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:51,312
We think you might be
able to help us.

130
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:54,711
This is Captain Cassian Andor,
Rebel Intelligence.

131
00:14:56,368 --> 00:14:59,774
When was the last time you were
in contact with your father?

132
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:02,865
15 years ago.

133
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,857
Any idea where he's been
all that time?

134
00:15:08,652 --> 00:15:11,236
I like to think he's dead,
makes things easier.

135
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:14,920
Easier than what? That he's being a tool
of the Imperial war machine?

136
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:18,909
- I've never had the luxury of political opinions.
- Really?

137
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,914
When was your last contact
with Saw Gerrera?

138
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:30,630
It's been a long time.

139
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:33,874
He'd remember you, though,
wouldn't he?

140
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,269
He might agree to meet you,
if you came as a friend.

141
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:40,233
We're up against the clock here, girl,
So if there's nothing to talk about,

142
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:42,888
we'll just put you back
where we found you.

143
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:44,785
I was a child, Saw Gerrera saved my life.

144
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,661
He raised me. But I've no idea where he is.
 I haven't seen him in years.

145
00:15:47,686 --> 00:15:50,522
We know how to find him,
that's not our problem.

146
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:54,599
What we need is someone who gets us
through the door without being killed.

147
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:57,358
You're all rebels, aren't you?

148
00:15:57,383 --> 00:16:00,452
Yes, but Saw Gerrera's an extremist.

149
00:16:00,532 --> 00:16:03,574
He's been fighting on his own
since he broke with the Rebellion.

150
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:08,199
His militancy has caused the Alliance
a great many problems.

151
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:13,464
We have no choice now but to try
to mend that broken trust.

152
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,938
What does this have
to do with my father?

153
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,883
There's an Imperial defector in Jedha.
A pilot.

154
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:26,790
He's being held by Saw Gerrera.

155
00:16:26,815 --> 00:16:32,970
He's claiming the Emperor is creating a weapon
with the power to destroy entire planets.

156
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:39,083
The pilot says he was
sent by your father.

157
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:43,140
We need to stop this
weapon before it is finished.

158
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:47,481
Captain Andor's mission is to authenticate
the pilot's story and then, if possible, find your father.

159
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,181
It appears he is critical to the
development of this superweapon.

160
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:54,919
Given the gravity of the situation
and your history with Saw,

161
00:16:54,944 --> 00:16:59,812
we're hoping that he will help us locate your father
and return him to the Senate for testimony.

162
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:10,778
And if I do it?

163
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:13,149
We'll make sure you go free.

164
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:34,773
Captain Andor!

165
00:17:45,844 --> 00:17:47,982
I'm Kay-Tuesso (K-2SO)

166
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:52,730
I'm a reprogrammed Imperial droid.

167
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:54,219
I remember you.

168
00:17:54,252 --> 00:17:57,995
I see the Council is sending you
with us to Jedha.

169
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,426
Apparently so.

170
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:03,404
That is a bad idea.

171
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:06,485
I think so, and so does Cassian.

172
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,384
What do I know?
My specialty is just strategic analysis.

173
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:17,382
Galen Erso is vital to the
Empire's weapon program.

174
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:20,342
Forget what you heard in there,
there will be no extraction.

175
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:23,792
You find him,
you kill him.

176
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,484
Then and there.

177
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,607
You met Kay-Tu?

178
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:39,086
Charming.

179
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:42,291
He tends to say whatever
comes into his circuits.

180
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:45,196
 It's a by-product of the reprogram.

181
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:47,900
Why does she get a blaster,
and I don't?

182
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,198
- What.
- I know how to use it.

183
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:54,108
That's what I'm afraid of.
Give it to me.

184
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,495
We're going to Jedha.
That's a war zone.

185
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:02,160
That's not the point.

186
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:04,507
- Where did you get it?
- I found it.

187
00:19:04,532 --> 00:19:07,574
I find that answer
vague and unconvincing.

188
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,811
Trust goes both ways.

189
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,485
You're letting her keep it?

190
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:26,011
Would you like to know the probability
of her using it against you?

191
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:31,472
- It's high.
- Let's get going.

192
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:33,387
It's very high.

193
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:14,761
Lies!

194
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:18,942
Deceptions!

195
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,517
Let's see it.

196
00:20:26,443 --> 00:20:30,176
Bodhi Rook.
Cargo pilot.

197
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:32,830
- Local boy, huh?
- Uh-huh.

198
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:38,499
Okay, I can hear you.

199
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:39,956
He didn't capture me,
I came here myself.

200
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:41,595
I defected, I defected.

201
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,295
Every day, more lies.

202
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:46,734
Lies?

203
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:49,288
Would I risk everything for a lie?
No, we don't have time for this!

204
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:51,912
I have to speak to Saw Gerrera
before it's too late.

205
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:57,689
Okay...

206
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,854
So, you...

207
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:03,762
Um.

208
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:06,668
Uh.
That's-That's for you.

209
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:11,401
And I gave it to them,
they did not find it!

210
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,957
I gave it to them.

211
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,713
Galen Erso.

212
00:21:18,598 --> 00:21:20,437
He told me to find you.

213
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,440
Bor Gullet.

214
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,411
Bor Gullet?

215
00:21:47,534 --> 00:21:49,551
Galen Erso sent me!

216
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:51,708
He told me to find you!

217
00:22:22,804 --> 00:22:26,589
Most unfortunate about the security breach
on Jedha, Director Krennic.

218
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:30,727
After so many setbacks and delays,
and now this.

219
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:39,252
We've heard word of rumors
circulating through the city.

220
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:43,410
Apparently you've lost
a rather talkative cargo pilot.

221
00:22:43,435 --> 00:22:47,441
If the Senate gets wind of our project,
countless systems will flock to the Rebellion.

222
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:53,369
When the battle station is finished, Governor Tarkin,
the Senate will be of little concern.

223
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:58,881
When has become now, Director Krennic.
The Emperor will tolerate no further delay,

224
00:22:59,251 --> 00:23:02,856
you have made time
an ally of the Rebellion.

225
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:09,883
I suggest, we solve both problems simultaneously
with an immediate test of the weapon.

226
00:23:12,336 --> 00:23:17,899
Failure will find you explaining why
to a far less patient audience.

227
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:20,772
I will not fail.

228
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:01,948
What's the matter, Jyn?
You looked frightened.

229
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,714
I'll always protect you.

230
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,992
Stardust.

231
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:16,030
Don't ever change.

232
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:20,608
Trust...

233
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,619
Galen.

234
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:39,760
We're coming into orbit.
You have controls.

235
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,436
That's Jedha.

236
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:56,806
Or what's left of it.

237
00:24:58,321 --> 00:25:01,474
We find Saw,
we find your father.

238
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:47,512
What's with the Destroyer?

239
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:50,823
It's because of your old friend, Saw Gerrera.

240
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,594
He's been attacking the cargo shipments.

241
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:56,126
What are they bringing in?

242
00:25:57,411 --> 00:25:59,589
It's 'what are they taking out?'

243
00:26:01,523 --> 00:26:04,030
Kyber crystal.
All they can get.

244
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:07,444
We wondered why they were
stripping the temple, now we know.

245
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:09,809
It's the fuel for the weapon.

246
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,140
The weapon your father's building.

247
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:15,627
Maybe we should leave
target practice behind.

248
00:26:16,044 --> 00:26:17,877
Are you talking about me?

249
00:26:17,902 --> 00:26:19,711
She's right.

250
00:26:19,736 --> 00:26:21,985
We need to blend in.
Stay with the ship.

251
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,614
I can blend in.
I'm an Imperial droid.

252
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:27,395
This city is under Imperial occupation

253
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,671
Half the people here want to reprogram you.
The other half want to put a hole in your head.

254
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:34,625
I'm surprised you're so concerned
with my safety.

255
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:39,969
I'm not. I'm just worried
they might miss you and hit me.

256
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:47,064
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

257
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:11,526
Bor Gullet can feel your thoughts,

258
00:27:14,322 --> 00:27:18,153
No lie is safe.

259
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:27,485
What have you really
brought me, cargo pilot?

260
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,896
Bor Gullet will know the truth.

261
00:27:35,224 --> 00:27:37,261
The unfortunate side effect,

262
00:27:37,286 --> 00:27:42,513
- is that one tends to lose one's mind.
- No.

263
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,103
Hey, you just watch yourself.

264
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:19,002
No, no.
Tourist, we don't want any trouble, sorry.

265
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,017
Come on.
Come on.

266
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:23,056
Citizens of Jedha,

267
00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:28,061
you must come forward with information
of the location of this missing cargo pilot.

268
00:28:28,324 --> 00:28:32,355
A reward of 600 credits for the
information shall be awarded.

269
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,429
I had a contact,
one of Saw's rebels,

270
00:28:36,036 --> 00:28:40,119
but he's just gone missing.
His sister will be looking for him.

271
00:28:40,731 --> 00:28:43,810
The temple's been destroyed
but she'll be there waiting.

272
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:47,350
We'll give her your name and hope
that gets us a meeting with Saw.

273
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,861
Hope?

274
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,719
Yeah.
Rebellions are built on hope.

275
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:55,379
Hands where I can see them.
Get over there.

276
00:28:55,404 --> 00:28:58,307
Show me some identification.
Check inside.

277
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,881
Is this all because of your pilot?

278
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:08,741
May the Force of others be with you.

279
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,676
- May the Force of others be with you.
- Wait for me.

280
00:29:12,363 --> 00:29:14,754
May the Force of others be with you.

281
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,996
May the Force of others be with you.

282
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:21,581
Would you trade that necklace
for a glimpse into your future?

283
00:29:23,647 --> 00:29:26,684
Yes, I'm speaking to you.

284
00:29:33,986 --> 00:29:35,982
I am Chirrut Îmwe.

285
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:39,648
How did you know
I was wearing a necklace?

286
00:29:39,673 --> 00:29:41,871
For that answer you must pay.

287
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:47,974
What do you know of kyber crystals?

288
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:52,849
My father, he said they powered
the Jedi lightsabers.

289
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:57,263
Jyn.
Come on, let's go.

290
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,677
The strongest stars have hearts of kyber.

291
00:30:07,064 --> 00:30:08,410
Let's go.

292
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,151
We're not here to make friends.

293
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:16,039
Who are they?

294
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,792
The Guardians of the Whills.

295
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:20,270
Protectors of the Kyber Temple.

296
00:30:20,295 --> 00:30:25,377
But there's nothing left to protect, so
now they're just causing trouble for everybody.

297
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:28,983
You seem awfully tense all of a sudden.

298
00:30:29,008 --> 00:30:33,513
We have to hurry.
This town—it's ready to blow.

299
00:30:34,296 --> 00:30:36,705
Citizens of the Empire,

300
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,024
Imperial forces...

301
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:06,984
Tell me you have a backup plan.

302
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:13,782
Incoming.

303
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,358
Put your guns down.

304
00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:18,050
Behind us.

305
00:31:28,783 --> 00:31:30,951
Looks like we found Saw's rebels.

306
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,453
Jyn, no!

307
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:54,684
Thank you.

308
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,528
Hit the tower.

309
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,246
Get out of there!

310
00:32:28,962 --> 00:32:31,502
Quickly, the kyber, get it.

311
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,367
Here, take the kyber.

312
00:32:35,392 --> 00:32:37,082
Take the kyber.

313
00:32:39,264 --> 00:32:40,615
Come on!

314
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,733
This way!

315
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:29,616
Did you know that wasn't me?

316
00:33:30,702 --> 00:33:31,634
Of course!

317
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:33,932
I thought I told
you to stay on the ship

318
00:33:33,957 --> 00:33:38,487
You did, but I thought it was boring,
and you were in trouble.

319
00:33:40,138 --> 00:33:43,034
There are a lot of explosions
for two people blending in.

320
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:44,474
Freeze right there...

321
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:49,737
You're right,
I should just wait on the ship.

322
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:03,705
Halt!
Stop right there!

323
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:08,850
Where are you taking these prisoners?

324
00:34:09,537 --> 00:34:11,971
- These are prisoners.
- Yes. Where are you taking them?

325
00:34:12,004 --> 00:34:16,733
I am taking them... to imprison them.
In prison.

326
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:19,119
- He's taking us to...
- Quiet!

327
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:21,584
And there's a fresh one
if you mouth off again!

328
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:22,790
- We'll take them from here.
- That's okay.

329
00:34:22,815 --> 00:34:25,814
If you could just point me in the right direction,
I can take them, I'm sure.

330
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,479
- I've taken them this far—
- Hey, wait a second.

331
00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:28,659
- Take them away.
- Wait!
- Hey, droid.

332
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:30,233
You can't take them away!

333
00:34:30,258 --> 00:34:33,489
You stay here.
We need to check your diagnostics.

334
00:34:33,514 --> 00:34:34,890
Diagnostics?

335
00:34:34,915 --> 00:34:38,010
I'm capable of running my own diagnostics,
thank you very much.

336
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,239
Let them pass in peace!

337
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:47,741
Let them pass in peace.

338
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:52,965
The Force is with me,
and I am with the Force.

339
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:57,431
And I fear nothing,
for all is as the Force wills it.

340
00:34:57,456 --> 00:34:59,493
Hey!
Stop right there!

341
00:34:59,518 --> 00:35:00,658
He's blind.

342
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:04,248
Is he deaf?
I said: Stop right there!

343
00:35:18,122 --> 00:35:19,682
Is your foot all right?

344
00:35:53,074 --> 00:35:54,812
You almost shot me.

345
00:35:54,837 --> 00:35:56,644
You're welcome.

346
00:36:00,714 --> 00:36:02,576
Clear of hostiles!

347
00:36:02,957 --> 00:36:04,910
- One hostile!
- He's with us!

348
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:06,734
They're all right.

349
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,567
Thanks.

350
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,947
Cassian, I'm sorry about the slap.

351
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:22,290
Go back to the ship.
Wait for my call.

352
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:26,493
Is he a Jedi?

353
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,296
There are no Jedi here anymore.

354
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:31,013
Only dreamers like this fool.

355
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:32,638
The Force did protect me.

356
00:36:32,663 --> 00:36:34,046
I protected you.

357
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:36,258
Can you get us to Saw Gerrera?

358
00:36:44,046 --> 00:36:47,237
Can't you see
we are no friends of the Empire?

359
00:36:50,796 --> 00:36:54,357
Anyone who kills me or my friends
will answer to Saw Gerrera,

360
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:59,704
Because I am the daughter of Galen Erso.

361
00:37:04,412 --> 00:37:07,650
Are you kidding me?
I'm blind!

362
00:38:44,014 --> 00:38:47,643
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

363
00:38:47,668 --> 00:38:50,278
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

364
00:38:50,303 --> 00:38:51,349
You pray?

365
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:53,701
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

366
00:38:53,726 --> 00:38:54,801
Really?

367
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:57,054
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

368
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:59,412
He's praying for the door to open.

369
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:02,559
It bothers him,
because he knows it is possible.

370
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:08,598
Baze Malbus was once
the most devoted Guardian of us all.

371
00:39:09,207 --> 00:39:12,655
I'm beginning to think the Force
and I have different priorities.

372
00:39:12,681 --> 00:39:16,145
Relax, Captain.
We've been in worse cages than this one.

373
00:39:16,364 --> 00:39:18,504
This is a first for me.

374
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:22,755
There is more than
one sort of prison, Captain,

375
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,721
I sense that you carry yours
wherever you go.

376
00:39:44,892 --> 00:39:46,500
Jyn.

377
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:50,142
Is it really you?

378
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,833
I can't believe it.

379
00:39:54,213 --> 00:39:56,582
Must be quite a surprise.

380
00:39:56,607 --> 00:40:00,943
Are we not still friends?

381
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:03,448
The last time I saw you, you gave me
a knife and loaded blaster

382
00:40:03,473 --> 00:40:05,998
and told me to wait
in a bunker until daylight.

383
00:40:06,023 --> 00:40:08,082
I knew you were safe.

384
00:40:08,361 --> 00:40:10,226
You left me behind.

385
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:12,412
You were already
the best soldier in my cadre.

386
00:40:12,437 --> 00:40:14,481
- I was sixteen.
- I was protecting you!

387
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:15,669
You dumped me!

388
00:40:15,694 --> 00:40:19,460
You were the daughter
of an Imperial science officer!

389
00:40:19,832 --> 00:40:22,078
People were starting to figure that out.

390
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:26,596
People who wanted to-
to use you as a hostage.

391
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:33,959
Not a day goes by
that I don't think of you…

392
00:40:37,956 --> 00:40:42,813
But today, of all days?

393
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:50,872
It's a trap, isn't it?

394
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:52,681
What?

395
00:40:52,706 --> 00:40:54,266
The pilot!

396
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:57,558
The message.
All of it.

397
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:11,867
Did they...

398
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,142
send you?

399
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:21,574
Did you come here to kill me?

400
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:25,003
There's not much of me left.

401
00:41:25,028 --> 00:41:27,309
The Alliance wants my father.

402
00:41:27,535 --> 00:41:30,226
They think he's sent you
a message about a weapon.

403
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:33,985
I guess they think by sending me
you might actually help them out.

404
00:41:36,737 --> 00:41:40,485
So what is it that you want, Jyn?

405
00:41:42,514 --> 00:41:44,981
They wanted an introduction,
they've got it.

406
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:48,571
I'm out now.
The rest of you can do what you want.

407
00:41:49,111 --> 00:41:52,069
You care not about the cause?

408
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:54,037
The cause?

409
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:55,615
Seriously?

410
00:41:56,554 --> 00:41:58,544
The Alliance?
The...

411
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:01,343
The rebels? Whatever it is
you're calling yourself these days?

412
00:42:01,368 --> 00:42:03,720
All it's ever brought me is pain.

413
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:10,997
You can stand to see the Imperial flag
reign across the galaxy?

414
00:42:11,022 --> 00:42:13,582
It's not a problem
if you don't look up.

415
00:42:16,883 --> 00:42:19,072
I have something to show you,

416
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:21,481
come.

417
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:40,371
The Emperor is awaiting my report.

418
00:42:40,396 --> 00:42:43,525
One had hoped that he and Lord Vader
might have been here for such an occasion.

419
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:46,216
And I thought it prudent to save
you from any potential embarrassment.

420
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:48,639
Your concern is hardly warranted.

421
00:42:48,664 --> 00:42:51,649
If saying it would only make it so.

422
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:59,433
All Imperial forces, have been evacuated,
and I stand ready to destroy the entire moon.

423
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:02,794
That won't be necessary.
We need a statement, not a manifesto.

424
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:05,584
The Holy City will be
enough for the day.

425
00:43:06,275 --> 00:43:10,096
Target Jedha City,
prepare single reactor ignition.

426
00:43:14,783 --> 00:43:17,256
- Sir, we're in position, ready to...
- Fire!

427
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:20,000
Commence primary ignition.

428
00:43:23,322 --> 00:43:25,387
Who's the one in the next cell?

429
00:43:25,582 --> 00:43:26,836
What?

430
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:28,488
Where?

431
00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:35,311
An Imperial pilot.

432
00:43:35,431 --> 00:43:36,588
- Pilot?
- I'm going to kill Kim!

433
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:37,973
- No, no, No, wait!
- Come here!

434
00:43:37,998 --> 00:43:39,339
NO!

435
00:43:39,364 --> 00:43:41,601
Back off.
Back off.

436
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,990
Okay.

437
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:48,043
Are you the pilot?

438
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:54,628
Hey, hey—are you the pilot?
The shuttle pilot?

439
00:43:54,653 --> 00:43:55,977
Pilot?

440
00:43:56,137 --> 00:43:57,969
What's wrong with him?

441
00:44:00,272 --> 00:44:02,320
Galen Erso.

442
00:44:03,816 --> 00:44:05,706
You know that name?

443
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:09,701
I brought the message, I'm the pilot.

444
00:44:14,854 --> 00:44:16,660
I'm the pilot.

445
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,117
I'm the pilot.

446
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:20,858
Okay, good.

447
00:44:20,883 --> 00:44:23,307
Now where is Galen Erso?

448
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:28,497
Standby.

449
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:36,625
This is the message I was sent.

450
00:44:40,156 --> 00:44:42,829
Saw, if you're watching this,

451
00:44:42,854 --> 00:44:45,753
then perhaps there is a chance
to save the Alliance.

452
00:44:45,778 --> 00:44:50,685
Perhaps there's a chance to explain myself and,
though I don't dare hope for too much,

453
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:53,200
a chance for Jyn,
if she's alive,

454
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:55,351
if you can possibly find her…

455
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:57,632
to let her know that

456
00:44:57,664 --> 00:45:03,217
my love for her has never faded
and how desperately I've missed her.

457
00:45:06,263 --> 00:45:09,367
Jyn, my Stardust,

458
00:45:10,193 --> 00:45:12,877
I can't imagine
what you think of me.

459
00:45:12,902 --> 00:45:16,775
When I was taken,
I faced some bitter truths.

460
00:45:16,812 --> 00:45:20,575
I was told that, soon enough,
Krennic would have you as well.

461
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,925
As time went by,
I knew that you were either dead

462
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,183
or so well hidden that
he would never find you.

463
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:28,594
I knew if I refused to work,

464
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:30,808
if I took my own life,
it would only be a matter of time

465
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:34,730
before Krennic realized he no longer
needed me to complete the project.

466
00:45:34,755 --> 00:45:38,985
So I did the one thing
that nobody expected: I lied.

467
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,892
I learned to lie.

468
00:45:40,917 --> 00:45:45,135
 I played the part of a beaten man
resigned to the sanctuary of his work.

469
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,091
 I made myself indispensable,

470
00:45:47,116 --> 00:45:51,384
and all the while
I laid the groundwork of my revenge.

471
00:45:51,788 --> 00:45:53,917
We call it the Death Star.

472
00:45:53,942 --> 00:45:55,363
There is no better name.

473
00:45:55,388 --> 00:45:59,185
And the day is coming soon
when it will be unleashed.

474
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,053
I've placed a weakness deep within the system.

475
00:46:02,078 --> 00:46:04,997
A flaw so small and powerful,
they'll never find it.

476
00:46:05,021 --> 00:46:07,740
But, Jyn.
Jyn, if you're listening…

477
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:12,733
My beloved, so much of my life
has been wasted.

478
00:46:13,202 --> 00:46:16,759
I try to think of you
only in the moments when I'm strong,

479
00:46:16,783 --> 00:46:19,524
because the pain of not
having you with me…

480
00:46:19,549 --> 00:46:20,997
Your mother.

481
00:46:21,452 --> 00:46:22,815
Our family.

482
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:27,213
The pain of that loss is so overwhelming
I risk failing even now.

483
00:46:27,307 --> 00:46:29,767
It's just so hard
not to think of you.

484
00:46:31,697 --> 00:46:33,669
Think of where you are.

485
00:46:34,852 --> 00:46:36,585
My Stardust.

486
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,140
Saw, the reactor module,
that's the key.

487
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,341
That's the place I've laid my trap.

488
00:46:43,366 --> 00:46:45,841
It's well hidden and unstable,

489
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:49,614
one blast to any part of it
will destroy the entire station.

490
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:51,573
You'll need the plans,

491
00:46:51,598 --> 00:46:54,729
the structural plans for the Death Star
to find the reactor.

492
00:46:54,754 --> 00:46:58,265
I know there's a complete
engineering archive in the data vault

493
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,612
at the Citadel Tower on Scarif.

494
00:47:00,637 --> 00:47:03,799
Any pressurized explosion
to the reactor module will set off

495
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:07,053
a chain reaction that will
destroy the entire station...

496
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:35,301
Go.
Go.

497
00:47:38,736 --> 00:47:40,721
K-2?
K-2, where are you?

498
00:47:40,746 --> 00:47:41,951
There you are.

499
00:47:41,976 --> 00:47:46,803
I'm standing by as you requested.
Although there's a problem on the horizon.

500
00:47:46,945 --> 00:47:49,349
There is no horizon.

501
00:47:49,438 --> 00:47:52,401
Locate our position.
Bring that ship in here now!

502
00:47:52,426 --> 00:47:53,803
Where are you going?

503
00:47:53,828 --> 00:47:55,731
I've got to find Jyn.

504
00:47:55,756 --> 00:47:58,661
- Get the pilot. We need him.
- All right.

505
00:47:58,686 --> 00:48:00,733
I'll get the pilot.

506
00:48:08,472 --> 00:48:09,876
Pilot.

507
00:48:10,952 --> 00:48:12,296
No, no, no.

508
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:15,424
Let's go.

509
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:16,894
Jyn!

510
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,635
We've got to go.

511
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:29,044
I know where your father is.

512
00:48:29,748 --> 00:48:31,425
Go with him, Jyn.

513
00:48:31,627 --> 00:48:33,392
You must go.

514
00:48:34,092 --> 00:48:36,944
- Come with us.
- I will run no longer.

515
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:39,517
- Come on.
- But you must save yourself.

516
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,705
- Come on.
- Go!

517
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,301
There's no time!

518
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:45,735
Save the Rebellion!

519
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,845
Save the dream!

520
00:49:07,475 --> 00:49:10,175
Oh.
It's beautiful.

521
00:49:19,272 --> 00:49:21,507
Chirrut, let's go!

522
00:49:22,494 --> 00:49:25,633
Come on!
Let's get out of here!

523
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,767
Get us out of here!
Punch it!

524
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,767
- I'm not very optimistic about our role.
- Let's not, K

525
00:50:35,608 --> 00:50:37,241
Come on!

526
00:50:41,248 --> 00:50:43,512
- Punch it.
- I haven't completed my calculation.

527
00:50:43,537 --> 00:50:45,604
I'll make them for you.

528
00:51:13,498 --> 00:51:17,122
I believe I owe you
an apology, Director Krennic.

529
00:51:17,147 --> 00:51:20,957
Your work exceeds all expectations.

530
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:25,164
And you'll tell the Emperor as much?

531
00:51:25,189 --> 00:51:28,172
I will tell him his patience with your
misadventures has been rewarded

532
00:51:28,197 --> 00:51:31,543
with a weapon that will bring
a swift end to the Rebellion.

533
00:51:31,568 --> 00:51:35,540
That was only an inkling
of it's destructive potential—

534
00:51:35,565 --> 00:51:38,222
I will tell him, that I will be
taking control over the weapon

535
00:51:38,247 --> 00:51:42,140
I first spoke of years ago…
effective immediately.

536
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:50,724
We stand here amid
my achievement—not yours!

537
00:51:50,749 --> 00:51:56,139
I'm afraid these recent security breaches have
laid bare your inadequacies as a military director.

538
00:51:56,164 --> 00:51:58,633
The breaches have been filled,

539
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:00,865
Jedha has been silenced.

540
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:03,053
You think this pilot acted alone?

541
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:06,906
He was dispatched from
the installation on Eadu.

542
00:52:07,437 --> 00:52:10,383
Galen Erso's facility.

543
00:52:13,571 --> 00:52:15,584
We'll see about this.

544
00:52:19,944 --> 00:52:22,602
A coded message from Captain Andor, sir.

545
00:52:22,627 --> 00:52:25,990
Weapon confirmed.
Jedha destroyed.

546
00:52:26,015 --> 00:52:29,736
Mission target located on Eadu.
Please advise.

547
00:52:29,761 --> 00:52:31,385
Destroyed?

548
00:52:36,243 --> 00:52:37,713
Proceed.

549
00:52:38,598 --> 00:52:41,330
Tell him my orders still stand.

550
00:52:41,355 --> 00:52:45,177
Tell him to proceed with haste
and keep to the plan.

551
00:52:45,202 --> 00:52:47,789
We have no idea what he is
building for the Empire.

552
00:52:47,814 --> 00:52:50,926
We have to kill Galen Erso
while we have the chance.

553
00:53:01,035 --> 00:53:04,001
Baze, tell me.

554
00:53:05,231 --> 00:53:06,831
All of it?

555
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:09,613
The whole city?

556
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:14,568
- Tell me.
- All of it.

557
00:53:22,094 --> 00:53:23,547
Understood.

558
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:33,074
Set a course for Eadu.

559
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,604
Setting course for Eadu.

560
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:36,628
Is that where my father is?

561
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,954
I think so.

562
00:53:38,979 --> 00:53:40,991
So you're Galen's daughter.

563
00:53:41,197 --> 00:53:42,298
You know him?

564
00:53:42,323 --> 00:53:45,104
I'm Bodhi, the pilot.

565
00:53:45,129 --> 00:53:46,568
You brought the message.

566
00:53:46,593 --> 00:53:49,061
Yes, your father...

567
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,800
He said I could get right by myself.

568
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:55,926
He said I could make it right,
if I was brave enough

569
00:53:56,922 --> 00:53:59,110
and listened to what
was in my heart.

570
00:53:59,594 --> 00:54:01,524
Do something about it.

571
00:54:04,338 --> 00:54:06,207
Guess it was too late.

572
00:54:07,115 --> 00:54:08,450
It wasn't too late.

573
00:54:08,475 --> 00:54:11,018
Seems pretty late to me.

574
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:12,424
No.

575
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,205
We can beat the people
who did this.

576
00:54:15,569 --> 00:54:18,945
My father's message, I've seen it.

577
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,658
They call it the Death Star.

578
00:54:22,161 --> 00:54:25,311
But they have no idea
there's a way to defeat it.

579
00:54:25,336 --> 00:54:27,486
You're wrong about my father.

580
00:54:27,826 --> 00:54:31,257
- He did build it.
- Because he knew they'd do it without him.

581
00:54:31,282 --> 00:54:32,791
My father made a choice.

582
00:54:32,816 --> 00:54:35,389
He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion.

583
00:54:35,414 --> 00:54:37,034
He's rigged a trap inside it

584
00:54:37,059 --> 00:54:39,628
That's why he sent you.
To bring that message.

585
00:54:39,653 --> 00:54:41,171
Where is it?

586
00:54:41,196 --> 00:54:42,865
Where's the message?

587
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,967
It was a hologram.

588
00:54:48,346 --> 00:54:50,884
You have that message, right?

589
00:54:56,535 --> 00:54:58,769
Everything happened so fast.

590
00:54:59,855 --> 00:55:01,443
Did you see it?

591
00:55:03,821 --> 00:55:05,699
You don't believe me.

592
00:55:06,818 --> 00:55:08,829
I'm not the one
you've got to convince.

593
00:55:08,854 --> 00:55:10,697
I believe her.

594
00:55:12,236 --> 00:55:13,635
That's good to know.

595
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,574
What kind of trap?

596
00:55:15,826 --> 00:55:17,842
You said your father made a trap.

597
00:55:17,867 --> 00:55:18,861
The reactor

598
00:55:18,886 --> 00:55:20,930
He's placed a weakness there.
He's been hiding it for years.

599
00:55:20,955 --> 00:55:25,309
He said if you can blow the reactor-
the module- the whole system goes down.

600
00:55:26,106 --> 00:55:27,789
You need to send word
to the Alliance.

601
00:55:27,814 --> 00:55:28,846
I've done that.

602
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:31,120
They have to know
there's a way to destroy this thing.

603
00:55:31,146 --> 00:55:34,666
- They have to go to Scarif to get the plans.
- I can't risk sending that.

604
00:55:34,691 --> 00:55:37,252
We're in the heart of Imperial territory.

605
00:55:37,761 --> 00:55:40,285
Then we'll find him.
And bring him back,

606
00:55:41,484 --> 00:55:43,548
and he can tell them himself.

607
00:56:00,928 --> 00:56:03,299
Course set for Eadu, sir.

608
00:56:21,258 --> 00:56:24,064
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

609
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,056
20 egress to the right.

610
00:56:27,127 --> 00:56:28,269
10 degrees up.

611
00:56:28,294 --> 00:56:30,336
No, no, no, lower.
Lower!

612
00:56:30,361 --> 00:56:31,848
Are you sure this is the way?

613
00:56:31,873 --> 00:56:33,991
They have landing trackers.
They have patrol squadrons.

614
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:36,176
You've got to stay in the canyon,
keep it low.

615
00:56:40,445 --> 00:56:42,069
Watch your right!

616
00:56:45,993 --> 00:56:47,900
There's a 26% chance of failure.

617
00:56:47,924 --> 00:56:49,030
How much farther?

618
00:56:49,055 --> 00:56:50,837
I don't know.
I'm not sure, I never really come this way,

619
00:56:50,862 --> 00:56:52,558
but we're close, we're close.
I know that.

620
00:56:52,587 --> 00:56:55,870
- Well, now there's a 35% chance of failure.
- I don't want to know, thank you.

621
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:57,443
I understand.

622
00:56:58,343 --> 00:57:00,596
- Now! Put it down now!
- The wind...

623
00:57:00,637 --> 00:57:03,531
If you keep going, you'll be
right over the shuttle depot.

624
00:57:03,556 --> 00:57:05,126
- Watch out!
- Hey!

625
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:11,313
Hold on tight!
We're coming down hard!

626
00:57:23,165 --> 00:57:25,912
- Try them again.
- I am, sir. We...

627
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:28,701
The signal's gone dead.

628
00:57:30,026 --> 00:57:34,033
Squadron up, target Eadu.

629
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,573
How about now, check stabilizers?

630
00:57:49,304 --> 00:57:51,988
- Bodhi, where's the lab?
- The research facility?

631
00:57:52,013 --> 00:57:53,188
Yeah.
Where is it?

632
00:57:53,213 --> 00:57:54,997
It's just over the ridge.

633
00:57:55,022 --> 00:57:58,254
And that's a shuttle depot straight ahead of us?
You are sure of that?

634
00:57:58,279 --> 00:57:59,197
Yes.

635
00:57:59,222 --> 00:58:02,911
We'll have to hope there's still
an Imperial ship left to steal.

636
00:58:02,936 --> 00:58:04,215
Here's what we're doing.

637
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,288
Hopefully, the storm keeps up
and keeps us hidden down here.

638
00:58:07,313 --> 00:58:09,413
Bodhi, you're coming with me.

639
00:58:09,437 --> 00:58:11,029
We'll go up the ridge
and check it out.

640
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:12,529
I'm coming with you.

641
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:15,259
No, your father's message,
we can't risk it.

642
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:16,636
You're the messenger.

643
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:19,624
That's ridiculous. We all got the message.
Everyone here knows it.

644
00:58:19,649 --> 00:58:23,739
One blast to the reactor module
and the whole system goes down.

645
00:58:23,764 --> 00:58:26,442
That's how you said it.
The whole system goes down.

646
00:58:26,467 --> 00:58:28,654
Get to work fixing our comms!

647
00:58:29,211 --> 00:58:32,611
All I want to do right now is get a
handle on what we're up against.

648
00:58:32,636 --> 00:58:36,968
So, we're going to go very small and very carefully
up the rise and see what's what.

649
00:58:37,506 --> 00:58:39,314
Let's get out of here.

650
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,108
Does he look like a killer?

651
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:57,014
No.
He has the face of a friend.

652
00:58:57,039 --> 00:58:59,036
Who are you talking about?

653
00:58:59,061 --> 00:59:00,995
Captain Andor.

654
00:59:01,343 --> 00:59:04,047
Why do you ask that? What do you mean,
does he look like a killer?

655
00:59:04,072 --> 00:59:08,818
The Force moves darkly near
a creature that's about to kill.

656
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:13,402
His weapon was in the
sniper configuration.

657
00:59:18,249 --> 00:59:20,878
No, no, no...
We got to go up.

658
00:59:20,903 --> 00:59:23,091
You can't see much from down there.

659
00:59:56,146 --> 00:59:57,562
This way.

660
00:59:58,096 --> 01:00:00,144
I'll be right behind you.

661
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,183
Come on.

662
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:20,464
Where are you going?

663
01:00:20,489 --> 01:00:24,636
I'm going to follow Jyn.
Her path is clear.

664
01:00:24,661 --> 01:00:27,786
Alone?
Good luck!

665
01:00:27,811 --> 01:00:30,984
I don't need luck,
I have you!

666
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:41,845
What are they doing?

667
01:00:41,919 --> 01:00:44,930
If Cassian comes back,
we're leaving without them.

668
01:01:03,363 --> 01:01:05,291
You see Erso out there?

669
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,740
We've come too far.

670
01:01:16,745 --> 01:01:18,930
Patience, my friend.

671
01:01:29,204 --> 01:01:30,473
That's him.

672
01:01:30,498 --> 01:01:33,429
That's him, Galen, in the dark suit.

673
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:51,833
Get back down there,
and find us a ride out of here.

674
01:01:51,952 --> 01:01:53,367
What are you doing?

675
01:01:53,392 --> 01:01:55,566
- You heard me.
- You said we came up here just to have a look

676
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:58,346
I'm here, I'm looking.
Go.

677
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:00,549
Hurry!

678
01:02:11,004 --> 01:02:15,664
Excellent news, Galen.
The battle station is complete.

679
01:02:15,689 --> 01:02:17,788
You must be very proud.

680
01:02:18,054 --> 01:02:20,097
Proud as I can be, Krennic.

681
01:02:20,122 --> 01:02:23,007
Gather your engineers,
I have an announcement.

682
01:02:39,379 --> 01:02:42,258
Is that all of them?
- Yes.

683
01:02:47,118 --> 01:02:48,251
Gentlemen.

684
01:02:48,276 --> 01:02:52,314
 One of you betrayed the Empire.

685
01:02:53,495 --> 01:03:00,393
One of you has conspired with a pilot
to send messages to the Rebellion.

686
01:03:00,455 --> 01:03:04,808
And I urge that traitor step forward.

687
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,932
Very well, I'll consider it a group effort, then.

688
01:03:21,824 --> 01:03:23,507
Ready!
- No.
- No, please.

689
01:03:23,532 --> 01:03:25,066
Aim...

690
01:03:25,894 --> 01:03:27,099
- and...
- No, no.

691
01:03:27,124 --> 01:03:31,622
- fire!
- Stop! Stop! Krennic, stop. It was me.

692
01:03:31,647 --> 01:03:33,466
It was me.

693
01:03:43,481 --> 01:03:46,931
They have nothing to do with it.
Spare them.

694
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:13,316
Fire!

695
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,437
How do I know
the weapon is complete?

696
01:04:27,462 --> 01:04:31,757
Let me share with you some details..

697
01:04:45,704 --> 01:04:47,067
Cassian.

698
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:48,583
Cassian, can you hear me?

699
01:04:48,608 --> 01:04:50,035
I'm here.
You got it working.

700
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,222
Affirmative yes, although we have a problem!

701
01:04:52,247 --> 01:04:54,180
There's an Alliance squadron approaching.

702
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,862
- Clear the area!
- No. No, no, no!

703
01:04:55,887 --> 01:04:59,244
Tell them to hold up!
Jyn's on that platform!

704
01:05:01,742 --> 01:05:03,199
Jedha.

705
01:05:03,802 --> 01:05:07,059
Saw Gerrera.
His band of fanatics.

706
01:05:07,084 --> 01:05:12,819
Their Holy City.
The last reminder of the Jedi. Gone.

707
01:05:13,627 --> 01:05:15,431
You'll never win.

708
01:05:15,675 --> 01:05:18,578
Now where have I heard that before?

709
01:05:19,751 --> 01:05:22,039
Relay from Captain Andor.

710
01:05:22,064 --> 01:05:25,379
- General.
- Captain Andor requesting a delay on squadron support.

711
01:05:25,403 --> 01:05:28,325
Alliance forces onsite.
Please confirm.

712
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:30,048
Get the squadron leader on,
Get him on now!

713
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:32,493
They're already engaged, sir.

714
01:05:55,646 --> 01:05:57,056
Dead

715
01:05:57,081 --> 01:05:58,476
No.

716
01:05:58,922 --> 01:06:02,067
Return fire!
To your stations.

717
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:04,478
Get our fighters in the air now!

718
01:06:10,612 --> 01:06:12,376
Father!

719
01:06:46,657 --> 01:06:49,923
- Go, go, go, go.
- Fall back! Fall back!

720
01:06:49,948 --> 01:06:52,853
Director, we need to evacuate.

721
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:06,205
Papa.
Papa, it's me.

722
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:10,829
It's Jyn.

723
01:08:11,263 --> 01:08:12,734
Jyn.

724
01:08:14,282 --> 01:08:15,896
Stardust.

725
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,129
Papa.

726
01:08:18,888 --> 01:08:20,852
I've seen
your message.

727
01:08:20,877 --> 01:08:23,050
The hologram, I've seen it.

728
01:08:23,754 --> 01:08:25,892
It must be destroyed

729
01:08:26,191 --> 01:08:28,397
I know.
I know.

730
01:08:28,869 --> 01:08:30,399
We will.

731
01:08:31,067 --> 01:08:32,563
Jyn.

732
01:08:35,233 --> 01:08:36,977
Look at you.

733
01:08:39,638 --> 01:08:42,180
I've so much to tell you.

734
01:08:52,524 --> 01:08:53,978
Papa.

735
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:56,691
No. No…

736
01:08:56,716 --> 01:09:00,592
Papa…
Papa! Come on.

737
01:09:00,718 --> 01:09:02,384
Over there, take them down.

738
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:06,132
Come on.

739
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:10,296
- Jyn, we've got to go. Come on.
- I can't leave him,

740
01:09:10,321 --> 01:09:12,885
Listen to me.
He's gone.

741
01:09:12,909 --> 01:09:14,492
There's nothing you can do.
Come on.

742
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,447
- I can't leave him.
- Come on!

743
01:09:16,472 --> 01:09:18,574
- Help me.
- Move!

744
01:09:25,377 --> 01:09:26,772
Down!

745
01:09:31,855 --> 01:09:33,352
Come on.
Come on.

746
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,838
Well done.
You're a Rebel now.

747
01:09:59,978 --> 01:10:02,379
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, let's move!

748
01:10:02,404 --> 01:10:04,416
Come on, let's get out of here.

749
01:10:04,441 --> 01:10:06,015
Move, move, move.

750
01:10:06,675 --> 01:10:09,056
Okay, K-2, let's go.

751
01:10:09,128 --> 01:10:10,749
Copy that.

752
01:10:27,928 --> 01:10:32,187
- Ion thrusters low until we cleared the storm.
- Understood.

753
01:10:50,056 --> 01:10:51,975
You lied to me.

754
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:54,116
You're in shock.

755
01:10:54,942 --> 01:10:57,363
You went up there to kill my father.

756
01:10:57,990 --> 01:11:00,245
You don't know
what you're talking about.

757
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:01,911
Deny it

758
01:11:02,437 --> 01:11:05,839
You're in shock,
and looking for someplace to put it.

759
01:11:06,125 --> 01:11:08,717
- I've seen it before.
- I bet you have.

760
01:11:08,742 --> 01:11:10,104
They know.

761
01:11:10,129 --> 01:11:13,749
You lied about why we came here and
you lied about why you went up alone.

762
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:18,825
I had every chance to pull the trigger.
But did I?

763
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:23,229
Did I?

764
01:11:23,254 --> 01:11:24,968
You might as well have.

765
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:28,098
My father was living proof and you put him at risk.

766
01:11:28,123 --> 01:11:30,695
Those were Alliance bombs
that killed him!

767
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:34,820
I had orders!
Orders that I disobeyed!

768
01:11:34,977 --> 01:11:37,723
- But you wouldn't understand that.
- Orders?

769
01:11:37,748 --> 01:11:39,674
When you know they're wrong?

770
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:43,827
You might as well be a stormtrooper.

771
01:11:43,852 --> 01:11:45,733
What do you know?

772
01:11:45,758 --> 01:11:50,157
We don't all have the luxury of deciding when
and where we want to care about something.

773
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:53,327
Suddenly the Rebellion is
real for you?

774
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:55,473
Some of us live it.

775
01:11:55,892 --> 01:11:59,524
I've been in this fight
since I was 6 years old.

776
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:04,793
You're not the only one
who lost everything.

777
01:12:05,906 --> 01:12:10,358
Some of us just decided
to do something about it.

778
01:12:12,092 --> 01:12:14,592
You can't talk your way around this.

779
01:12:18,123 --> 01:12:20,144
I don't have to.

780
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,363
Yavin Four!

781
01:12:25,605 --> 01:12:28,756
Make sure they know we're
coming in with a stolen ship.

782
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,135
Anybody else?

783
01:13:31,208 --> 01:13:37,426
My lord, Director Krennic has arrived.

784
01:14:36,427 --> 01:14:38,978
Director Krennic.

785
01:14:39,658 --> 01:14:41,437
Lord Vader.

786
01:14:42,297 --> 01:14:44,671
You seem unsettled.

787
01:14:44,696 --> 01:14:47,200
No.
Just pressed for time.

788
01:14:47,225 --> 01:14:49,022
There're a great many things to attend
to.

789
01:14:49,047 --> 01:14:51,103
My apologies.

790
01:14:51,128 --> 01:14:54,788
You do have a great
many things to explain.

791
01:14:54,813 --> 01:14:57,540
I've delivered the weapon
the Emperor requested

792
01:14:57,565 --> 01:15:05,744
I deserve an audience to make certain
he understands its remarkable potential.

793
01:15:05,769 --> 01:15:10,240
Its power to create problems
has certainly been confirmed.

794
01:15:10,265 --> 01:15:12,211
A city destroyed.

795
01:15:12,236 --> 01:15:15,655
An Imperial facility openly attacked.

796
01:15:15,771 --> 01:15:19,133
It was Governor Tarkin
that suggested the test.

797
01:15:19,772 --> 01:15:23,797
You were not summoned here to grovel,
Director Krennic.

798
01:15:23,822 --> 01:15:26,763
- No, I...
- There is no Death Star.

799
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:31,641
The Senate has been informed that
Jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster.

800
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:32,891
Yes, my lord.

801
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:36,662
I expect you to not rest until
you can assure the Emperor

802
01:15:36,687 --> 01:15:42,797
that Galen Erso has not compromised
this weapon in any way.

803
01:15:44,492 --> 01:15:47,405
So I'm still in command?

804
01:15:50,728 --> 01:15:53,298
You'll speak to the Emperor about—

805
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:11,701
Be careful not to choke
on your aspirations, Director.

806
01:16:22,296 --> 01:16:25,346
We must scatter the fleet.

807
01:16:25,371 --> 01:16:28,144
We have no recourse but to surrender.

808
01:16:28,441 --> 01:16:33,140
Are we really talking about disbanding
something that we've worked so hard to create?

809
01:16:33,165 --> 01:16:36,459
- We can't just give in.
- We joined an Alliance, not a suicide pact!

810
01:16:36,484 --> 01:16:39,793
- We've only now managed to gather our forces.
- Gather our forces?

811
01:16:39,818 --> 01:16:42,848
General Draven's already blown up
an Imperial base!

812
01:16:42,873 --> 01:16:44,642
A decision needed to be made.

813
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:47,205
If it's war you want,
you'll fight alone!

814
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:49,670
If that's the way it's going,
why have an Alliance at all?

815
01:16:49,695 --> 01:16:52,799
If she's telling the truth,
we need to act now!

816
01:16:52,824 --> 01:16:54,381
Councilors, please!

817
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:59,512
It is simple, the Empire has the means of
mass destruction. The Rebellion does not.

818
01:16:59,537 --> 01:17:01,315
A Death Star, this is nonsense.

819
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:04,427
What reason would my father have to lie?
What benefit would it bring him?

820
01:17:04,452 --> 01:17:08,926
To lure our forces into a final battle.
To destroy us once and for all.

821
01:17:08,951 --> 01:17:12,972
To risk everything, based on what?
The testimony of a criminal?

822
01:17:12,997 --> 01:17:15,957
The dying words of her father,
an Imperial scientist?

823
01:17:15,982 --> 01:17:17,675
Don't forget the Imperial pilot.

824
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:20,965
My father gave his life so that
we may have a chance to defeat this.

825
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:22,229
So you've told us.

826
01:17:22,253 --> 01:17:26,527
If the Empire has this kind of power,
what chance do we have?

827
01:17:26,553 --> 01:17:28,756
What chance do we have?

828
01:17:29,431 --> 01:17:31,840
The question is 'What choice?'

829
01:17:31,865 --> 01:17:35,729
Run? Hide? Plead for mercy?
Scatter your forces?

830
01:17:35,754 --> 01:17:38,527
You give way to an enemy
this evil with this much power

831
01:17:38,552 --> 01:17:41,589
and you condemn the galaxy
to an eternity of submission.

832
01:17:41,614 --> 01:17:43,504
- The time to fight is now!
- Yes.

833
01:17:43,529 --> 01:17:47,554
Every moment you waste is another
step closer to the ashes of Jedha.

834
01:17:48,101 --> 01:17:51,160
- What is she proposing?
- Just let the girl speak!

835
01:17:51,185 --> 01:17:53,669
Send your best troops to Scarif.

836
01:17:56,166 --> 01:17:58,755
Send the whole rebel fleet if you have to.

837
01:17:58,832 --> 01:18:03,069
We need to capture the Death Star plans
if there is any hope of destroying it.

838
01:18:06,389 --> 01:18:12,171
You're asking us to invade an Imperial
installation based on nothing but hope?

839
01:18:13,394 --> 01:18:15,983
Rebellions are built on hope.

840
01:18:17,656 --> 01:18:19,384
There is no hope.

841
01:18:19,409 --> 01:18:21,386
I say we fight.

842
01:18:21,411 --> 01:18:24,530
I say the Rebellion is finished.

843
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:31,001
I'm sorry, Jyn.

844
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:35,002
Without the full support
of the council,

845
01:18:36,282 --> 01:18:38,338
the odds are too great.

846
01:18:57,769 --> 01:19:03,139
General Bendola,
please report to the briefing room.

847
01:19:03,164 --> 01:19:04,626
You don't look happy.

848
01:19:04,651 --> 01:19:07,389
- They prefer to surrender.
- And you?

849
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:10,648
- She wants to fight.
- So do I. We all do.

850
01:19:10,672 --> 01:19:13,121
The Force is strong.

851
01:19:13,302 --> 01:19:15,881
I'm not sure four of us is quite enough.

852
01:19:15,906 --> 01:19:19,044
- How many do we need?
- What are you talking about?

853
01:19:26,446 --> 01:19:28,735
They were never going to believe you.

854
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,006
I appreciate the support.

855
01:19:31,031 --> 01:19:32,520
But I do.

856
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:36,325
I believe you.

857
01:19:41,595 --> 01:19:43,537
We'd like to volunteer

858
01:19:45,608 --> 01:19:47,051
Some of us...

859
01:19:47,392 --> 01:19:49,039
... most of us,

860
01:19:49,605 --> 01:19:53,075
we've done terrible things
on behalf of the Rebellion.

861
01:19:53,689 --> 01:19:58,882
We're spies.
Saboteurs. Assassins.

862
01:20:00,043 --> 01:20:01,956
Everything I did,

863
01:20:02,044 --> 01:20:04,243
I did for the Rebellion.

864
01:20:04,876 --> 01:20:08,705
And every time I walked away from
something I wanted to forget

865
01:20:09,795 --> 01:20:13,536
 I told myself it was for a cause
that I believed in.

866
01:20:14,755 --> 01:20:16,790
A cause that was worth it.

867
01:20:17,766 --> 01:20:20,209
Without that, we're lost.

868
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:23,683
Everything we've done would
have been for nothing.

869
01:20:26,886 --> 01:20:29,967
I couldn't face myself
if I gave up now.

870
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,639
None of us could.

871
01:20:39,406 --> 01:20:41,448
It won't be comfortable.

872
01:20:41,473 --> 01:20:44,379
It'll be a bit cramped,
but we'll all fit.

873
01:20:46,395 --> 01:20:47,985
We could go.

874
01:20:49,777 --> 01:20:51,504
Okay.
Gear up.

875
01:20:51,529 --> 01:20:54,156
Grab anything that's not nailed down.

876
01:20:55,923 --> 01:20:56,971
Go, go, go!

877
01:20:56,996 --> 01:20:58,336
Jyn.

878
01:20:58,951 --> 01:21:00,961
I'll be there for you.

879
01:21:03,121 --> 01:21:05,714
Cassian said I had to.

880
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:14,425
I'm not used to people sticking around
when things go bad

881
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:16,665
Welcome home.

882
01:21:18,715 --> 01:21:22,405
Bravo team to the Intelligence office
for extraction mission report.

883
01:21:40,893 --> 01:21:42,950
May the Force be with us.

884
01:21:48,629 --> 01:21:50,592
Cargo shuttle, read back, please.

885
01:21:50,617 --> 01:21:52,757
What's going on out there?

886
01:21:53,473 --> 01:21:57,895
That ship's off limits. No one is suppose
to be on board until farther instructions.

887
01:21:58,731 --> 01:22:01,309
Yes, yes we are.
Affirmative.

888
01:22:01,334 --> 01:22:05,378
That's an impounded Imperial ship.
What's your call sign, pilot?

889
01:22:05,405 --> 01:22:07,799
- Um.
- We have to go.

890
01:22:07,824 --> 01:22:09,503
It-It's um...

891
01:22:10,109 --> 01:22:13,700
Say something.
Come on.

892
01:22:13,725 --> 01:22:15,178
Rogue...

893
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:18,473
Rogue One.

894
01:22:18,498 --> 01:22:22,103
Rogue One?
There is no Rogue One.

895
01:22:22,128 --> 01:22:24,088
Well, there is now.

896
01:22:24,545 --> 01:22:28,632
- Rogue One, pulling away.
- Pulling away.

897
01:22:42,597 --> 01:22:45,659
Despite what the others say,
war is inevitable

898
01:22:45,684 --> 01:22:47,934
Yes, I agree.
I must return to Alderaan

899
01:22:47,959 --> 01:22:51,438
 to inform my people
that there will be no peace.

900
01:22:51,825 --> 01:22:54,495
We will need every advantage.

901
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:58,977
Your friend, the Jedi.

902
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:02,820
He served me well
during the Clone Wars

903
01:23:02,845 --> 01:23:05,249
and has lived in hiding
since the Emperor's purge.

904
01:23:05,274 --> 01:23:06,917
Yes, I will send for him.

905
01:23:06,942 --> 01:23:09,173
You'll need someone you can trust.

906
01:23:11,017 --> 01:23:13,563
I would trust her with my life.

907
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:16,957
- Captain Antilles, I have a mission for you.
- Senator.

908
01:23:27,076 --> 01:23:30,268
Okay, we're coming in.

909
01:23:30,428 --> 01:23:33,641
There's a planetwide defensive shield
with a single main entry gate.

910
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:37,073
This shuttle should be equipped with
an access code that allows us through.

911
01:23:37,098 --> 01:23:40,574
Assuming, the Empire hasn't
logged it as overdue.

912
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:42,401
And if they have?

913
01:23:43,616 --> 01:23:48,711
Then,they shut the gate and we're all
annihilated in the cold, dark vacuum of space.

914
01:23:49,518 --> 01:23:51,278
Not me,

915
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:54,574
I can survive in space.

916
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:08,213
Okay.
Here it goes…

917
01:24:12,278 --> 01:24:17,085
Cargo shuttle SW-0608
requesting a landing pad.

918
01:24:18,565 --> 01:24:23,043
Cargo shuttle SW-0608,
you're not listed on the arrival schedule.

919
01:24:23,068 --> 01:24:25,217
Acknowledged, Gate Control.

920
01:24:25,242 --> 01:24:28,241
We were rerouted from Eadu Flight Station.

921
01:24:28,266 --> 01:24:31,577
- Transmitting clearance code now.
- Transmitting.

922
01:24:43,677 --> 01:24:47,349
Cargo shuttle SW-0608?

923
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:50,540
-You are cleared for entry.
- Yes!

924
01:24:51,514 --> 01:24:53,164
Impressive.

925
01:24:57,626 --> 01:24:59,539
I'll tell the others.

926
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:02,540
Okay.

927
01:25:19,471 --> 01:25:25,814
SW-0608 clear for landing pad 9.
Acknowledge, please.

928
01:25:25,839 --> 01:25:29,773
SW-0608 proceeding to LP9 as instructed.

929
01:25:29,798 --> 01:25:32,040
The main building down there,
what is it?

930
01:25:32,073 --> 01:25:36,589
That's the Citadel Tower.
They keep all the Imperial structure archives in there.

931
01:25:36,614 --> 01:25:39,081
If the plans are anywhere,
they'll be there.

932
01:25:39,106 --> 01:25:42,117
The dish at the top?
What's it for?

933
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:45,304
I guess it takes a lot of signals
to send those data files out.

934
01:25:47,091 --> 01:25:50,281
Landing track engaged

935
01:25:50,694 --> 01:25:52,634
Landing track locked.

936
01:26:03,731 --> 01:26:05,339
We're landing.

937
01:26:07,442 --> 01:26:09,079
We're coming in!

938
01:26:14,233 --> 01:26:17,642
Saw Gerrera used to say,
One fighter with a sharp stick

939
01:26:17,667 --> 01:26:20,547
and nothing left to lose
can take the day.

940
01:26:23,981 --> 01:26:26,124
They have no idea we're coming.

941
01:26:26,477 --> 01:26:29,036
They have no reason to expect us.

942
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:32,818
If we can make it to the ground,
we'll take the next chance.

943
01:26:33,301 --> 01:26:36,753
And the next.
On and on until we win...

944
01:26:39,066 --> 01:26:41,123
 or the chances are spent.

945
01:26:43,508 --> 01:26:46,127
The Death Star plans are down there.

946
01:26:46,811 --> 01:26:50,347
Cassian, Kay-Tu, and I will find them.

947
01:26:51,863 --> 01:26:54,334
We'll find a way to find them.

948
01:26:55,707 --> 01:27:01,082
Melshi, Pao, Baze, Chirrut,
you'll take main squad,

949
01:27:01,107 --> 01:27:03,123
move east and get wide of the ship.

950
01:27:03,148 --> 01:27:06,098
Find a position between here and the
tower.

951
01:27:06,123 --> 01:27:10,758
Once you get to the best spot,
light the place up.

952
01:27:10,783 --> 01:27:14,141
- Make ten men feel like a hundred.
- All right.

953
01:27:14,502 --> 01:27:17,140
And get those troopers away from us.

954
01:27:17,377 --> 01:27:18,832
What should I do?

955
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:23,226
Keep the engine running.
You're our only way out of here.

956
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:59,194
Cargo shuttle SW-0608,
be prepared to receive inspection team.

957
01:27:59,219 --> 01:28:00,601
Ready?

958
01:28:14,588 --> 01:28:15,376
Hello.

959
01:28:15,401 --> 01:28:19,028
Hey, you're probably looking for a manifest…

960
01:28:19,053 --> 01:28:21,045
That would be helpful.

961
01:28:21,978 --> 01:28:23,613
It's just down here.

962
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:34,938
Director Krennic, we are entering
the Scarif shield gate.

963
01:28:34,963 --> 01:28:37,983
General Ramda has been informed
of your arrival.

964
01:29:01,941 --> 01:29:05,038
Good luck, little sister.

965
01:29:11,048 --> 01:29:13,306
Go!
Go now, you're clear!

966
01:29:13,346 --> 01:29:16,349
All right, let's go.
Come on. Move, move, move.

967
01:29:44,906 --> 01:29:46,532
I have a bad feeling about—

968
01:29:46,557 --> 01:29:47,763
- Kay!
- Quiet.

969
01:29:47,788 --> 01:29:49,078
What?

970
01:30:25,349 --> 01:30:26,660
We need a map.

971
01:30:26,685 --> 01:30:29,628
Well, I'm sure there's one
just lying about.

972
01:30:29,653 --> 01:30:32,118
You know what you have to do.

973
01:31:02,422 --> 01:31:05,808
One per pad. Pick your spot.
We want to draw them out.

974
01:31:05,936 --> 01:31:08,115
I'll call the timing.
Go!

975
01:31:10,646 --> 01:31:11,685
Hey, did you hear the rumors?

976
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:13,742
Yeah, the T-15s have been
marked obsolete.

977
01:31:13,767 --> 01:31:16,147
Oh boy, it's about time for that.

978
01:31:16,469 --> 01:31:18,122
- Hey.
- Watch out.

979
01:31:39,843 --> 01:31:41,289
What the...?

980
01:31:46,044 --> 01:31:48,242
Director, what brings you to Scarif?

981
01:31:48,267 --> 01:31:56,348
Galen Erso, I want every dispatch, every transmission 
he has ever sent called up for inspection.

982
01:31:56,778 --> 01:31:58,198
All of them?

983
01:31:58,223 --> 01:32:00,769
Yes. All of them.

984
01:32:00,794 --> 01:32:02,665
Get started.

985
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:35,597
Kay?

986
01:32:35,622 --> 01:32:40,137
Our optimal route to the data vault 
places only 89 stormtroopers in our path.

987
01:32:40,162 --> 01:32:44,601
We will make it no more than 33% 
of the way before we are killed.

988
01:32:49,589 --> 01:32:51,300
Melshi,
talk to me.

989
01:32:51,325 --> 01:32:54,227
Ready, ready. 
Standing by.

990
01:32:58,734 --> 01:33:00,440
Light it up.

991
01:33:23,471 --> 01:33:28,042
Are we blind?
Deploy the garrison! Move!

992
01:33:46,529 --> 01:33:48,119
Troopers!

993
01:33:48,715 --> 01:33:50,613
Troopers. 
Troopers on the left!

994
01:34:16,485 --> 01:34:19,408
Sir? Scarif base, 
they're reporting a rebel incursion.

995
01:34:19,433 --> 01:34:21,083
I want to speak to Director Krennic.

996
01:34:21,108 --> 01:34:24,105
He's there, sir.
On Scarif.

997
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:27,047
The original plans for
this station are kept there, are they not?

998
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,552
They are.

999
01:34:28,865 --> 01:34:33,050
Prepare for the jump to hyperspace
and inform Lord Vader.

1000
01:34:40,285 --> 01:34:41,555
Can I help you?

1001
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:43,639
That won't be necessary.

1002
01:34:58,155 --> 01:34:59,974
Senator!

1003
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:02,743
Senator.

1004
01:35:02,768 --> 01:35:04,101
Stop right there, Private.

1005
01:35:04,126 --> 01:35:05,831
Let him speak.

1006
01:35:06,502 --> 01:35:10,952
Intercepted Imperial transmission, ma'am.
Rebels on Scarif.

1007
01:35:11,229 --> 01:35:12,838
I need to speak to Admiral Raddus

1008
01:35:12,863 --> 01:35:16,315
He's returned to his ship
He's gone to fight.

1009
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,417
No!

1010
01:35:34,198 --> 01:35:39,005
Attention all flight personnel,
please report to your commanders immediately.

1011
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:43,459
Attention all flight personnel,
please report to your commanders immediately.

1012
01:35:43,484 --> 01:35:46,358
We have been redirected to Scarif.

1013
01:35:46,383 --> 01:35:50,367
Pilots, you'll be briefed by 
you squadron leaders on route.

1014
01:35:50,706 --> 01:35:53,157
May the Force be with you.

1015
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:55,938
Scarif? 
They're going to Scarif?

1016
01:35:55,963 --> 01:36:00,589
- Why does nobody ever tell me anything, Artoo…?
-  Yeah, nobody tells us anything.

1017
01:36:07,201 --> 01:36:10,197
Fall back!
Fall back!

1018
01:36:10,222 --> 01:36:12,384
Keep drawing them out!

1019
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,238
- Go. Go.
- Move. Move.

1020
01:36:17,263 --> 01:36:18,479
Come on, move up!

1021
01:36:18,504 --> 01:36:20,958
Pad 12 report to ground.
Coming at our flank, we're outnumbered.

1022
01:36:20,983 --> 01:36:23,252
Pad 12 team, what's going on down there.
Status, please.

1023
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:25,269
All Pads report in immediately.

1024
01:36:25,294 --> 01:36:27,016
Unknown, we have rebels everywhere.

1025
01:36:27,041 --> 01:36:30,433
We're taking fire, Pad 12, Pad 14
request assistance.

1026
01:36:30,867 --> 01:36:34,597
This is Pad 2, Pad 2. 
I spot 40 rebels heading west on Pad 2.

1027
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:37,106
Get on there, tell him 
pinned down by rebels on Pad 5.

1028
01:36:37,131 --> 01:36:40,097
This is Pad 5, we're being overrun.
Help us!

1029
01:36:40,122 --> 01:36:43,801
Pad 12, Pad 10, Pad 8, please confirm.
Confirm and report.

1030
01:36:43,826 --> 01:36:46,751
Get reinforcements down to 
Pad 5 immediately!

1031
01:36:49,897 --> 01:36:51,949
This is not working, Kay.

1032
01:36:52,684 --> 01:36:54,417
Right hand.

1033
01:37:15,083 --> 01:37:16,410
Baze!

1034
01:37:17,584 --> 01:37:19,102
- Baze! 
- What?

1035
01:37:19,127 --> 01:37:20,554
Run!

1036
01:37:30,182 --> 01:37:31,926
Retreat.
Retreat!

1037
01:37:48,337 --> 01:37:53,495
This is Admiral Raddus of the Rebel Alliance. 
All Squadron leaders report in.

1038
01:37:53,519 --> 01:37:56,173
Admiral, this is Blue Leader standing by.

1039
01:37:56,198 --> 01:37:58,749
This is Gold Leader, standing by.

1040
01:37:58,774 --> 01:38:01,433
This is Red Leader, standing by.

1041
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:03,949
Sir, those are rebel ships.

1042
01:38:03,975 --> 01:38:06,532
Get Admiral Gorin, immediately.

1043
01:38:06,564 --> 01:38:10,539
Director, the rebel fleet,
it's amassing outside the shield.

1044
01:38:12,928 --> 01:38:14,769
Lock down the base. 
Lock down.

1045
01:38:14,794 --> 01:38:16,986
- And close the shield?
- Do it!

1046
01:38:17,050 --> 01:38:21,169
Red and Gold squadron, attack formations.
Defend the fleet.

1047
01:38:21,194 --> 01:38:24,716
Blue squadron, get to the surface
before they closed that gate.

1048
01:38:24,741 --> 01:38:25,858
Copy, your Admiral.

1049
01:38:25,883 --> 01:38:27,341
Blue squadron, on me.

1050
01:38:27,366 --> 01:38:29,390
- Copy, Blue Leader.
- Copy, Blue Leader.

1051
01:38:29,415 --> 01:38:31,197
We won't have long.

1052
01:38:42,204 --> 01:38:45,200
Close the field.
Close it!

1053
01:38:50,154 --> 01:38:52,068
Come on, come on, come on!

1054
01:38:52,093 --> 01:38:53,579
Pull up!

1055
01:39:05,210 --> 01:39:07,927
- Rebel fleet has arrived.
- What?

1056
01:39:07,952 --> 01:39:09,644
There's fighting on the beach,

1057
01:39:09,669 --> 01:39:11,923
they've locked down the base,

1058
01:39:11,948 --> 01:39:14,717
- they've closed the shield gate.
- What does that mean?

1059
01:39:17,334 --> 01:39:18,852
We're trapped?

1060
01:39:19,544 --> 01:39:21,925
We could transmit the plans 
to the rebel fleet.

1061
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:25,553
We'd have to get a signal out
to tell them it's coming.

1062
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:27,881
It's the size of the data files. 
That's the problem.

1063
01:39:27,906 --> 01:39:29,962
They'll never get through.

1064
01:39:30,429 --> 01:39:33,190
Someone has to take 
that shield gate down.

1065
01:39:33,215 --> 01:39:35,411
Bodhi. 
Bodhi, can you hear me?

1066
01:39:35,436 --> 01:39:37,500
Bodhi, tell me you're out there.

1067
01:39:37,816 --> 01:39:39,293
Bodhi!

1068
01:39:39,318 --> 01:39:41,802
Hello, I'm here.
We're standing by.

1069
01:39:41,827 --> 01:39:43,294
They've started fighting,
the base is on lockdown!

1070
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:46,576
I know, listen to me! 
The rebel fleet is up there.

1071
01:39:46,601 --> 01:39:48,474
You've got to tell them to 
blow a hole in the shield gate

1072
01:39:48,499 --> 01:39:50,876
 so we can transmit the plans

1073
01:39:50,901 --> 01:39:55,555
Wait, I can't. I'm not hooked into 
the comm tower. We're not tied in.

1074
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:57,586
It's the only way 
we're getting them out of here.

1075
01:39:57,614 --> 01:40:00,911
Find a way!
Cover our backs.

1076
01:40:02,999 --> 01:40:04,668
You'll need this.

1077
01:40:06,113 --> 01:40:07,936
You wanted one, right?

1078
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:15,149
Your behavior, Jyn Erso, is continually unexpected.

1079
01:40:15,174 --> 01:40:17,558
Jyn.
Come on.

1080
01:40:38,004 --> 01:40:39,842
Fire on my command.

1081
01:40:55,551 --> 01:40:56,927
Look!

1082
01:41:07,303 --> 01:41:09,391
Get ready.
We're going to have to go out there.

1083
01:41:11,903 --> 01:41:13,554
What're you doing?

1084
01:41:13,579 --> 01:41:16,258
They closed the shield gate,
we're stuck here.

1085
01:41:16,283 --> 01:41:18,848
But, the rebel fleet is pulling in.

1086
01:41:18,873 --> 01:41:20,733
We just have to get a signal 
strong enough to get through to them

1087
01:41:20,758 --> 01:41:23,154
and let them know 
we're trapped down here.

1088
01:41:23,179 --> 01:41:25,033
For that, we have to connect to 
the communications tower.

1089
01:41:25,058 --> 01:41:27,369
Now, I can patch us in over here,
the landing pad

1090
01:41:27,394 --> 01:41:30,274
but you have to get on the radio, 
get one of the guys out there to find

1091
01:41:30,299 --> 01:41:32,029
a master switch.

1092
01:41:32,054 --> 01:41:35,982
Get them to activate the connection between
us and that comm tower. Okay.

1093
01:41:36,007 --> 01:41:37,428
Then go!

1094
01:41:40,481 --> 01:41:42,571
What's going on down there, Lieutenant?

1095
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:44,683
Unknown, sir.
We can't raise them.

1096
01:41:44,708 --> 01:41:47,017
All rebel frequencies are blocked.

1097
01:41:47,042 --> 01:41:51,580
Keep trying. Engage those Star Destroyers 
and let's start probing that shield.

1098
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:53,098
Yes, sir.

1099
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:56,156
We're going in.

1100
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,881
Stay with me.

1101
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:42,039
Schematics bank, Data tower two.

1102
01:42:42,064 --> 01:42:44,799
- How do I find that?
- Searching.

1103
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:49,480
I can locate the tape, but you'll need 
the handles for extraction.

1104
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:55,330
What are we supposed to do with these?

1105
01:42:56,864 --> 01:42:58,402
Whoa.

1106
01:43:13,589 --> 01:43:16,071
- Well, finally.
- Wait, stop.

1107
01:43:16,096 --> 01:43:19,375
The rebels! 
They went…over there.

1108
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,897
Kay.
What's going on out there?

1109
01:43:21,922 --> 01:43:23,439
There's one.

1110
01:43:23,516 --> 01:43:24,908
Oh well.

1111
01:43:35,983 --> 01:43:37,345
Come on!

1112
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:46,113
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader,

1113
01:43:46,138 --> 01:43:48,506
we're starting our attack run
on the shield gate.

1114
01:43:48,531 --> 01:43:51,440
Keep it tight and watch out 
for those towers.

1115
01:44:04,843 --> 01:44:07,689
More fighters.
Form up, at 65.

1116
01:44:08,129 --> 01:44:11,048
Sir, enemy fighters coming in.

1117
01:44:17,737 --> 01:44:20,376
Melshi.
Melshi, come in, are you there?

1118
01:44:20,805 --> 01:44:23,060
Bodhi will send a signal from here.
He's patching us in.

1119
01:44:23,085 --> 01:44:25,293
But you guys have to 
open up a line for the tower.

1120
01:44:25,318 --> 01:44:27,026
How?
Please advise.

1121
01:44:27,051 --> 01:44:29,544
There's a master switch to the base 
of the Comm tower.

1122
01:44:29,569 --> 01:44:32,382
Master switch, describe,
what are we looking for?

1123
01:44:32,407 --> 01:44:35,730
What does it look like, the master switch?
Where is it?

1124
01:44:35,755 --> 01:44:38,220
Two wings, reinforce those troops 
on the beach.

1125
01:44:38,245 --> 01:44:41,898
All fighters, on me.
We have to shield them from air attack.

1126
01:44:43,137 --> 01:44:46,267
Troop reinforcements.
Here we go.

1127
01:44:48,090 --> 01:44:51,327
- For Jedha!
- Jedha!

1128
01:44:56,855 --> 01:44:59,261
We have no effect on that shield.

1129
01:44:59,286 --> 01:45:01,637
How much more can that thing take?

1130
01:45:03,267 --> 01:45:06,277
Stick close, Red 5,
where are you going?

1131
01:45:07,337 --> 01:45:09,204
I'm trying to lose them.

1132
01:45:10,173 --> 01:45:12,959
This is Red 5, I need help!

1133
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:20,373
Hyperspace Tracking,

1134
01:45:20,398 --> 01:45:22,351
Navigational Systems.

1135
01:45:22,376 --> 01:45:26,581
Two screens down.
Structural Engineering, open that one!

1136
01:45:28,199 --> 01:45:30,177
I got one on my tail.

1137
01:45:30,359 --> 01:45:31,865
I'm on it.

1138
01:45:45,064 --> 01:45:50,393
“Project code names: 
Stellarsphere. Mark Omega. Pax Aurora…

1139
01:46:01,547 --> 01:46:06,315
War-Mantle. Cluster-Prism. 
Black-Saber.

1140
01:46:07,078 --> 01:46:08,106
What?

1141
01:46:08,131 --> 01:46:09,643
Stardust.

1142
01:46:11,745 --> 01:46:12,903
That's it.

1143
01:46:12,928 --> 01:46:14,583
How do you know that?

1144
01:46:15,261 --> 01:46:17,340
I know because it's me.

1145
01:46:19,494 --> 01:46:22,386
Hey, you.
Identify yourself.

1146
01:46:26,162 --> 01:46:27,572
I can explain.

1147
01:46:28,095 --> 01:46:30,218
Incoming fire, take cover!

1148
01:46:37,648 --> 01:46:40,157
Kay, we need the file for Stardust!

1149
01:46:43,438 --> 01:46:44,971
Stardust.

1150
01:46:48,655 --> 01:46:50,050
That's it.

1151
01:47:11,276 --> 01:47:12,435
Kay.

1152
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:13,738
Climb.

1153
01:47:13,763 --> 01:47:15,342
Climb.

1154
01:47:15,367 --> 01:47:18,800
You can still send the plans to the fleet.

1155
01:47:18,825 --> 01:47:23,766
If they open the shield gate,
you can broadcast from the tower!

1156
01:47:23,838 --> 01:47:26,546
- Locking the bolt door now.
- Kay.

1157
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:27,967
Kay!

1158
01:47:27,992 --> 01:47:29,947
- Good bye.
- Kay!

1159
01:47:46,551 --> 01:47:50,024
Sir, unauthorized access at the data vault.

1160
01:47:50,826 --> 01:47:53,229
- What.
- It's just come in, sir.

1161
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:01,056
Send my guard squadron into battle! 
Two men with me now!

1162
01:48:01,278 --> 01:48:04,069
Get that beach under control!

1163
01:48:05,171 --> 01:48:06,367
Bodhi? 
Are you there?

1164
01:48:06,392 --> 01:48:08,210
Have you got the switch?

1165
01:48:08,299 --> 01:48:12,525
I can't get to the shuttle, 
I can't plug in!

1166
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:14,649
You have to!
They have to hit that gate.

1167
01:48:14,674 --> 01:48:17,701
If the shield's open, 
we can send the plans!

1168
01:48:47,533 --> 01:48:49,528
General, behind you!

1169
01:48:59,853 --> 01:49:01,330
Take them out.

1170
01:49:03,027 --> 01:49:04,547
Step back.

1171
01:49:12,942 --> 01:49:14,972
We're going down!

1172
01:49:20,059 --> 01:49:21,601
Come on!

1173
01:49:22,230 --> 01:49:23,614
Look out.

1174
01:50:23,108 --> 01:50:25,842
Melshi.
Melshi, come in please.

1175
01:50:25,867 --> 01:50:28,983
I'm tied in at my end,
I just need an open line.

1176
01:50:29,008 --> 01:50:30,416
Hang on.

1177
01:50:31,184 --> 01:50:35,614
The master switch,
it's over at that console.

1178
01:50:38,785 --> 01:50:40,299
I'm going!

1179
01:50:49,825 --> 01:50:51,412
I've got it.

1180
01:50:52,924 --> 01:50:54,299
Careful!

1181
01:50:55,309 --> 01:50:56,699
You okay?

1182
01:51:05,288 --> 01:51:06,617
Jyn!

1183
01:51:23,971 --> 01:51:26,415
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1184
01:51:27,609 --> 01:51:28,933
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1185
01:51:28,958 --> 01:51:30,384
Chirrut!

1186
01:51:39,868 --> 01:51:42,337
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1187
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:44,716
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1188
01:51:44,741 --> 01:51:46,928
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1189
01:51:46,953 --> 01:51:49,041
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1190
01:51:49,066 --> 01:51:51,413
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1191
01:51:51,438 --> 01:51:53,899
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1192
01:51:54,203 --> 01:51:56,819
Chirrut, come back!

1193
01:52:06,079 --> 01:52:07,411
Yes!

1194
01:52:11,244 --> 01:52:13,490
Keep going.
Keep going!

1195
01:52:17,259 --> 01:52:18,816
Cassian.

1196
01:52:28,225 --> 01:52:31,883
Chirrut, come!
Come with me!

1197
01:52:35,562 --> 01:52:37,138
Chirrut!

1198
01:52:42,524 --> 01:52:46,106
Chirrut, don't go.
Don't go.

1199
01:52:46,131 --> 01:52:48,496
I'm here.
I'm here.

1200
01:52:48,521 --> 01:52:52,167
It's okay.
It's okay.

1201
01:52:52,959 --> 01:52:55,565
- Look for the Force,
- Chirrut.

1202
01:52:55,736 --> 01:52:59,116
and you will always find me.

1203
01:52:59,636 --> 01:53:01,902
The Force is with me.

1204
01:53:02,179 --> 01:53:04,441
I'm one with the Force.

1205
01:53:04,466 --> 01:53:06,670
The Force is with me.

1206
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:09,092
I'm one with the Force.

1207
01:53:09,117 --> 01:53:11,341
The Force is with me.

1208
01:53:11,476 --> 01:53:14,070
and I'm one with the Force.

1209
01:53:27,341 --> 01:53:30,975
Deflector shield's down to 50%,
we're sustaining heavy damage.

1210
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,846
There's no turning back now,
we have to press the attack.

1211
01:53:40,182 --> 01:53:41,532
Hit that opening.

1212
01:53:41,557 --> 01:53:42,965
We see it, Gold Leader.

1213
01:53:42,990 --> 01:53:44,966
Ion torpedoes away.

1214
01:53:54,664 --> 01:53:57,749
- What's happening?
- We've lost engine power, sir.

1215
01:54:00,188 --> 01:54:02,602
That Star Destroyer is disabled.

1216
01:54:03,976 --> 01:54:06,859
This is Rogue One, calling any 
Alliance ships that can hear me!

1217
01:54:09,019 --> 01:54:11,518
Is there anybody up there? This is Rogue One!
Come in, over.

1218
01:54:11,543 --> 01:54:14,750
This is Admiral Raddus, Rogue One,
we hear you!

1219
01:54:16,465 --> 01:54:18,178
We have the plans!

1220
01:54:18,709 --> 01:54:21,950
They found the Death Star plans. They have 
to transmit them from the communications tower!

1221
01:54:21,975 --> 01:54:25,559
You have to take down the shield gate. 
It's the only way to going to get them through!

1222
01:54:26,545 --> 01:54:29,693
Call up a Hammerhead corvette. 
I have an idea.

1223
01:54:29,718 --> 01:54:33,175
- Standby, Rogue One, we're on it.
- This is for you, Galen,

1224
01:55:01,492 --> 01:55:05,799
The Force is with me.
I'm one with the Force.

1225
01:55:56,441 --> 01:55:58,946
Corvette 5, locked on target.

1226
01:55:59,539 --> 01:56:01,370
Prepare for impact.

1227
01:56:12,941 --> 01:56:15,449
Sublight thrusters, full power!

1228
01:56:51,195 --> 01:56:53,877
<font color="#ff80c0">Reset antenna alignment.</font>

1229
01:56:54,707 --> 01:56:57,381
<font color="#ff80c0">Reset antenna alignment.</font>

1230
01:56:58,165 --> 01:57:00,777
<font color="#ff80c0">Reset antenna alignment.</font>

1231
01:57:01,418 --> 01:57:04,027
<font color="#ff80c0">Reset antenna alignment.</font>

1232
01:57:26,949 --> 01:57:29,516
Reverse engines, full power!

1233
01:57:50,241 --> 01:57:53,554
<font color="#ff80c0">Antenna alignment. 
Ready to transmit.</font>

1234
01:58:27,697 --> 01:58:29,640
Who are you?

1235
01:58:31,091 --> 01:58:33,094
You know who I am.

1236
01:58:35,357 --> 01:58:37,300
I'm Jyn Erso.

1237
01:58:37,325 --> 01:58:39,722
Daughter of Galen and Lyra.

1238
01:58:39,863 --> 01:58:41,350
You've lost.

1239
01:58:41,375 --> 01:58:43,357
Oh, I have, have I?

1240
01:58:43,382 --> 01:58:46,572
My father's revenge.
He built a flaw in the Death Star.

1241
01:58:46,597 --> 01:58:48,524
He put a fuse in the
middle of your machine

1242
01:58:48,549 --> 01:58:51,616
and I've just told the 
entire galaxy how to light it.

1243
01:58:51,641 --> 01:58:56,515
The shield is up, your signal 
will never reach the rebel base.

1244
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:58,875
All you ships in here
will be destroyed.

1245
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:01,243
I lose nothing but time.

1246
01:59:01,268 --> 01:59:06,594
YOU on the other hand
die with the Rebellion.

1247
01:59:36,609 --> 01:59:38,226
<font color="#ff80c0">Transmitting.</font>

1248
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:42,331
<font color="#ff80c0">Transmitting.</font>

1249
01:59:43,333 --> 01:59:47,022
Admiral, receiving transmission from Scarif.

1250
01:59:55,317 --> 01:59:57,994
Hey, leave it.
Leave it.

1251
01:59:58,019 --> 01:59:59,202
That's it.

1252
02:00:00,535 --> 02:00:01,932
That's it.

1253
02:00:03,477 --> 02:00:04,639
Let's go.

1254
02:00:04,664 --> 02:00:06,248
Transmission received.

1255
02:00:06,273 --> 02:00:09,115
Admiral, we have the plans!

1256
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:10,690
She did it.

1257
02:00:11,955 --> 02:00:15,060
Do you think,
anybody is listening?

1258
02:00:15,856 --> 02:00:17,215
I do.

1259
02:00:18,695 --> 02:00:20,612
Someone's out there.

1260
02:00:22,665 --> 02:00:27,211
Sir, we're detecting a massive object
emerging from hyperspace.

1261
02:00:32,872 --> 02:00:34,860
Sir, shall I begin targeting their fleet?

1262
02:00:34,885 --> 02:00:36,832
Lord Vader will handle the fleet.

1263
02:00:36,857 --> 02:00:40,628
Target the base at Scarif.
Single reactor ignition

1264
02:00:40,653 --> 02:00:41,969
Yes, sir.

1265
02:01:11,882 --> 02:01:14,212
You may fire when ready.

1266
02:01:19,012 --> 02:01:21,431
Commence primary ignition.

1267
02:01:42,510 --> 02:01:46,440
Rogue One, may the Force be with you.

1268
02:01:49,823 --> 02:01:53,626
All ships, prepare for jump to hyperspace!

1269
02:02:25,579 --> 02:02:28,604
You father would have been 
proud of you, Jyn.

1270
02:02:42,046 --> 02:02:44,414
The rebel flag ship is disabled, my lord,

1271
02:02:44,439 --> 02:02:47,098
but has received transmission 
from the surface.

1272
02:02:47,123 --> 02:02:49,486
Prepare a boarding party.

1273
02:02:49,511 --> 02:02:50,998
Yes, my lord.

1274
02:03:27,112 --> 02:03:28,551
Hurry!

1275
02:03:31,852 --> 02:03:34,794
 Let go!
 We got to go now.

1276
02:03:37,958 --> 02:03:39,809
Hurry, let's go.

1277
02:03:40,548 --> 02:03:42,008
It's stuck.

1278
02:03:43,955 --> 02:03:45,492
Hey, help!

1279
02:04:02,532 --> 02:04:04,564
Open fire!

1280
02:04:09,713 --> 02:04:11,568
Help us!

1281
02:04:14,601 --> 02:04:16,212
It's jammed.

1282
02:04:23,285 --> 02:04:24,706
Push!

1283
02:04:28,132 --> 02:04:31,691
Here. Here.
Take it! Take it.

1284
02:04:39,031 --> 02:04:41,323
LAUNCH!

1285
02:05:07,499 --> 02:05:11,772
Make sure you secure the airlock.
And prepare the escape pods.

1286
02:05:15,589 --> 02:05:19,131
Your Highness. 
The transmission we received.

1287
02:05:20,116 --> 02:05:22,239
What is it they've sent us?

1288
02:05:23,493 --> 02:05:25,063
Hope.

1289
