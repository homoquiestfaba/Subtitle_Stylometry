2
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,337
Echo Three to Echo Seven.

3
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,339
Han, old buddy, do you read me?

4
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,341
<i>Loud and clear, kid. What's up?</i>

5
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,500
I finished my circle.

6
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,179
I don't pick up any life readings.

7
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,097
<i>There isn't enough life on this ice cube...</i>

8
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,599
<i>to fill a space cruiser.</i>

9
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,517
<i>Sensors are placed. I'm going back.</i>

10
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,352
Right. I'll see you shortly.

11
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,306
There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here.

12
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,646
I want to check it out. It won't take long.

13
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,815
Steady, girl. What's the matter?

14
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,903
You smell something?

15
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,857
Chewie!

16
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,315
Chewie?

17
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,696
Chewie!

18
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,372
All right! Don't lose your temper.

19
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,621
I'll come right back and give you a hand.

20
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,434
Solo?

21
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,806
No sign of life out there, General.

22
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,186
The sensors are in place.

23
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,432
You'll know if anything comes around.

24
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,111
Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

25
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,396
No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.

26
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,571
With all the meteor activity in this system...

27
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,360
it's going to be difficult
to spot approaching ships.

28
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,700
General, I got to leave. I can't stay any more.

29
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,861
I'm sorry to hear that.

30
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,028
Well, there's a price on my head.

31
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,540
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt...

32
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,042
I'm a dead man.

33
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,077
A death mark's not an easy thing to live with.

34
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,587
You're a good fighter, Solo.

35
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,670
I hate to lose you.

36
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,672
Thank you, General.

37
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,802
Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.

38
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,810
That's right.

39
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,354
Well, don't get all mushy on me.

40
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,061
So long, Princess.

41
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,900
Han!

42
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,905
Yes, Your Highnessness?

43
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,026
I thought you had decided to stay.

44
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,117
Well, the bounty hunter we
ran into in Ord Mantell...

45
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,111
changed my mind.

46
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,239
Han, we need you!

47
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,239
<i>We need?</i>

48
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,454
Yes.

49
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,699
<i>Well, what about you need?</i>

50
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:18,998
<i>I need?</i>

51
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,038
I don't know what you're talking about.

52
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,797
You probably don't.

53
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,668
And what precisely am I supposed to know?

54
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,544
Come on!

55
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,920
You want me to stay because
of the way you feel about me.

56
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,715
Yes! You're a great help to us.

57
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,714
You're a natural leader.

58
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,388
No! That's not it.

59
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,894
Come on.

60
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,349
A-ha!

61
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,939
You're imagining things.

62
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,809
Am I? Then why are you following me?

63
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,813
Afraid I was gonna leave without
giving you a goodbye kiss?

64
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,320
I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee!

65
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,822
I can arrange that.

66
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,522
You could use a good kiss!

67
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,324
I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater.

68
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,824
I merely commented that it was
freezing in the princess's chamber.

69
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,330
How will we dry out her clothes?

70
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,004
Oh, switch off!

71
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,624
Why did you take this apart now?

72
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,500
I'm trying to get us out of here,
and you pull both--

73
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,629
Excuse me, sir.

74
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,874
Put them back together now!

75
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:08,793
Might I have a word with you, please?

76
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,877
What do you want?

77
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,341
It's Princess Leia.

78
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,967
She's been trying to get you on the communicator.

79
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,807
I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.

80
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,808
Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke.

81
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,850
He hasn't come back yet.

82
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:18,845
She doesn't know where he is.

83
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:19,846
I don't know where he is.

84
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:20,977
Nobody knows where he is.

85
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,305
What do you mean, nobody knows?

86
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,853
Well, uh, you see--
- Deck Officer!

87
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,563
Deck Officer!
- Excuse me, sir, might I--

88
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,893
Yes, sir?

89
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,310
Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?

90
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,907
I haven't seen him.

91
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,361
It's possible he came through the south entrance.

92
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,358
<i>It's possible?</i>

93
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,118
Why don't you go find out?

94
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,241
It's getting dark out there.

95
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,782
Yes, sir.

96
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,824
Excuse me, sir. Might I enquire what's going on?

97
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,121
Why not?

98
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,449
Impossible man.

99
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,164
Come along, R2, let's find Princess Leia.

100
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,625
Between ourselves...

101
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,795
I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.

102
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,593
Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't
come in the south entrance.

103
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,807
He might have forgotten to check in.

104
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,313
Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

105
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,432
We're having trouble adapting them to the cold.

106
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,811
We'll have to go out on tauntauns.

107
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,485
Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly.

108
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,687
That's right, and my friend's out in it.

109
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,739
Your tauntaun will freeze before
you reach the first marker.

110
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,408
Then I'll see you in hell.  Hyah!

111
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,635
You must come along now, R2.

112
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,755
There's really nothing more we can do.

113
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,178
And my joints are freezing up.

114
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,590
Don't say things like that!

115
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,186
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

116
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,685
And he'll be quite all right.

117
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,680
You'll see.

118
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,643
Stupid little short circuit.

119
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,816
He'll be quite all right.

120
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,286
Sir, all the patrols are in.

121
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,378
Still no--

122
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,342
Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.

123
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,837
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been quite
unable to pick up any signals...

124
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,463
although he does admit that his
own range is far too weak...

125
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,093
to abandon all hope.

126
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,302
Your Highness, there's nothing
more we can do tonight.

127
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,678
The shield doors must be closed.

128
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:12,972
Close the doors.

129
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:13,973
Yes, sir.

130
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:21,022
R2 says the chances of survival are 725 to 1.

131
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:35,788
Actually, R2 has been known to make mistakes...

132
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,715
from time to time.

133
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,302
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

134
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,222
Don't worry about Master Luke.

135
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,726
I'm sure he'll be all right.

136
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,259
He's quite clever, you know, for a human being.

137
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,328
<i>Luke.</i>

138
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,238
<i>Luke.</i>

139
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,294
Ben?

140
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,047
<i>You will go to the Dagobah system.</i>

141
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,922
Dagobah system?

142
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,807
<i>There you will learn from Yoda...</i>

143
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:33,394
<i>the Jedi master who instructed me.</i>

144
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,348
Ben!

145
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,680
Ben!

146
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,362
Luke!

147
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,861
Luke!

148
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,330
Don't do this, Luke.

149
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,874
Come on, give me a sign here.

150
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,727
Not much time.

151
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,270
Ben.

152
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,609
Ben.

153
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,944
Hang on, kid.

154
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,201
Dagobah system.

155
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,279
Whew!

156
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:36,285
This may smell bad, kid...

157
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,375
Yoda.

158
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,163
but it'll keep you warm...

159
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,538
till I get the shelter up.

160
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,129
Ben... Dagobah...

161
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:52,302
I thought they smelled bad on the outside!

162
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,640
Echo Base, I've got something.

163
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,807
Not much, but it could be a life form.

164
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,186
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

165
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,196
This is Rogue Two.

166
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,566
This is Rogue Two.

167
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:55,450
Captain Solo, do you copy?

168
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:04,119
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

169
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,663
This is Rogue Two.

170
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,175
<i>an: Good morning.</i>

171
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,626
<i>Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>

172
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,134
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

173
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,640
I've found them.

174
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,509
Repeat, I've found them.

175
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,258
Master Luke, sir, it's so good to
see you fully functional again.

176
00:16:48,294 --> 00:16:49,456
Master Luke, sir, it's so good to
see you fully functional again.

177
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,458
Thanks, 3PO.

178
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,296
R2 expresses his relief also.

179
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,181
How ya feelin', kid? You don't look so bad to me.

180
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,683
You look strong enough...

181
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,683
to pull the ears off a gundark.

182
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,186
Thanks to you.

183
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,850
That's two you owe me, junior.

184
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,773
Well, Your Worship...

185
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,474
looks like you managed to keep me
around for a little while longer.

186
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,154
I had nothing to do with it.

187
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,988
General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous...

188
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,278
for any ships to leave the system...

189
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:14,688
until we've activated the energy field.

190
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,700
That's a good story.

191
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,156
<i>I think you just can't bear...</i>

192
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,743
to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

193
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:24,159
I don't know where you get
your delusions, laser brain.

194
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,918
Hah hah hah!

195
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,171
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

196
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,668
but you didn't see us alone in the south passage.

197
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,210
She expressed her true feelings for me.

198
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,675
My--

199
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,724
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

200
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,389
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

201
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,557
Who's scruffy-looking?

202
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,191
I must have hit pretty close to the mark...

203
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,312
to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?

204
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,277
Well, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

205
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,667
<i>Headquarters personnel, report to command center.</i>

206
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,715
<i>Headquarters personnel, report to command center.</i>

207
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:14,792
Take it easy.

208
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,300
Excuse us, please.

209
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,301
Princess, we have a visitor.

210
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,804
Picked up something outside the
base's Zone 12 moving east.

211
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,184
It's metal.

212
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,394
Then it couldn't be one of those creatures.

213
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,067
Could be a speeder, one of ours.

214
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,189
No.

215
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,648
Wait.

216
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,400
There's something very weak coming through.

217
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,828
Sir, I'm fluent in six million
forms of communication.

218
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,660
This signal is not used by the Alliance.

219
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,166
It could be an imperial code.

220
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:46,874
It could be an imperial code.

221
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,082
It isn't friendly, whatever it is.

222
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,089
Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.

223
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:57,420
Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.

224
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,620
<i>I'm afraid there's not much left.</i>

225
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:34,622
What was it?

226
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,216
<i>Droid of some kind.</i>

227
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,501
<i>I didn't hit it that hard.
Must've had a self-destruct.</i>

228
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,012
An imperial probe droid.

229
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,139
<i>It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.</i>

230
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,223
We'd better start the evacuation.

231
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,389
Admiral.

232
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:32,898
Yes, Captain?

233
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,183
I think we've got something, sir.

234
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:38,521
The report is only a fragment from
a probe droid in the Hoth system...

235
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,363
but it's the best lead we've had.

236
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,491
We have thousands of probe
droids searching the galaxy.

237
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:44,697
I want proof, not leads.

238
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,488
The visuals indicate life readings.

239
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:47,700
It could mean anything.

240
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,539
If we followed up every lead--

241
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,204
But, sir, the Hoth system is
supposed to be devoid of humans.

242
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,492
You've found something?

243
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:54,707
Yes, my lord.

244
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,462
That's it. The rebels are there.

245
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:04,053
My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements.

246
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,046
It could be smugglers--

247
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,925
That is the system.

248
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,430
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

249
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:12,562
Set your course for the Hoth system.

250
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,847
General Veers, prepare your men.

251
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,358
Admiral.

252
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,401
Groups 7 and 10 will stay
behind to fly the speeders.

253
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,195
As soon as each transport is loaded...

254
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,286
evacuation control will give
clearance for immediate launch.

255
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,363
Right, sir.

256
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,577
All right! That's it.

257
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:36,708
Try it.

258
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,626
Oh! Turn it off! Turn it off!

259
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,918
Turn it off!

260
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:47,672
Sir, it will take quite a
while to evacuate the T-47s.

261
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:48,673
Forget the heavy equipment.

262
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,137
There's plenty of time...

263
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,679
to get the smaller modules on the transports.

264
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,677
Take care, sir.

265
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:53,761
Thanks.

266
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,936
Chewie, take care of yourself, O.K.?

267
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,405
O.K., O.K.!

268
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,404
Hi, kid.

269
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,568
There's got to be a reason for it.

270
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,033
Check it at the other end.

271
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,327
Wait a second.

272
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,828
You all right?

273
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,240
Yeah.

274
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,964
Be careful.

275
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,803
You, too.

276
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,686
General, there's a fleet of Stardestroyers...

277
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:37,683
coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.

278
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:40,686
Reroute all power to the energy shield.

279
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,689
We gotta hold them till all transports are away.

280
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,280
Prepare for ground assault.

281
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,211
What is it, General?

282
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:02,881
My lord, the fleet has moved out of light speed.

283
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,166
ComScan has detected an energy field...

284
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,674
protecting an area of the sixth
planet of the Hoth system.

285
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,377
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

286
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:13,184
The rebels are alerted to our presence.

287
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,180
Admiral Ozzel came out of light
speed too close to the system.

288
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,186
He-- He felt surprise was wiser.

289
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,770
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

290
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,186
General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.

291
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,779
Yes, my lord.

292
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,572
Lord Vader.

293
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,698
The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to--

294
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:42,208
You have failed me for the last time, Admiral.

295
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,501
Captain Piett.

296
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,209
Yes, my lord?

297
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:48,296
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

298
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:51,382
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

299
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:54,718
You are in command now, Admiral Piett.

300
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,226
Thank you, Lord Vader.

301
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:01,147
All troop carriers will
assemble at the north entrance.

302
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:04,026
The heavy transport ships will
leave as soon as they're loaded.

303
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:06,275
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

304
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:09,109
The energy shield can only
be opened for a short time...

305
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,648
so you'll have to stay very
close to your transports.

306
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:14,157
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?

307
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,659
The ion cannon will fire several shots...

308
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,791
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

309
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:21,957
When you've gotten past the energy shield...

310
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,163
proceed directly to the rendezvous point.

311
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,672
Understood?

312
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,174
Good luck.

313
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,174
O.K. Everybody to your stations.

314
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:30,465
Let's go.

315
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,981
Their primary target will be the power generators.

316
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:52,658
Prepare to open shield.

317
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,704
Sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector.

318
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,873
Good. Our first catch of the day.

319
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,538
Stand by, ion control.

320
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:09,040
Fire.

321
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:27,353
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

322
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,901
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

323
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:38,571
Feeling all right, sir?

324
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,413
Just like new, Dak. How about you?

325
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,576
Right now I feel I could take
on the whole Empire myself.

326
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,833
I know what you mean.

327
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,303
Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

328
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,148
We've spotted imperial walkers.

329
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:09,517
<i>Imperial walkers on the north ridge.</i>

330
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,464
Echo Station Five-Seven. We're on our way.

331
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:41,884
All right, boys, keep tight now.

332
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,141
Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set.

333
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,729
Steady, Dak.

334
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,682
Attack pattern Delta. Go now.

335
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,111
All right. I'm coming in.

336
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,782
Hobbie, you still with me?

337
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,556
That armor's too strong for blasters.

338
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,179
Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables.

339
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:32,063
Go for the legs. It might be our
only chance of stopping them.

340
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:34,103
All right. Stand by, Dak.

341
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:37,024
Oh, Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control.

342
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:39,149
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

343
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:41,822
Just hang on. Hang on, Dak.

344
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:44,076
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

345
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,451
Dak?

346
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:51,583
Dak!

347
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:17,528
Yes, Lord Vader, I've reached
the main power generators.

348
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,114
The shield will be down in moments.

349
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,910
You may start your landing.

350
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,913
Rogue Three.

351
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,202
Copy, Rogue Leader.

352
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,160
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.

353
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:31,538
You'll have to make this shot.

354
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,377
I'll cover for you.

355
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:36,956
Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass.

356
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,001
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

357
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,213
Steady, Rogue Two.

358
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:45,380
Activate harpoon.

359
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,889
Good shot, Janson.

360
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:58,233
One more pass.
- Coming around, Wedge.

361
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,068
Cable out. Let her go!

362
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:08,031
Detach cable.

363
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,279
Cable detached.

364
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,798
Come on.

365
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,307
Hah! That got him!

366
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,225
I see it, Wedge. Good work.

367
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,762
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

368
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:34,138
It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer.

369
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,646
We have no choice.

370
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:37,690
Launch patrol.

371
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,610
Evacuate remaining ground staff.

372
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,772
No, no! No.

373
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,782
This one goes there.

374
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,033
That one goes there, right?

375
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:52,030
R2, you take good care of
Master Luke now, understand?

376
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:55,576
And do take good care of yourself.

377
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,793
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

378
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,774
All troops will debark for ground assault.

379
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,531
Prepare to target the main generator.

380
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,081
Rogue Two, are you all right?

381
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,668
Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

382
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:38,621
Well, set harpoon. I'll cover for you.

383
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,543
Coming around.

384
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:44,462
Watch that crossfire, boys.

385
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,385
Set for position three.

386
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:47,793
Steady.

387
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,176
Stay tight and low.

388
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:50,422
This is it!

389
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,558
Hobbie!

390
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,149
I've been hit!

391
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:42,687
You all right?

392
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,728
Why are you still here?

393
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,690
Heard the command center had been hit.

394
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:47,688
You've got your clearance to leave.

395
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,651
Don't worry. I'll leave.

396
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:51,444
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

397
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,202
Your Highness, we must take this last transport.

398
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,243
It's our only hope.

399
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:55,570
Send all troops in Sector 12...

400
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:57,664
to the south slope to protect the fighters.

401
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:01,245
<i>Imperial troops have entered the base.</i>

402
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:02,755
<i>Imperial troops have entered-- </i>

403
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:04,375
Come on. That's it.

404
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:07,045
Give the evacuation code signal.

405
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,793
And get to your transports!

406
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,804
Oh! Wait for me!

407
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:15,340
Begin retreat!

408
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:17,019
Fall back!

409
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,905
Distance to power generators?

410
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,319
<i>17.28.</i>

411
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:29,375
Target. Maximum firepower.

412
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,116
Transport, this is Solo.

413
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:58,360
Better take off. I can't get to you.

414
00:33:58,496 --> 00:33:59,362
<i>I'll get her out on the Falcon.</i>

415
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:00,363
Come on.

416
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,873
But where are you going?

417
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:05,033
Come back!

418
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,895
Wait!

419
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:25,813
Wait for me! Wait! Stop!

420
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,399
How typical.

421
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,901
Come on.

422
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:30,770
Gahhh!

423
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,728
Hurry up, goldenrod.

424
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:36,107
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

425
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:37,618
Wait! Wait!

426
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:56,751
How's this?

427
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:58,715
Would it help if I got out and pushed?

428
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:00,046
Captain Solo! Captain Solo!

429
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:01,048
It might.

430
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:05,021
Sir, might I suggest that you--

431
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,806
It can wait.

432
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:13,275
This bucket of bolts is never
gonna get us past that blockade.

433
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:15,730
This baby's got a few surprises
left in her, sweetheart.

434
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:26,282
Come on! Come on!

435
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:28,956
Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

436
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,673
See?

437
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,125
Someday you're gonna be wrong,
and I just hope I'm there to see it.

438
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:38,919
Punch it!

439
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:58,025
R2!

440
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:01,740
Get her ready for take-off.

441
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:06,199
Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.

442
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:09,827
Don't worry, R2.

443
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:11,835
We're going. We're going.

444
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:25,678
There's nothing wrong, R2.

445
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,850
I'm just setting a new course.

446
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:33,138
We're not gonna regroup with the others.

447
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:35,482
We're going to the Dagobah system.

448
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,315
Yes, R2?

449
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:42,658
That's all right.

450
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:45,193
I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.

451
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:02,795
I saw 'em! I saw 'em!

452
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,306
Saw what?

453
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:06,591
Stardestroyers, two of 'em coming right at us.

454
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:07,805
Sir! Sir!

455
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:08,885
Might I suggest--

456
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,977
Shut him up or shut him down!

457
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:13,264
Check the deflector shield.

458
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,273
Great.

459
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:17,441
Well, we can still outmaneuver them.

460
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:23,657
Take evasive action!

461
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:37,040
Prepare to make the jump to light speed.

462
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:38,087
But, sir!

463
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:40,789
They're getting closer.

464
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:43,050
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

465
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:47,345
Watch what?

466
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:50,390
I think we're in trouble.

467
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,429
If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier...

468
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:54,141
the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.

469
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:56,017
It's impossible to go to light speed.

470
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:58,689
We're in trouble.

471
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:03,193
Horizontal boosters!

472
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:07,408
Alluvial dampers.

473
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:09,162
Ow!

474
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,198
That's not it.

475
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:12,875
Bring me the hydrospanner!

476
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:18,247
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this one.

477
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:21,790
Ow!

478
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:23,006
Chewie!

479
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:28,718
That wasn't a laser blast. Something hit us.

480
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,261
Han, get up here!

481
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,430
Come on, Chewie!

482
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:35,271
Asteroids.

483
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:38,814
Oh, no.

484
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:40,319
Chewie, set two-seven-one.

485
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:41,820
What are you doing?

486
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:45,529
You're not actually going into an asteroid field?

487
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:48,494
They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?

488
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:52,531
You don't have to do this to impress me.

489
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:55,203
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field...

490
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:57,411
is approximately 3,720 to 1.

491
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,205
Never tell me the odds!

492
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:23,152
Look out!

493
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:29,151
You said you wanted to be
around when I made a mistake.

494
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:30,910
This could be it, sweetheart.

495
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:32,068
I take it back.

496
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:33,747
We're going to get pulverized...

497
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,071
if we stay out here much longer.

498
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,488
Ain't gonna argue with that.

499
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:39,164
I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.

500
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:40,125
Closer?!

501
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:41,120
Closer?!

502
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:10,115
Oh, this is suicide! There's nowhere to go.

503
00:40:10,243 --> 00:40:12,200
There. That looks pretty good.

504
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:14,451
What looks pretty good?

505
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:16,454
Yeah, that'll do nicely.

506
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,667
Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?

507
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:32,175
I hope you know what you're doing.

508
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:33,386
Yeah. Me, too.

509
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:44,439
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

510
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:49,111
No, I'm not gonna change my mind about this.

511
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,526
I'm not picking up any cities or technology.

512
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,198
Massive life form readings, though.

513
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,821
There's something alive down there.

514
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:02,371
Yes. I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.

515
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:10,712
I know! I know!

516
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:14,510
All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing.

517
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:15,672
Just hang on.

518
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:17,766
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

519
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:12,694
No, R2, you stay put.

520
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:14,532
I'll have a look around.

521
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,245
R2?

522
00:42:21,374 --> 00:42:22,288
R2!

523
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:25,331
Where are you?

524
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,299
R2!

525
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:38,724
You be more careful.

526
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,557
R2, that way.

527
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:13,962
R2!

528
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,227
<i>Beeep!</i>

529
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:43,033
Oh, no.

530
00:43:43,164 --> 00:43:45,038
Are you all right?

531
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:46,542
Come on.

532
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:52,002
You were lucky to get out of there.

533
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:54,124
Anything broken?

534
00:43:57,804 --> 00:44:00,473
If you're saying coming here was a bad idea...

535
00:44:00,598 --> 00:44:02,009
I'm beginning to agree with you.

536
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:05,803
R2, what are we doing here?

537
00:44:05,937 --> 00:44:11,442
It's like... something out of a dream or...

538
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:13,145
I don't know.

539
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:15,603
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

540
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:48,847
Yes, Admiral?

541
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,767
<i>Our ships have sighted the
Millennium Falcon, lord...</i>

542
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,984
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk--

543
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:57,187
Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.

544
00:44:57,322 --> 00:45:00,489
I want that ship, not excuses.

545
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:02,656
Yes, lord.

546
00:45:06,664 --> 00:45:08,622
I'm gonna shut down everything...

547
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,707
but the emergency power systems.

548
00:45:10,835 --> 00:45:14,703
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,
but does that include shutting me down, too?

549
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:17,128
<i>No. I need you to talk to the Falcon.</i>

550
00:45:17,258 --> 00:45:20,295
Find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.

551
00:45:27,018 --> 00:45:30,387
Sir, it's quite possible this
asteroid is not entirely stable.

552
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:32,847
Not entirely stable?

553
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:34,607
I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.

554
00:45:34,734 --> 00:45:36,442
Chewie, take the professor in the back...

555
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:38,147
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

556
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:41,150
Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior.

557
00:45:41,282 --> 00:45:43,655
After all, I'm only trying to do my job.

558
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:49,826
Let go.
- Shh!

559
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:52,908
Let go, please.

560
00:45:53,044 --> 00:45:54,373
Don't get excited.

561
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:55,879
Captain, being held by you...

562
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:58,212
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

563
00:45:58,341 --> 00:45:59,717
Sorry, sweetheart.

564
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:02,630
I haven't got time for anything else.

565
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:39,040
Ready for some power?

566
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:40,834
OK.

567
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:45,554
Let's see now.

568
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,472
Put that in there.

569
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,678
There you go.

570
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:54,396
Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda...

571
00:46:54,522 --> 00:46:55,981
if he even exists.

572
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:06,277
It's really a strange place to find a Jedi master.

573
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:08,698
This place gives me the creeps.

574
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:15,368
Still...

575
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:17,328
there's something familiar about this place.

576
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:20,964
I don't know.

577
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:22,170
I feel like--

578
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,507
Feel like what?

579
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:26,260
Like we're being watched!

580
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:28,131
Away put your weapon!

581
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:30,257
I mean you no harm.

582
00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:33,309
I am wondering... why are you here?

583
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:36,390
I'm looking for someone.

584
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:37,851
Looking?

585
00:47:37,982 --> 00:47:40,770
Found someone you have, I would say, hmmm?

586
00:47:40,902 --> 00:47:43,523
Right.

587
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:46,858
Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.

588
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:48,949
I don't think so.

589
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:51,912
I'm looking for a great warrior.

590
00:47:53,415 --> 00:47:55,206
A great warrior.

591
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:57,705
Ha ha ha!

592
00:47:57,836 --> 00:48:00,161
Wars not make one great.

593
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:09,881
Put that down.

594
00:48:10,015 --> 00:48:12,506
Hey! That's my dinner!

595
00:48:15,228 --> 00:48:18,514
How you get so big eating food of this kind?

596
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:21,186
Listen, friend, we didn't
mean to land in that puddle.

597
00:48:21,317 --> 00:48:22,480
And if we could get our ship out, we would.

598
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:23,725
But we can't, so why don't you--

599
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:25,653
Cannot get your ship out. Hee hee hee!

600
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,061
Hey, get out of there!

601
00:48:28,658 --> 00:48:30,651
No! Ooh!

602
00:48:30,785 --> 00:48:33,111
Hey, you could have broken this.

603
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:35,369
Don't do that.

604
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:48,345
You're making a mess.

605
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:51,471
Hey, give me that!

606
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:54,136
Mine, or I will help you not.

607
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:56,011
I don't want your help. I want my lamp back.

608
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:58,137
I'm gonna need it to get out of this slimy mud-hole.

609
00:48:58,271 --> 00:48:59,646
Mud-hole? Slimy?

610
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:02,394
My home this is--

611
00:49:02,525 --> 00:49:04,933
Wha-- Mmm!

612
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:06,694
R2, let him have it.

613
00:49:08,656 --> 00:49:10,982
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

614
00:49:11,117 --> 00:49:12,196
R2!

615
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:16,868
Now, will you move along, little fellow?

616
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:18,623
We've got a lot of work to do.

617
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,161
No! No, no!

618
00:49:20,293 --> 00:49:23,709
Stay and help you I will... find your friend.

619
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:26,080
I'm not looking for a friend.

620
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:27,461
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

621
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:31,804
Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.

622
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,424
You seek Yoda.

623
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:34,671
You know him?

624
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:38,141
Mmmm. Take you to him I will.

625
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:42,896
Yes, yes, but now we must eat. Come.

626
00:49:43,024 --> 00:49:44,602
Good food.

627
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:46,063
Come.

628
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:57,072
Come, come.

629
00:49:58,498 --> 00:50:03,243
R2... stay and watch after the camp.

630
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:19,019
Oh! Where is R2 when I need him?

631
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:22,180
Sir, I don't know where your
ship learned to communicate...

632
00:50:22,313 --> 00:50:23,973
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

633
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:26,064
I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling...

634
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:27,603
on the negative axis has been polarized.

635
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:30,191
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

636
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:33,525
Well, of course I'll have to replace it.

637
00:50:33,658 --> 00:50:35,117
Here!

638
00:50:35,243 --> 00:50:36,986
And, Chewie...

639
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,321
I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling.

640
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:06,346
Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.

641
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:08,771
Would you please stop calling me that?

642
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:10,978
Sure, Leia.

643
00:51:11,112 --> 00:51:13,105
You make it so difficult sometimes.

644
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:15,149
I do. I really do.

645
00:51:15,283 --> 00:51:18,154
You could be a little nicer, though.

646
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:21,157
Come on, admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

647
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:25,121
Occasionally... maybe...

648
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:27,789
when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.

649
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:29,664
Scoundrel?

650
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:31,292
Scoundrel?

651
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:36,126
I like the sound of that.

652
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:37,128
Stop that.

653
00:51:37,263 --> 00:51:38,923
Stop what?

654
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:41,096
Stop that. My hands are dirty.

655
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:43,633
My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?

656
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,885
Afraid?

657
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:46,895
You're trembling.

658
00:51:47,023 --> 00:51:48,648
I'm not trembling.

659
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:52,938
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

660
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:55,064
There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.

661
00:51:55,198 --> 00:51:57,654
I happen to like nice men.

662
00:51:57,784 --> 00:51:58,733
I'm a nice man.

663
00:51:58,868 --> 00:52:00,528
No, you're not. You're--

664
00:52:02,914 --> 00:52:04,289
Sir, sir!

665
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:07,037
I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.

666
00:52:09,295 --> 00:52:10,494
Thank you.

667
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:11,959
Thank you very much.

668
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:13,833
Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

669
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:23,134
And that was the last time they
appeared in any of our scopes.

670
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:24,762
Considering the amount of damage we've sustained...

671
00:52:24,894 --> 00:52:26,092
they must have been destroyed.

672
00:52:26,229 --> 00:52:28,850
No, Captain. They're alive.

673
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,891
I want every ship available...

674
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:32,568
to sweep the asteroid field...

675
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:33,974
until they are found.

676
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,271
Lord Vader.

677
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:41,283
Yes, Admiral. What is it?

678
00:52:41,411 --> 00:52:42,786
The emperor commands you...

679
00:52:42,912 --> 00:52:44,288
to make contact with him.

680
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:46,371
Move the ship out of the asteroid field...

681
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:49,204
so that we can send a clear transmission.

682
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:50,794
Yes, my lord.

683
00:53:07,228 --> 00:53:09,766
What is thy bidding, my master?

684
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:13,520
There is a great disturbance...

685
00:53:13,651 --> 00:53:15,893
in the Force.

686
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:18,354
I have felt it.

687
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,981
We have a new enemy...

688
00:53:21,117 --> 00:53:25,115
the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star.

689
00:53:25,246 --> 00:53:28,532
I have no doubt this boy...

690
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:32,878
is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.

691
00:53:33,004 --> 00:53:35,211
How is that possible?

692
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,839
Search your feelings, Lord Vader.

693
00:53:38,968 --> 00:53:42,088
You will know it to be true.

694
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:44,677
He could destroy us.

695
00:53:44,808 --> 00:53:46,931
He's just a boy.

696
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,468
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

697
00:53:49,604 --> 00:53:53,222
The Force is strong with him.

698
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:56,560
The son of Skywalker...

699
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:59,482
must not become a Jedi.

700
00:53:59,614 --> 00:54:01,773
If he could be turned...

701
00:54:01,908 --> 00:54:04,743
he would become a powerful ally.

702
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:07,407
Yes.

703
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:12,620
He would be a great asset.

704
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:15,077
Can it be done?

705
00:54:15,213 --> 00:54:19,163
He will join us or die, master.

706
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:37,109
Look, I'm sure it's delicious.

707
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:40,022
I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.

708
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:41,020
Patience!

709
00:54:41,156 --> 00:54:42,531
For the Jedi...

710
00:54:42,657 --> 00:54:44,449
it is time to eat as well.

711
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:46,449
Hmm? Heh heh.

712
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:49,698
Eat, eat.

713
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:50,862
Hot!

714
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,582
Good food! Mmm, good, hmm?

715
00:55:00,717 --> 00:55:03,753
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

716
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,595
Not far. Yoda not far.

717
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:08,889
Patience. Soon you will be with him.

718
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:12,930
Root leaf.

719
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:14,391
I cook.

720
00:55:14,522 --> 00:55:18,900
Why wish you become Jedi? Hmm? Hmm?

721
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:21,150
Mostly because of my father, I guess.

722
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:22,477
Ah, father.

723
00:55:22,614 --> 00:55:24,986
Powerful Jedi was he.

724
00:55:25,116 --> 00:55:26,990
Hee hee. Mmm, powerful Jedi.

725
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:28,778
Oh, come on.

726
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:30,323
How could you know my father?

727
00:55:30,455 --> 00:55:32,163
You don't even know who I am.

728
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,164
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

729
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:36,036
We're wasting our time!

730
00:55:37,128 --> 00:55:38,955
I cannot teach him.

731
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:41,461
The boy has no patience.

732
00:55:41,591 --> 00:55:44,164
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

733
00:55:44,302 --> 00:55:45,381
Hmm...

734
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:51,429
Much anger in him...

735
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:53,469
like his father.

736
00:55:53,603 --> 00:55:57,304
<i>Was I any different when you taught me?</i>

737
00:55:58,692 --> 00:56:00,483
No.

738
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,401
He is not ready.

739
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:03,809
Yoda.

740
00:56:06,032 --> 00:56:07,361
I am ready.

741
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:09,734
Ben-- I can be a Jedi.

742
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:11,827
Ben, tell him I'm--

743
00:56:11,955 --> 00:56:13,330
Ready, are you?

744
00:56:13,456 --> 00:56:15,698
What know you ready?

745
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:19,167
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

746
00:56:19,295 --> 00:56:21,786
My own counsel will I keep...

747
00:56:21,923 --> 00:56:24,758
on who is to be trained.

748
00:56:24,884 --> 00:56:29,463
A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, hmm?

749
00:56:29,597 --> 00:56:31,471
The most serious mind.

750
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:37,271
This one a long time have I watched.

751
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:40,398
All his life has he looked away...

752
00:56:40,525 --> 00:56:43,561
to the future, to the horizon.

753
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:47,230
Never his mind on where he was...

754
00:56:47,365 --> 00:56:48,396
hmm?

755
00:56:48,533 --> 00:56:50,442
What he was doing.

756
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:52,119
Hmph!

757
00:56:52,245 --> 00:56:53,324
Adventure.

758
00:56:53,455 --> 00:56:54,450
Ha!

759
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:55,956
Excitement. Ha!

760
00:56:56,082 --> 00:56:58,704
A Jedi craves not these things.

761
00:56:58,835 --> 00:57:01,456
You are reckless!

762
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:04,542
<i>So was I, if you remember.</i>

763
00:57:04,674 --> 00:57:07,509
He is too old.

764
00:57:07,635 --> 00:57:10,305
Yes, too old to begin the training.

765
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,921
But I've learned so much.

766
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:17,806
Ahh...

767
00:57:19,397 --> 00:57:22,268
Will he finish what he begins?

768
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,025
I won't fail you.

769
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,230
I'm not afraid.

770
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:29,980
Oh...

771
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:33,485
You will be.

772
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:36,989
You will be.

773
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:20,956
Sir, if I may venture an opinion--

774
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:22,993
I'm not really interested in your opinion.

775
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:24,408
There's something out there.

776
00:58:24,629 --> 00:58:25,708
Where?

777
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:26,788
Outside in the cave.

778
00:58:28,508 --> 00:58:29,836
There it is. Listen. Listen!

779
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:30,964
I'm going out there.

780
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:32,173
Are you crazy?

781
00:58:32,303 --> 00:58:33,548
I just got this bucket back together.

782
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,672
I'm not going to let something tear it apart.

783
00:58:35,807 --> 00:58:37,467
Then I'm going with you.

784
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,178
I think it might be better...

785
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,350
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

786
00:58:41,479 --> 00:58:42,393
Oh, no.

787
00:58:56,369 --> 00:58:59,572
This ground sure feels strange.

788
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:02,161
It doesn't feel like rock.

789
00:59:05,628 --> 00:59:09,080
There's an awful lot of moisture in here.

790
00:59:09,215 --> 00:59:11,007
I don't know.

791
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:14,135
I have a bad feeling about this.

792
00:59:14,262 --> 00:59:15,341
Yeah.

793
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:17,970
Watch out!

794
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:20,429
It's all right.

795
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,639
It's all right.

796
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:23,561
Yeah, that's what I thought-- mynock.

797
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:25,432
Chewie, check the rest of the ship...

798
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:27,890
and make sure there are no more attached...

799
00:59:28,026 --> 00:59:29,900
chewing on the power cables.

800
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:31,605
Mynocks.

801
00:59:32,064 --> 00:59:34,271
Go on inside. We'll clean them
off if there are any more.

802
00:59:38,821 --> 00:59:40,564
Han!

803
00:59:42,158 --> 00:59:44,779
Go away, go away, beastly thing!

804
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:45,906
Shoo! Shoo!

805
00:59:52,793 --> 00:59:54,667
Wait a minute...

806
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:17,901
Let's get out of here!

807
01:00:18,027 --> 01:00:20,066
The Empire is still out there! I don't think--

808
01:00:20,196 --> 01:00:22,354
No time to discuss this in committee!

809
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,447
I'm not a committee!

810
01:00:30,456 --> 01:00:33,327
You can't make the jump to light
speed in this asteroid field.

811
01:00:33,459 --> 01:00:36,128
Sit down, sweetheart! We're taking off!

812
01:00:39,966 --> 01:00:40,879
Look!

813
01:00:41,008 --> 01:00:42,289
I see it. I see it.

814
01:00:42,426 --> 01:00:43,340
We're doomed!

815
01:00:43,469 --> 01:00:44,797
The cave is collapsing.

816
01:00:44,929 --> 01:00:46,803
This is no cave.
- What?

817
01:01:19,422 --> 01:01:20,667
Run!

818
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:24,582
Yes! A Jedi's strength flows from the Force.

819
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:27,340
But beware of the dark side.

820
01:01:27,471 --> 01:01:29,096
Anger, fear, aggression--

821
01:01:29,223 --> 01:01:32,307
The dark side of the Force are they...

822
01:01:32,435 --> 01:01:35,352
easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight.

823
01:01:35,479 --> 01:01:38,184
If once you start down the dark path...

824
01:01:38,316 --> 01:01:40,355
forever will it dominate your destiny.

825
01:01:40,484 --> 01:01:41,860
Consume you it will...

826
01:01:41,986 --> 01:01:43,729
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

827
01:01:43,863 --> 01:01:45,238
Vader.

828
01:01:45,364 --> 01:01:47,571
Is the dark side stronger?

829
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,075
No, no.

830
01:01:49,201 --> 01:01:50,530
No.

831
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:53,069
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

832
01:01:53,205 --> 01:01:56,041
How do I know the good side from the bad?

833
01:01:56,167 --> 01:01:59,370
You will know when you are calm...

834
01:01:59,503 --> 01:02:01,377
at peace...

835
01:02:01,505 --> 01:02:03,083
passive.

836
01:02:03,215 --> 01:02:06,419
A Jedi uses the Force...

837
01:02:06,552 --> 01:02:08,212
for knowledge and defense...

838
01:02:08,346 --> 01:02:10,504
never for attack.

839
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,588
But tell me why I can't--

840
01:02:11,724 --> 01:02:13,763
No, no. There is no why.

841
01:02:13,893 --> 01:02:16,598
Nothing more will I teach you today.

842
01:02:16,729 --> 01:02:19,220
Clear your mind of questions.

843
01:02:19,357 --> 01:02:23,057
Hmm...

844
01:02:23,194 --> 01:02:24,771
Mmm...

845
01:02:41,587 --> 01:02:43,710
There's something not right here.

846
01:02:47,426 --> 01:02:49,585
I feel cold...

847
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,799
death.

848
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:53,006
That place...

849
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,260
is strong with the dark side of the Force.

850
01:02:56,394 --> 01:02:58,682
A domain of evil it is.

851
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:02,065
In you must go.

852
01:03:02,191 --> 01:03:04,480
What's in there?

853
01:03:06,487 --> 01:03:08,480
Only what you take with you.

854
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,535
Your weapons...

855
01:03:14,662 --> 01:03:16,868
you will not need them.

856
01:05:45,354 --> 01:05:46,350
Hmph...

857
01:05:56,449 --> 01:05:57,314
Bounty hunters.

858
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:58,825
We don't need their scum.

859
01:05:58,951 --> 01:06:00,326
Yes, sir.

860
01:06:00,453 --> 01:06:02,445
Those rebels won't escape us.

861
01:06:08,169 --> 01:06:10,541
Sir, we have a priority signal...

862
01:06:10,671 --> 01:06:12,463
<i>from the Stardestroyer Avenger.</i>

863
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:15,544
There will be a substantial reward...

864
01:06:15,676 --> 01:06:17,550
for the one who finds...

865
01:06:17,678 --> 01:06:19,552
<i>the Millennium Falcon.</i>

866
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,218
You are free to use any methods necessary...

867
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:24,473
but I want them alive.

868
01:06:24,602 --> 01:06:27,009
No disintegrations.

869
01:06:27,146 --> 01:06:28,973
As you wish.

870
01:06:29,106 --> 01:06:30,304
Lord Vader.

871
01:06:30,441 --> 01:06:33,062
My lord, we have them.

872
01:06:37,657 --> 01:06:39,364
Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of...

873
01:06:39,492 --> 01:06:40,737
the asteroid field.

874
01:06:44,455 --> 01:06:46,282
Let's get out of here.

875
01:06:46,415 --> 01:06:47,826
Ready for light speed?

876
01:06:47,959 --> 01:06:49,157
1...

877
01:06:49,293 --> 01:06:50,918
2...

878
01:06:51,045 --> 01:06:52,160
3!

879
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:59,541
It's not fair.

880
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,338
Transfer circuits aren't working.

881
01:07:03,474 --> 01:07:05,431
It's not my fault!

882
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:06,508
No light speed?

883
01:07:06,644 --> 01:07:08,471
It's not my fault.

884
01:07:13,275 --> 01:07:15,268
Sir, we've just lost the main rear deflector shield.

885
01:07:15,403 --> 01:07:17,644
One more direct hit on the back
quarter and we're done for.

886
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,488
Turn her around.

887
01:07:19,615 --> 01:07:21,442
I'm going to put all power in the front shield.

888
01:07:21,575 --> 01:07:23,200
You're going to attack them?

889
01:07:23,327 --> 01:07:26,412
Sir, the odds of surviving a
direct assault on an imperial--

890
01:07:26,539 --> 01:07:28,448
Shut up!

891
01:07:34,964 --> 01:07:36,921
They're moving to attack position.

892
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,214
Shields up.

893
01:07:44,974 --> 01:07:46,302
Track them.

894
01:07:46,434 --> 01:07:48,473
They may come around for another pass.

895
01:07:48,602 --> 01:07:51,010
Captain Needa, the ship no
longer appears on our scopes.

896
01:07:51,147 --> 01:07:52,974
They can't have disappeared.

897
01:07:53,107 --> 01:07:55,645
No ship that small has a cloaking device.

898
01:07:55,776 --> 01:07:57,568
Well, there's no trace of them, sir.

899
01:07:57,695 --> 01:07:59,604
Captain, Lord Vader demands
an update on the pursuit.

900
01:08:02,158 --> 01:08:03,818
Get a shuttle ready.

901
01:08:03,951 --> 01:08:06,525
I shall assume full
responsibility for losing them...

902
01:08:06,662 --> 01:08:08,240
and apologize to Lord Vader.

903
01:08:08,372 --> 01:08:10,246
Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.

904
01:08:10,374 --> 01:08:11,916
Yes, Captain Needa.

905
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:18,956
Use the Force.

906
01:08:19,091 --> 01:08:20,005
Yes.

907
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,300
Now, the stone...

908
01:08:30,895 --> 01:08:32,887
Feel it.

909
01:08:44,909 --> 01:08:46,700
Concentrate!

910
01:09:00,925 --> 01:09:04,424
Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.

911
01:09:04,553 --> 01:09:06,261
So certain are you.

912
01:09:09,934 --> 01:09:13,018
Always with you it cannot be done.

913
01:09:14,814 --> 01:09:16,771
Hear you nothing that I say?

914
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:19,307
Master, moving stones around is one thing.

915
01:09:19,443 --> 01:09:20,938
This is totally different.

916
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:22,648
No! No different!

917
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:25,105
Only different in your mind.

918
01:09:25,241 --> 01:09:28,859
You must unlearn what you have learned.

919
01:09:28,995 --> 01:09:31,486
All right. I'll give it a try.

920
01:09:31,622 --> 01:09:33,330
No! Try not.

921
01:09:33,457 --> 01:09:35,664
Do.

922
01:09:35,793 --> 01:09:37,038
Or do not.

923
01:09:37,169 --> 01:09:39,127
There is no try.

924
01:10:26,677 --> 01:10:29,512
I can't. It's too big.

925
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:32,509
Size matters not. Look at me.

926
01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:35,975
Judge me by my size, do you?

927
01:10:36,103 --> 01:10:37,052
Hmm?

928
01:10:37,188 --> 01:10:38,599
Hmph!

929
01:10:38,731 --> 01:10:40,889
And well you should not...

930
01:10:41,025 --> 01:10:44,145
for my ally is the Force.

931
01:10:44,278 --> 01:10:47,196
And a powerful ally it is.

932
01:10:47,323 --> 01:10:49,481
Life creates it...

933
01:10:49,617 --> 01:10:51,194
makes it grow.

934
01:10:52,495 --> 01:10:56,195
Its energy surrounds us...

935
01:10:56,332 --> 01:10:58,206
and binds us.

936
01:10:58,334 --> 01:11:00,457
Luminous beings are we...

937
01:11:00,586 --> 01:11:02,460
not this crude matter.

938
01:11:02,588 --> 01:11:06,668
You must feel the Force around you--

939
01:11:06,801 --> 01:11:10,134
Here, between you, me...

940
01:11:10,262 --> 01:11:11,377
the tree...

941
01:11:11,514 --> 01:11:13,257
the rock...

942
01:11:13,391 --> 01:11:14,386
everywhere!

943
01:11:14,517 --> 01:11:15,466
Yes...

944
01:11:17,103 --> 01:11:20,935
even between the land and the ship.

945
01:11:25,027 --> 01:11:26,984
You want the impossible.

946
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:03,414
Mm...

947
01:13:14,553 --> 01:13:15,419
I don't...

948
01:13:15,554 --> 01:13:17,677
I don't believe it.

949
01:13:18,849 --> 01:13:21,685
That is why you fail.

950
01:13:40,746 --> 01:13:44,826
Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

951
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:56,085
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan of the area and found nothing.

952
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:57,845
<i>If the Millennium Falcon went into light speed...</i>

953
01:13:57,972 --> 01:14:00,545
it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.

954
01:14:00,683 --> 01:14:02,307
Alert all commands.

955
01:14:02,435 --> 01:14:04,641
Calculate every possible destination...

956
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:06,893
along their last known trajectory.

957
01:14:07,023 --> 01:14:08,303
Yes, my lord. We'll find them.

958
01:14:08,441 --> 01:14:10,398
Don't fail me again...

959
01:14:11,485 --> 01:14:12,565
Admiral.

960
01:14:14,113 --> 01:14:15,987
Alert all commands.

961
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:17,989
Deploy the fleet.

962
01:14:33,007 --> 01:14:35,249
Captain Solo, this time you've gone too far.

963
01:14:37,011 --> 01:14:39,383
I will not be quiet.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

964
01:14:39,513 --> 01:14:41,423
The fleet's beginning to break up.

965
01:14:41,557 --> 01:14:43,514
Go back and stand by the manual release...

966
01:14:43,643 --> 01:14:45,600
for the landing claw.

967
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,937
I really don't see how that's going to help.

968
01:14:50,066 --> 01:14:53,269
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

969
01:14:53,402 --> 01:14:55,276
The Empire may be gracious enough--

970
01:14:55,404 --> 01:14:56,270
Thank you.

971
01:14:56,405 --> 01:14:58,065
What's your next move?

972
01:14:58,199 --> 01:14:59,574
If they follow standard imperial procedure...

973
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,076
they'll dump their garbage...

974
01:15:01,202 --> 01:15:02,613
before they go to light speed...

975
01:15:02,745 --> 01:15:04,120
and then we just float away.

976
01:15:04,246 --> 01:15:05,789
With the rest of the garbage.

977
01:15:05,956 --> 01:15:07,451
Then what?

978
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:10,074
Then we got to find a safe
port somewhere around here.

979
01:15:10,211 --> 01:15:11,076
Any ideas?

980
01:15:11,212 --> 01:15:12,623
Where are we?

981
01:15:12,755 --> 01:15:14,130
The Anoat system.

982
01:15:14,256 --> 01:15:16,130
There's not much there.

983
01:15:16,258 --> 01:15:20,090
No. Well, wait. This is interesting.

984
01:15:20,221 --> 01:15:21,300
Lando.

985
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:22,972
Lando system?

986
01:15:23,099 --> 01:15:25,803
Lando's not a system. He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

987
01:15:25,935 --> 01:15:28,307
He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel.

988
01:15:28,437 --> 01:15:29,682
You'd like him.

989
01:15:29,814 --> 01:15:31,972
Thanks.

990
01:15:32,108 --> 01:15:34,943
Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.

991
01:15:35,069 --> 01:15:36,978
A mining colony?

992
01:15:37,113 --> 01:15:39,485
Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

993
01:15:39,615 --> 01:15:42,486
Lando conned somebody out of it.

994
01:15:42,618 --> 01:15:45,370
We go back a long way, Lando and me.

995
01:15:45,496 --> 01:15:47,405
Can you trust him?

996
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:50,743
No. But he's got no love for the Empire...

997
01:15:50,876 --> 01:15:52,252
I can tell you that.

998
01:15:52,378 --> 01:15:54,869
Here we go, Chewie. Stand by.

999
01:15:55,006 --> 01:15:56,001
Detach.

1000
01:16:02,722 --> 01:16:04,761
You do have your moments.

1001
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:06,717
Not many of them...

1002
01:16:06,851 --> 01:16:09,223
but you do have them.

1003
01:16:42,261 --> 01:16:44,752
Concentrate.

1004
01:16:44,889 --> 01:16:47,973
Feel the Force flow.

1005
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,259
Yes.

1006
01:16:57,234 --> 01:16:58,777
Good.

1007
01:16:58,903 --> 01:17:00,278
Calm.

1008
01:17:00,404 --> 01:17:02,563
Yes.

1009
01:17:02,698 --> 01:17:05,984
Through the Force, things you will see.

1010
01:17:06,118 --> 01:17:09,653
Other places. The future. The past.

1011
01:17:09,789 --> 01:17:12,196
Old friends long gone.

1012
01:17:14,585 --> 01:17:15,830
Han?

1013
01:17:15,962 --> 01:17:18,250
Leia!

1014
01:17:22,802 --> 01:17:24,177
Control, control.

1015
01:17:24,303 --> 01:17:26,130
You must learn control!

1016
01:17:28,224 --> 01:17:32,471
I saw... I saw a city in the clouds.

1017
01:17:34,146 --> 01:17:36,720
Friends you have there.

1018
01:17:36,857 --> 01:17:38,815
They were in pain.

1019
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:42,228
It is the future you see.

1020
01:17:42,363 --> 01:17:43,643
Future?

1021
01:17:52,206 --> 01:17:54,080
Will they die?

1022
01:17:57,003 --> 01:17:58,663
Difficult to see.

1023
01:17:58,796 --> 01:18:01,999
Always in motion is the future.

1024
01:18:03,134 --> 01:18:05,921
I've got to go to them.

1025
01:18:07,471 --> 01:18:10,342
Decide you must how to serve them best.

1026
01:18:10,474 --> 01:18:13,144
If you leave now, help them you could...

1027
01:18:13,269 --> 01:18:15,178
but you would destroy all...

1028
01:18:15,313 --> 01:18:18,598
for which they have fought and suffered.

1029
01:18:31,829 --> 01:18:35,198
No, I don't have a landing permit.

1030
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:39,200
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

1031
01:18:39,337 --> 01:18:41,460
Wait a minute! Let me explain!

1032
01:18:41,589 --> 01:18:42,964
<i>You will not deviate from your present course.</i>

1033
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:44,632
Rather touchy, aren't they?

1034
01:18:44,759 --> 01:18:46,383
I thought you knew this person.

1035
01:18:48,512 --> 01:18:50,304
That was a long time ago.

1036
01:18:50,431 --> 01:18:52,091
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

1037
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:04,317
<i>Permission granted to land on Platform 3-2-7.</i>

1038
01:19:04,445 --> 01:19:05,856
Thank you.

1039
01:19:05,988 --> 01:19:07,862
Nothing to worry about.

1040
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:09,615
We go way back, Lando and me.

1041
01:19:09,742 --> 01:19:11,402
Who's worried?

1042
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:01,663
Oh. No one to meet us.

1043
01:20:01,794 --> 01:20:03,668
I don't like this.

1044
01:20:03,796 --> 01:20:06,168
Well, what would you like?

1045
01:20:06,299 --> 01:20:08,671
<i>They did let us land.</i>

1046
01:20:08,801 --> 01:20:10,675
Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine.

1047
01:20:10,803 --> 01:20:12,178
Trust me.

1048
01:20:16,851 --> 01:20:19,139
See? My friend.

1049
01:20:23,441 --> 01:20:25,979
Keep your eyes open, huh?

1050
01:20:28,112 --> 01:20:29,523
Hey!

1051
01:20:29,655 --> 01:20:31,315
Why, you slimy...

1052
01:20:31,449 --> 01:20:34,782
double-crossing, no-good swindler.

1053
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:37,318
You've got a lot of guts coming here...

1054
01:20:37,455 --> 01:20:39,115
after what you pulled.

1055
01:20:47,006 --> 01:20:49,497
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1056
01:20:49,634 --> 01:20:53,085
How you doin', you old pirate? So good to see you!

1057
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:56,257
Well, he seems very friendly.

1058
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:57,304
Yes.

1059
01:20:57,433 --> 01:20:59,473
Very friendly.

1060
01:20:59,602 --> 01:21:00,930
What are you doing here?

1061
01:21:01,062 --> 01:21:03,350
Ah, repairs. I thought you could help me out.

1062
01:21:03,481 --> 01:21:05,473
What have you done to my ship?

1063
01:21:05,608 --> 01:21:06,473
Your ship?

1064
01:21:06,609 --> 01:21:07,640
Hey, remember...

1065
01:21:07,777 --> 01:21:09,769
you lost her to me fair and square.

1066
01:21:09,904 --> 01:21:12,027
And how you doin', Chewbacca?

1067
01:21:13,532 --> 01:21:15,075
You still hanging around with this loser?

1068
01:21:17,662 --> 01:21:19,987
Hello. What have we here?

1069
01:21:20,122 --> 01:21:21,367
Welcome, I'm Lando Calrissian.

1070
01:21:21,499 --> 01:21:24,250
I'm the administrator of this facility.

1071
01:21:24,377 --> 01:21:26,250
And who might you be?

1072
01:21:26,379 --> 01:21:27,458
Leia.

1073
01:21:27,588 --> 01:21:29,130
Welcome, Leia.

1074
01:21:32,301 --> 01:21:35,670
All right, all right, you old smoothie.

1075
01:21:35,805 --> 01:21:39,174
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

1076
01:21:39,308 --> 01:21:40,719
My facilities are at your--

1077
01:21:40,851 --> 01:21:42,180
Well, really!

1078
01:21:42,311 --> 01:21:44,103
<i>What's wrong with the Falcon?</i>

1079
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:45,428
Hyperdrive.

1080
01:21:45,564 --> 01:21:47,438
I'll get my people to work on her.

1081
01:21:47,566 --> 01:21:49,226
That ship saved my life quite a few times.

1082
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,230
She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

1083
01:21:52,363 --> 01:21:55,483
How's the gas mine? Still paying off for you?

1084
01:21:55,616 --> 01:21:57,027
Not as well as I'd like.

1085
01:21:57,159 --> 01:21:59,199
We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient.

1086
01:21:59,328 --> 01:22:00,704
I've had supply problems of every kind.

1087
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:02,205
I've had labor difficulties.

1088
01:22:02,331 --> 01:22:03,909
Ha ha ha!

1089
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:05,583
What's so funny?

1090
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:07,204
You. Listen to you.

1091
01:22:07,336 --> 01:22:09,376
You sound like a businessman...

1092
01:22:09,505 --> 01:22:10,833
a responsible leader.

1093
01:22:10,965 --> 01:22:13,123
Who'd have thought that, huh?

1094
01:22:13,259 --> 01:22:15,797
Seeing you brings back a few things.

1095
01:22:15,928 --> 01:22:16,959
Yeah.

1096
01:22:17,096 --> 01:22:18,887
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

1097
01:22:19,015 --> 01:22:20,924
It's the price you pay...

1098
01:22:21,058 --> 01:22:22,967
for being successful.

1099
01:22:25,271 --> 01:22:27,726
Ooh. Nice to see a familiar face.

1100
01:22:27,857 --> 01:22:29,232
<i>E chu ta!</i>

1101
01:22:29,358 --> 01:22:30,734
How rude!

1102
01:22:32,361 --> 01:22:34,235
That sounds like an R2 unit in there.

1103
01:22:34,363 --> 01:22:35,822
I wonder if-- Hello?

1104
01:22:37,575 --> 01:22:38,950
How interesting.

1105
01:22:39,076 --> 01:22:40,654
Who are you?

1106
01:22:40,786 --> 01:22:42,162
Oh, my! I-- I'm terribly sorry.

1107
01:22:42,288 --> 01:22:43,782
I didn't mean to intrude.

1108
01:22:43,914 --> 01:22:44,994
No, please don't get up.

1109
01:22:51,505 --> 01:22:52,916
Gahhh.

1110
01:23:03,476 --> 01:23:06,049
Luke, you must complete the training.

1111
01:23:06,187 --> 01:23:07,847
I can't keep the vision out of my head.

1112
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,937
They're my friends. I got to help them.

1113
01:23:10,066 --> 01:23:12,189
You must not go.

1114
01:23:12,318 --> 01:23:15,402
But Han and Leia will die if I don't.

1115
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:17,072
<i>You don't know that.</i>

1116
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:20,033
<i>Even Yoda cannot see their fate.</i>

1117
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:22,282
But I can help them.

1118
01:23:22,411 --> 01:23:23,870
I feel the Force.

1119
01:23:23,996 --> 01:23:25,407
<i>But you cannot control it.</i>

1120
01:23:25,539 --> 01:23:28,030
<i>This is a dangerous time for you...</i>

1121
01:23:28,167 --> 01:23:31,916
<i>when you will be tempted by the
dark side of the Force.</i>

1122
01:23:32,046 --> 01:23:35,249
Yes! Yes! To Obi-Wan you listen.

1123
01:23:35,383 --> 01:23:38,419
The cave. Remember your failure at the cave.

1124
01:23:38,552 --> 01:23:41,803
But I've learned so much since then.

1125
01:23:41,931 --> 01:23:45,264
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and to finish what I've begun.

1126
01:23:45,393 --> 01:23:46,673
You have my word.

1127
01:23:46,811 --> 01:23:48,186
<i>It is you and your abilities...</i>

1128
01:23:48,312 --> 01:23:49,972
<i>the emperor wants.</i>

1129
01:23:50,106 --> 01:23:53,522
<i>That is why your friends are made to suffer.</i>

1130
01:23:53,651 --> 01:23:55,525
That's why I have to go.

1131
01:23:55,653 --> 01:23:58,938
<i>Luke, I don't want to lose you to the emperor...</i>

1132
01:23:59,073 --> 01:24:01,030
<i>the way I lost Vader.</i>

1133
01:24:01,158 --> 01:24:02,653
You won't.

1134
01:24:02,785 --> 01:24:04,694
Stopped they must be.

1135
01:24:04,829 --> 01:24:07,117
On this all depends.

1136
01:24:07,248 --> 01:24:09,537
Only a fully trained Jedi knight...

1137
01:24:09,667 --> 01:24:11,458
with the Force as his ally...

1138
01:24:11,585 --> 01:24:14,159
will conquer Vader and his emperor.

1139
01:24:14,297 --> 01:24:16,373
If you end your training now...

1140
01:24:16,507 --> 01:24:20,801
if you choose the quick and
easy path, as Vader did...

1141
01:24:20,928 --> 01:24:23,550
you will become an agent of evil.

1142
01:24:23,681 --> 01:24:24,630
<i>Patience.</i>

1143
01:24:24,765 --> 01:24:26,924
And sacrifice Han and Leia?

1144
01:24:27,059 --> 01:24:31,104
If you honor what they fight for... yes.

1145
01:24:31,230 --> 01:24:32,855
<i>If you choose to face Vader...</i>

1146
01:24:32,982 --> 01:24:34,310
<i>you will do it alone.</i>

1147
01:24:34,442 --> 01:24:36,434
<i>I cannot interfere.</i>

1148
01:24:37,737 --> 01:24:39,729
I understand.

1149
01:24:44,368 --> 01:24:45,566
R2.

1150
01:24:47,204 --> 01:24:49,031
Fire up the converters.

1151
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:52,246
<i>Luke!</i>

1152
01:24:52,376 --> 01:24:55,377
<i>Don't give in to hate.</i>

1153
01:24:55,504 --> 01:24:58,256
<i>That leads to the dark side.</i>

1154
01:24:58,382 --> 01:24:59,793
Strong is Vader.

1155
01:24:59,925 --> 01:25:02,713
Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.

1156
01:25:02,845 --> 01:25:04,304
I will.

1157
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:06,138
And I'll return.

1158
01:25:06,265 --> 01:25:07,640
I promise.

1159
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,314
Told you, I did.

1160
01:25:16,442 --> 01:25:18,150
Reckless is he.

1161
01:25:18,277 --> 01:25:19,308
Now...

1162
01:25:19,445 --> 01:25:21,153
matters are worse.

1163
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,151
<i>That boy is our last hope.</i>

1164
01:25:24,283 --> 01:25:26,323
No, there is another.

1165
01:25:58,150 --> 01:25:59,609
The ship's almost finished.

1166
01:25:59,735 --> 01:26:01,811
Two or three more things and we're in great shape.

1167
01:26:01,946 --> 01:26:03,523
The sooner the better. Something is wrong here.

1168
01:26:03,656 --> 01:26:06,147
No one has seen or knows anything about 3PO.

1169
01:26:06,283 --> 01:26:08,525
He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.

1170
01:26:08,661 --> 01:26:11,033
Relax. I'll talk to Lando...

1171
01:26:11,163 --> 01:26:13,536
and see what I can find out.

1172
01:26:13,666 --> 01:26:15,540
I don't trust Lando.

1173
01:26:15,668 --> 01:26:17,993
Well, I don't trust him either.

1174
01:26:18,129 --> 01:26:20,620
But he is my friend. Besides...

1175
01:26:20,756 --> 01:26:22,630
we'll soon be gone.

1176
01:26:22,758 --> 01:26:26,008
Then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

1177
01:27:00,796 --> 01:27:01,911
What happened?

1178
01:27:03,633 --> 01:27:04,913
Where?

1179
01:27:06,469 --> 01:27:08,296
Found him in a junk pile?

1180
01:27:08,429 --> 01:27:11,134
Oh, what a mess. Chewie,
you think you can repair him?

1181
01:27:13,309 --> 01:27:14,933
Lando's got people that can fix him.

1182
01:27:15,061 --> 01:27:16,519
No, thanks.

1183
01:27:16,646 --> 01:27:20,228
I'm sorry, am I interrupting anything?

1184
01:27:20,358 --> 01:27:22,315
Not really.

1185
01:27:25,821 --> 01:27:27,861
You look absolutely beautiful.

1186
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:31,276
You truly belong here with us among the clouds.

1187
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:32,821
Thank you.

1188
01:27:32,953 --> 01:27:35,824
Would you join me for a little refreshment?

1189
01:27:35,956 --> 01:27:37,534
Everyone's invited, of course.

1190
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,786
Having trouble with your droid?

1191
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,331
No, no problem.

1192
01:27:42,463 --> 01:27:43,459
Why?

1193
01:27:51,681 --> 01:27:53,969
You see, since we're a small operation...

1194
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:56,057
we don't fall into...

1195
01:27:56,185 --> 01:27:58,474
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

1196
01:27:58,604 --> 01:28:01,273
So you're part of the Mining Guild, then?

1197
01:28:01,399 --> 01:28:03,475
No, not actually. Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed.

1198
01:28:03,609 --> 01:28:05,483
Which is advantageous for everybody...

1199
01:28:05,611 --> 01:28:07,983
since our customers are anxious to avoid...

1200
01:28:08,114 --> 01:28:10,190
attracting attention to themselves.

1201
01:28:10,324 --> 01:28:12,400
Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out...

1202
01:28:12,535 --> 01:28:14,658
about this little operation, shut you down?

1203
01:28:14,787 --> 01:28:17,159
It's always been a danger that looms like
a shadow over everything we've built.

1204
01:28:17,289 --> 01:28:19,615
But things have developed that'll ensure security.

1205
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:24,578
I've just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever.

1206
01:28:33,597 --> 01:28:36,385
We would be honored if you would join us.

1207
01:28:41,897 --> 01:28:43,273
I had no choice.

1208
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:45,641
They arrived right before you did.

1209
01:28:45,776 --> 01:28:47,271
I'm sorry.

1210
01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:53,115
I'm sorry, too.

1211
01:29:08,674 --> 01:29:10,631
No, 3PO's with them.

1212
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,836
Just hang on. We're almost there.

1213
01:30:09,694 --> 01:30:11,520
Oh ah ooh ah.

1214
01:30:11,654 --> 01:30:14,026
Im terribly sorry.

1215
01:30:14,156 --> 01:30:16,529
I didn't mean to intrude.

1216
01:30:20,705 --> 01:30:23,030
No! Secret. Stormtroopers?

1217
01:30:23,165 --> 01:30:24,708
Here? We're in danger!

1218
01:30:24,834 --> 01:30:26,791
I must tell the others.

1219
01:30:26,919 --> 01:30:28,876
Oh, no, I've been shot!

1220
01:30:56,157 --> 01:30:57,532
Lord Vader.

1221
01:30:57,658 --> 01:31:01,027
You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt...

1222
01:31:01,162 --> 01:31:02,989
after I have Skywalker.

1223
01:31:03,122 --> 01:31:04,949
He's no good to me dead.

1224
01:31:05,082 --> 01:31:07,787
He will not be permanently damaged.

1225
01:31:10,338 --> 01:31:13,707
Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?

1226
01:31:13,841 --> 01:31:16,166
They must never again leave this city.

1227
01:31:16,302 --> 01:31:17,844
That was never a condition of our agreement...

1228
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:19,512
nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter.

1229
01:31:19,639 --> 01:31:24,799
Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly?

1230
01:31:24,935 --> 01:31:25,931
No.

1231
01:31:26,062 --> 01:31:27,307
Good. It would be unfortunate...

1232
01:31:27,438 --> 01:31:30,973
if I had to leave a garrison here.

1233
01:31:31,108 --> 01:31:35,438
This deal is getting worse all the time.

1234
01:31:37,323 --> 01:31:39,565
Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that.

1235
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:41,029
Oh!

1236
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:43,532
Something's not right because now I can't see.

1237
01:31:43,663 --> 01:31:47,743
Oh, oh, oh, that's much better.

1238
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,250
Wait! Wait!

1239
01:31:49,377 --> 01:31:51,250
Oh, my! What have you done?

1240
01:31:51,379 --> 01:31:53,252
I'm backwards...

1241
01:31:53,381 --> 01:31:55,254
you flea-bitten furball!

1242
01:31:55,383 --> 01:31:57,256
Only an overgrown mophead like you...

1243
01:31:57,385 --> 01:31:59,009
would be stupid enough--

1244
01:32:12,566 --> 01:32:14,109
I feel terrible.

1245
01:32:29,292 --> 01:32:31,664
Why are they doing this?

1246
01:32:34,797 --> 01:32:38,166
They never even asked me any questions.

1247
01:32:41,595 --> 01:32:43,173
Lando.

1248
01:32:47,059 --> 01:32:48,174
Get out of here, Lando.

1249
01:32:48,311 --> 01:32:50,137
Shut up and listen!

1250
01:32:50,271 --> 01:32:52,429
Vader's agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

1251
01:32:52,565 --> 01:32:54,225
They'll have to stay here,
but at least they'll be safe.

1252
01:32:54,358 --> 01:32:55,521
What about Han?

1253
01:32:55,651 --> 01:32:56,682
Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

1254
01:32:56,819 --> 01:32:57,934
Vader wants us all dead.

1255
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:59,233
He doesn't want you at all.

1256
01:32:59,363 --> 01:33:01,320
He's after somebody called Skywalker.

1257
01:33:01,449 --> 01:33:03,322
Luke.
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.

1258
01:33:03,451 --> 01:33:05,408
And we're the bait!

1259
01:33:05,536 --> 01:33:07,363
He's on his way.

1260
01:33:07,496 --> 01:33:10,533
You fixed us all real good, didn't you?

1261
01:33:10,666 --> 01:33:11,829
My friend.

1262
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:15,284
Stop!

1263
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:18,834
I've done all I can.

1264
01:33:18,966 --> 01:33:20,342
I'm sorry I couldn't do better...

1265
01:33:20,468 --> 01:33:22,045
but I've got my own problems.

1266
01:33:22,178 --> 01:33:23,506
Yeah.

1267
01:33:23,638 --> 01:33:25,429
You're a real hero.

1268
01:33:35,858 --> 01:33:38,396
You certainly have a way with people.

1269
01:33:52,792 --> 01:33:54,915
This facility is crude...

1270
01:33:55,044 --> 01:33:57,961
but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker...

1271
01:33:58,089 --> 01:34:00,461
for his journey to the emperor.

1272
01:34:00,591 --> 01:34:03,378
Lord Vader, ship approaching, X-wing class.

1273
01:34:03,511 --> 01:34:05,799
Good. Monitor Skywalker...

1274
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:07,887
and allow him to land.

1275
01:34:08,015 --> 01:34:11,349
Lord Vader, we only use this
facility for carbon freezing.

1276
01:34:11,477 --> 01:34:13,802
You put him in there, it might kill him.

1277
01:34:13,938 --> 01:34:15,313
I do not want...

1278
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:16,815
the emperor's prize damaged.

1279
01:34:16,941 --> 01:34:19,396
We will test it on Captain Solo.

1280
01:34:42,008 --> 01:34:44,759
If only you'd attached my legs...

1281
01:34:44,885 --> 01:34:46,795
I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position.

1282
01:34:46,929 --> 01:34:48,304
Now remember, Chewbacca...

1283
01:34:48,431 --> 01:34:50,304
you have a responsibility for me...

1284
01:34:50,433 --> 01:34:52,224
so don't do anything foolish.

1285
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:06,774
What's going on...

1286
01:35:06,907 --> 01:35:08,366
buddy?

1287
01:35:08,492 --> 01:35:11,410
You're being put into carbon freeze.

1288
01:35:11,537 --> 01:35:14,988
What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.

1289
01:35:15,124 --> 01:35:16,499
The Empire will compensate you...

1290
01:35:16,626 --> 01:35:17,657
if he dies.

1291
01:35:17,793 --> 01:35:19,667
Put him in.

1292
01:35:23,466 --> 01:35:25,339
Stop, Chewie, stop, stop!

1293
01:35:25,468 --> 01:35:28,919
Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die!

1294
01:35:29,055 --> 01:35:31,510
Hey! Hey! Listen to me, Chewie.

1295
01:35:31,641 --> 01:35:33,633
This won't help me.

1296
01:35:33,768 --> 01:35:34,966
Hey, save your strength.

1297
01:35:35,102 --> 01:35:37,676
There will be another time.

1298
01:35:37,813 --> 01:35:39,853
The princess--

1299
01:35:39,982 --> 01:35:41,726
You have to take care of her.

1300
01:35:43,986 --> 01:35:46,275
Do you hear me? Huh?

1301
01:35:59,877 --> 01:36:01,040
I love you.

1302
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:02,830
I know.

1303
01:36:32,034 --> 01:36:34,157
What's going on? Turn around!

1304
01:36:34,286 --> 01:36:35,615
Chewbacca, I can't see.

1305
01:37:33,429 --> 01:37:36,798
Oh, they've encased him in carbonite.

1306
01:37:36,932 --> 01:37:38,557
He should be quite well-protected...

1307
01:37:38,684 --> 01:37:40,593
if he survived the freezing process, that is.

1308
01:37:40,728 --> 01:37:43,563
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

1309
01:37:43,689 --> 01:37:45,516
Yes, he's alive.

1310
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:47,726
And in perfect hibernation.

1311
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:50,814
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

1312
01:37:50,946 --> 01:37:53,402
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

1313
01:37:55,868 --> 01:37:57,659
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

1314
01:37:57,787 --> 01:38:01,654
Good. See to it that he finds his way in here.

1315
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:10,333
Calrissian, take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1316
01:38:10,466 --> 01:38:12,589
You said they'd be left in the
city under my supervision.

1317
01:38:12,718 --> 01:38:14,758
I am altering the deal.

1318
01:38:14,887 --> 01:38:17,592
Pray I don't alter it any further.

1319
01:39:54,862 --> 01:39:57,400
Luke! Luke, don't, it's a trap!

1320
01:39:58,908 --> 01:39:59,987
It's a trap!

1321
01:40:45,287 --> 01:40:48,787
The Force is with you, young Skywalker.

1322
01:40:50,334 --> 01:40:53,252
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1323
01:41:54,607 --> 01:41:55,721
Well done.

1324
01:41:58,152 --> 01:42:00,524
Hold them in the security tower.

1325
01:42:00,655 --> 01:42:02,777
And keep it quiet. Move.

1326
01:42:07,745 --> 01:42:09,654
What do you think you're doing?

1327
01:42:09,789 --> 01:42:11,034
We're getting out of here.

1328
01:42:11,165 --> 01:42:12,992
I knew all along. It had to be a mistake.

1329
01:42:13,125 --> 01:42:15,877
Do you think that after what you did to Han,
we're going to trust you?

1330
01:42:16,879 --> 01:42:18,504
I had no choice.

1331
01:42:18,631 --> 01:42:20,173
What are you doing? Trust him! Trust him!

1332
01:42:20,299 --> 01:42:23,300
We understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.

1333
01:42:23,427 --> 01:42:24,969
I'm just trying to help.

1334
01:42:25,096 --> 01:42:27,384
We don't need any of your help.

1335
01:42:31,018 --> 01:42:32,049
Ha... Ha...

1336
01:42:32,186 --> 01:42:33,182
What?

1337
01:42:33,312 --> 01:42:34,343
Han...

1338
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,595
It sounds like Han.

1339
01:42:35,731 --> 01:42:37,225
There's still a chance...

1340
01:42:37,358 --> 01:42:39,066
to save Han...

1341
01:42:39,193 --> 01:42:41,518
at the east...

1342
01:42:41,654 --> 01:42:43,278
platform.

1343
01:42:43,406 --> 01:42:44,401
Chewie.

1344
01:42:47,034 --> 01:42:49,608
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1345
01:42:49,745 --> 01:42:51,489
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1346
01:42:51,622 --> 01:42:55,240
Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.

1347
01:43:10,349 --> 01:43:12,721
R2, R2, where have you been?

1348
01:43:12,852 --> 01:43:14,595
Wait. Turn around, you woolly--

1349
01:43:14,729 --> 01:43:18,561
Hurry! Hurry! We're trying to
save Han from the bounty hunter.

1350
01:43:20,109 --> 01:43:23,727
Well, at least you're still in one piece.

1351
01:43:23,863 --> 01:43:26,188
Look what's happened to me.

1352
01:43:38,169 --> 01:43:40,742
Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

1353
01:43:53,726 --> 01:43:56,051
You have learned much, young one.

1354
01:43:56,187 --> 01:43:58,310
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1355
01:44:09,408 --> 01:44:12,991
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1356
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:15,955
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1357
01:44:16,082 --> 01:44:17,280
No.

1358
01:44:24,423 --> 01:44:25,752
All too easy.

1359
01:44:31,097 --> 01:44:33,469
Perhaps you're not as strong...

1360
01:44:33,599 --> 01:44:35,426
as the emperor thought.

1361
01:44:36,644 --> 01:44:38,268
Impressive.

1362
01:44:40,231 --> 01:44:41,642
Most impressive.

1363
01:44:49,156 --> 01:44:51,232
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

1364
01:44:51,367 --> 01:44:53,573
You have controlled your fear.

1365
01:44:55,079 --> 01:44:56,538
Now...

1366
01:44:56,664 --> 01:44:59,202
release your anger.

1367
01:44:59,333 --> 01:45:02,619
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1368
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:14,175
Ohh!

1369
01:47:12,591 --> 01:47:14,798
The security code has been changed.

1370
01:47:14,927 --> 01:47:16,801
R2, you can tell the computer...

1371
01:47:16,929 --> 01:47:18,210
to override the security systems.

1372
01:47:18,347 --> 01:47:20,719
R2, hurry!

1373
01:47:23,227 --> 01:47:25,350
Attention. This is Lando Calrissian.

1374
01:47:25,479 --> 01:47:27,805
Attention. The Empire has taken control of the city.

1375
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:31,523
I advise everyone to leave before
more imperial troops arrive.

1376
01:47:38,034 --> 01:47:39,279
This way.

1377
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:41,782
Well, don't blame me. I'm an interpreter.

1378
01:47:41,912 --> 01:47:45,993
I'm not supposed to know a power
socket from a computer terminal.

1379
01:48:05,978 --> 01:48:07,389
Ah! We're not interested...

1380
01:48:07,521 --> 01:48:09,514
<i>in the Millennium Falcon's hyperdrive.</i>

1381
01:48:09,649 --> 01:48:11,356
It's fixed!

1382
01:48:13,235 --> 01:48:15,987
Just open the door, you stupid lump!

1383
01:48:24,789 --> 01:48:27,244
I never doubted you for a second.

1384
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:28,323
Wonderful!

1385
01:48:51,232 --> 01:48:53,271
Ouch! Oh! That hurts!

1386
01:48:53,401 --> 01:48:55,559
Bend down, you thoughtless-- Ow!

1387
01:49:00,116 --> 01:49:01,907
Leia!

1388
01:49:02,702 --> 01:49:04,077
Go!

1389
01:49:08,874 --> 01:49:12,575
I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me.

1390
01:49:13,879 --> 01:49:15,290
Of course I've looked better.

1391
01:50:08,976 --> 01:50:10,435
You are beaten.

1392
01:50:10,561 --> 01:50:12,637
It is useless to resist.

1393
01:50:12,772 --> 01:50:14,681
Don't let yourself be destroyed...

1394
01:50:14,815 --> 01:50:16,310
as Obi-Wan did.

1395
01:50:30,915 --> 01:50:33,702
There is no escape.

1396
01:50:33,834 --> 01:50:36,705
Don't make me destroy you.

1397
01:50:38,756 --> 01:50:43,252
Luke, you do not yet realize your importance.

1398
01:50:43,386 --> 01:50:46,256
You have only begun to discover your power.

1399
01:50:46,389 --> 01:50:47,931
Join me...

1400
01:50:48,057 --> 01:50:50,726
and I will complete your training.

1401
01:50:50,851 --> 01:50:53,093
With our combined strength...

1402
01:50:53,229 --> 01:50:56,099
we can end this destructive conflict...

1403
01:50:56,232 --> 01:50:58,770
and bring order to the galaxy.

1404
01:50:58,901 --> 01:51:00,360
I'll never join you!

1405
01:51:00,486 --> 01:51:03,238
If you only knew the power...

1406
01:51:03,364 --> 01:51:05,273
of the dark side.

1407
01:51:05,408 --> 01:51:07,614
Obi-Wan never told you...

1408
01:51:07,743 --> 01:51:09,617
what happened to your father.

1409
01:51:09,745 --> 01:51:11,405
He told me enough.

1410
01:51:14,041 --> 01:51:15,868
He told me you killed him.

1411
01:51:16,002 --> 01:51:17,282
No.

1412
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:19,745
<i>I am your father.</i>

1413
01:51:23,926 --> 01:51:25,966
No.

1414
01:51:26,095 --> 01:51:27,554
No.

1415
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:30,883
That's not true.

1416
01:51:31,017 --> 01:51:32,725
That's impossible!

1417
01:51:32,852 --> 01:51:36,102
Search your feelings. You know it to be true.

1418
01:51:37,356 --> 01:51:39,978
No!

1419
01:51:40,109 --> 01:51:43,395
No!

1420
01:51:43,529 --> 01:51:44,810
Luke.

1421
01:51:44,947 --> 01:51:47,070
You can destroy the emperor.

1422
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:49,073
He has foreseen this.

1423
01:51:49,201 --> 01:51:51,989
It is your destiny.

1424
01:51:52,121 --> 01:51:56,582
Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy...

1425
01:51:56,709 --> 01:51:58,333
as father and son.

1426
01:52:08,971 --> 01:52:10,596
Come with me.

1427
01:52:10,723 --> 01:52:13,640
It is the only way.

1428
01:53:19,583 --> 01:53:21,790
Ben.

1429
01:53:21,919 --> 01:53:23,995
Ben, please.

1430
01:53:33,014 --> 01:53:34,472
Ben.

1431
01:53:39,687 --> 01:53:41,015
Leia.

1432
01:53:51,157 --> 01:53:53,114
Hear me.

1433
01:53:54,785 --> 01:53:56,030
Leia.

1434
01:53:56,162 --> 01:53:57,656
Luke.

1435
01:53:59,832 --> 01:54:01,706
We've got to go back.

1436
01:54:01,834 --> 01:54:03,743
What?
- I know where Luke is.

1437
01:54:03,878 --> 01:54:04,992
What about those fighters?

1438
01:54:05,129 --> 01:54:07,169
Chewie, just do it.

1439
01:54:07,298 --> 01:54:08,709
But what about Vader?

1440
01:54:08,841 --> 01:54:10,216
All right, all right!

1441
01:54:17,892 --> 01:54:22,470
Alert my Stardestroyer to prepare for my arrival.

1442
01:54:31,822 --> 01:54:34,693
Look, someone's up there.

1443
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:37,233
It's Luke.

1444
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:38,864
Chewie, slow down.

1445
01:54:38,996 --> 01:54:40,870
Slow down. We'll get under him.

1446
01:54:40,998 --> 01:54:43,287
Lando, open the top hatch.

1447
01:54:58,140 --> 01:54:59,255
O.K.

1448
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:00,471
Easy, Chewie.

1449
01:55:22,248 --> 01:55:23,161
Lando?

1450
01:55:23,290 --> 01:55:24,370
<i>O.K., let's go.</i>

1451
01:55:41,642 --> 01:55:43,801
Oh, Leia.

1452
01:55:43,936 --> 01:55:45,845
All right, Chewie, let's go.

1453
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:22,385
I'll be back.

1454
01:56:29,023 --> 01:56:30,398
Stardestroyer.

1455
01:56:35,655 --> 01:56:38,027
All right, Chewie. Ready for light speed.

1456
01:56:38,157 --> 01:56:40,280
<i>If your people fixed the hyperdrive.</i>

1457
01:56:40,409 --> 01:56:42,735
All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.

1458
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:45,028
Punch it!

1459
01:56:55,007 --> 01:56:57,296
They told me they fixed it.

1460
01:56:57,426 --> 01:56:59,300
I trusted them!

1461
01:56:59,428 --> 01:57:01,919
It's not my fault!

1462
01:57:07,019 --> 01:57:10,056
They'll be in range of our
tractor beam in moments, lord.

1463
01:57:10,189 --> 01:57:11,683
Did your men deactivate...

1464
01:57:11,816 --> 01:57:13,855
<i>the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon?</i>

1465
01:57:13,985 --> 01:57:15,360
Yes, my lord.

1466
01:57:15,486 --> 01:57:17,395
Good. Prepare the boarding party...

1467
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:19,736
and set your weapons for "stun."

1468
01:57:19,865 --> 01:57:21,739
Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.

1469
01:57:21,867 --> 01:57:22,863
Yes, sir.

1470
01:57:24,578 --> 01:57:27,330
Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light speed?

1471
01:57:28,958 --> 01:57:30,785
We can't? How would you know...

1472
01:57:30,918 --> 01:57:31,949
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1473
01:57:35,256 --> 01:57:37,628
The city's central computer told you?

1474
01:57:37,758 --> 01:57:41,008
R2-D2, you know better than
to trust a strange computer.

1475
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:44,422
Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!

1476
01:57:54,859 --> 01:57:56,519
Luke.

1477
01:57:56,652 --> 01:57:58,894
Father.

1478
01:57:59,030 --> 01:58:02,778
Son, come with me.

1479
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:06,119
Ben.

1480
01:58:07,455 --> 01:58:09,412
Why didn't you tell me?

1481
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:16,544
Chewie!

1482
01:58:27,767 --> 01:58:28,965
It's Vader.

1483
01:58:34,815 --> 01:58:38,267
Luke, it is your destiny.

1484
01:58:43,115 --> 01:58:45,357
Ben.

1485
01:58:45,493 --> 01:58:47,900
Why didn't you tell me?

1486
01:58:54,669 --> 01:58:56,495
Alert all commands.

1487
01:58:56,629 --> 01:58:58,586
Ready for the tractor beam.

1488
01:59:00,967 --> 01:59:02,840
R2, come back at once!

1489
01:59:02,969 --> 01:59:04,795
You haven't finished with me yet.

1490
01:59:04,929 --> 01:59:06,672
You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive.

1491
01:59:06,806 --> 01:59:08,181
Chewbacca can do it.

1492
01:59:08,307 --> 01:59:09,683
I'm standing here in pieces...

1493
01:59:09,809 --> 01:59:12,975
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1494
01:59:15,481 --> 01:59:17,604
You did it!

1495
02:00:14,498 --> 02:00:17,072
Luke, we're ready for take-off.

1496
02:00:17,209 --> 02:00:18,324
<i>Good luck, Lando.</i>

1497
02:00:18,461 --> 02:00:20,584
<i>When we find Jabba the Hutt...</i>

1498
02:00:20,713 --> 02:00:21,744
<i>and that bounty hunter...</i>

1499
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:23,340
<i>we'll contact you.</i>

1500
02:00:23,466 --> 02:00:26,087
I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1501
02:00:26,218 --> 02:00:28,294
Princess, we'll find Han.

1502
02:00:28,429 --> 02:00:29,627
I promise.

1503
02:00:29,764 --> 02:00:31,970
Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal.

1504
02:00:32,099 --> 02:00:33,807
Take care, you two.

1505
02:00:33,934 --> 02:00:35,761
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>

1506
02:00:38,761 --> 02:00:42,761
