1
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,358
Sméagol!

2
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,670
I've got one!

3
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,191
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!

4
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,352
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

5
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,992
Déagol!

6
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,792
Déagol?

7
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,390
Déagol.

8
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,551
Give us that, Déagol, my love.

9
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,548
Why?

10
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,750
Because...

11
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,515
...it's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,748
My precious.

13
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,798
They cursed us.

14
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,279
Murderer.

15
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,795
"Murderer" they called us.

16
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,556
They cursed us
and drove us away.

17
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,278
Gollum.

18
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,078
Gollum.

19
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,117
Gollum.

20
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,398
And we wept, precious.

21
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,996
We wept to be so alone.

22
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,109
--and cool
So nice for feet

23
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,278
And we only wish
To catch a fish

24
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,557
So juicy sweet

25
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,039
And we forgot the taste of bread...

26
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,670
...the sound of trees...

27
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,592
...the softness of the wind.

28
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,638
We even forgot our own name.

29
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,595
My precious.

30
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,190
Wake up!

31
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,792
Wake up!

32
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,678
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,637
We must go, yes.

34
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,360
We must go at once.

35
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,718
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,274
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,272
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,873
No.

39
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,871
It isn't.

40
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,952
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,588
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,796
Come on!

43
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,270
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,715
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

45
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,633
No time to lose, silly.

46
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,268
Here.

47
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,112
What about you?

48
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,511
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

49
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,399
Sam.

50
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,359
All right.

51
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,909
We don't have that much left.

52
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,833
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

53
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,718
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

54
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,233
I've rationed it.

55
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,312
There should be enough.

56
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,549
For what?

57
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,832
The journey home.

58
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,590
Come, Hobbitses.

59
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,717
Very close now.

60
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,997
Very close to Mordor.

61
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,720
No safe places here.

62
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,950
Hurry.

63
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,838
It's good.

64
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,392
Definitely from the Shire.

65
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,556
Longbottom Leaf.

66
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,832
I feel like I'm back at
The Green Dragon.

67
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,997
-Green Dragon.
-A mug of ale in my hand.

68
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,551
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

69
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,430
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

70
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,632
Welcome, my lords...

71
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,950
...to lsengard!

72
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,915
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

73
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,870
...and now we find you feasting
and...and smoking!

74
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,077
We are sitting on a field of victory...

75
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,596
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

76
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,315
The salted pork is particularly good.

77
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,115
Salted pork?

78
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,556
-Hobbits.
-We're under orders from Treebeard...

79
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,439
...who's taken over management
of lsengard.

80
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,758
Young Master Gandalf.

81
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,311
I'm glad you've come.

82
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,712
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

83
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,395
But there is a wizard to manage here...

84
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,471
... Iocked in his tower.

85
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,314
Show yourself.

86
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,198
Be careful.

87
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,520
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

88
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,716
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

89
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,836
No.

90
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,390
We need him alive.

91
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,828
We need him to talk.

92
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,679
You have fought many wars
and slain many men, Théoden King...

93
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,273
...and made peace afterwards.

94
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,195
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

95
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,432
Can we not have peace, you and l?

96
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,431
We shall have peace.

97
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,316
We shall have peace...

98
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,359
...when you answer
for the burning of the Westfold...

99
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,159
...and the children that lie dead there!

100
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,873
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers...

101
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,031
...whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

102
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,590
...against the gates of the Hornburg,
are avenged!

103
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,438
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

104
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,470
...we shall have peace.

105
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,714
Gibbets and crows?

106
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,234
Dotard!

107
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,359
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

108
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,709
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

109
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,678
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...

110
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,674
...along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the Five Wizards!

111
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,673
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

112
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,115
Thousands more are now at risk.

113
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,555
But you could save them, Saruman.

114
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,915
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

115
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,231
So you have come here for information.

116
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,832
I have some for you.

117
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,913
Something festers
in the heart of Middle-earth.

118
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,230
Something that you have failed to see.

119
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,996
But the Great Eye has seen it.

120
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,549
Even now he presses his advantage.

121
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,437
His attack will come soon.

122
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,596
You're all going to die.

123
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,117
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

124
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,717
You cannot think that this Ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

125
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,716
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

126
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,515
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him...

127
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,516
...those he professes to love.

128
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,877
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

129
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,952
...before you sent him to his doom?

130
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,796
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

131
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,190
I've heard enough!

132
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,112
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

133
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,192
No.

134
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,756
Come down, Saruman...

135
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,708
-...and your life will be spared.
-Save your pity and your mercy.

136
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,154
I have no use for it!

137
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,399
Saruman...

138
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,437
...your staff is broken.

139
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,190
Gríma, you need not follow him.

140
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,880
You were not always as you are now.

141
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,759
You were once a Man of Rohan.

142
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,114
Come down.

143
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,874
A Man of Rohan?

144
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,910
What is the house of Rohan...

145
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,595
... but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

146
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,309
...and their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

147
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,989
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.

148
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,991
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

149
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,878
Gríma...

150
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,477
...come down.

151
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,153
Be free of him.

152
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,154
-Free? He will never be free.
-No.

153
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,034
Get down, cur!

154
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,948
Saruman!

155
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,634
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

156
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,190
Tell us what you know!

157
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,668
You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you
where your doom will be decided.

158
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,230
I will not be held prisoner here.

159
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,719
Send word to all our allies...

160
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,678
...and to every corner of Middle-earth
that still stands free.

161
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,192
The enemy moves against us.
We need to know where he will strike.

162
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,388
The filth of Saruman...

163
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,235
... is washing away.

164
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,757
Trees will come back to live here.

165
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,310
Young trees.

166
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,596
-Wiild trees.
-Pippin!

167
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,750
Bless my bark!

168
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,717
Peregrin Took!

169
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,394
I'll take that, my lad.

170
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,357
Quickly, now.

171
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,838
Tonight we remember those who
gave their blood to defend this country.

172
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,436
Hail the victorious dead.

173
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,953
Hail!

174
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,311
No pauses.

175
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,473
-No spills.
-And no regurgitation.

176
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,552
So it's a drinking game?

177
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,634
Last one standing wins.

178
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,711
What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

179
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,233
To victory!

180
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,992
I am happy for you.

181
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,669
He is an honourable man.

182
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,435
You are both honourable men.

183
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,320
It was not Théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

184
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,912
Don't listen to me.

185
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,153
You are young.

186
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,550
And tonight is for you.

187
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,912
Here, here.

188
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,037
It's the Dwarves that go swimming
with little, hairy women.

189
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,394
I feel something.

190
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,829
A slight tingle in my fingers.

191
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,033
I think it's affecting me.

192
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,518
What did I say?

193
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,877
He can't hold his liquor.

194
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,194
Game over.

195
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,636
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

196
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,588
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

197
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,958
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

198
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,874
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink 'em by the flagon

199
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,077
But the only brew for the brave and true

200
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,828
Pippin!

201
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,192
But the only brew for the brave and true

202
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,114
Comes from The Green Dragon

203
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,439
Thank you! I win!

204
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,509
No news of Frodo?

205
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,036
No word. Nothing.

206
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,910
We have time.

207
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,511
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

208
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,231
Do we know that?

209
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,558
What does your heart tell you?

210
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,517
That Frodo is alive.

211
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,318
Yes.

212
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,870
Yes, he's alive.

213
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,759
Too risky. Too risky.

214
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,114
Thieves.

215
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,236
They stole it from us.

216
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,756
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

217
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,439
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

218
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,034
Mustn't ruin it now.

219
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,191
But they knows.

220
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,157
They knows.

221
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,834
They suspects us.

222
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,390
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

223
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,996
Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

224
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,915
No. Not.

225
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,153
Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

226
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,950
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

227
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,554
And we will.

228
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,599
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

229
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,360
It's ours!

230
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,080
Ours!

231
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,913
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

232
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,356
Patience! Patience, my love.

233
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,718
First we must lead them to her.

234
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,350
We lead them to the Wiinding Stair.

235
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,080
Yes, the stairs. And then?

236
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,118
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

237
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:38,435
...until we come to the tunnel.

238
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,792
And when they go in...

239
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,633
...there's no coming out.

240
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,273
She's always hungry.

241
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,039
She always needs to feed.

242
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,553
She must eat.

243
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,756
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

244
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,559
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

245
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,718
No.

246
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,396
Not very nice at all, my love.

247
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,233
She hungers for sweeter meats.

248
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,152
Hobbit meat.

249
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,950
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

250
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,078
...then we will find it.

251
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,392
And take it for me!

252
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,433
For us.

253
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,798
Yes. We meant "for us."

254
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,270
Gollum. Gollum.

255
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,752
The precious will be ours...

256
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,232
...once the Hobbitses are dead!

257
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,119
You treacherous little toad!

258
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,915
No! No! Master!

259
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,638
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

260
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,040
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

261
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,193
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

262
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,108
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

263
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,793
...who hates Sméagol...

264
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,633
...and who makes up nasty lies.

265
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,360
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

266
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,948
Sam!

267
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,515
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

268
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,194
-You scare him off, we're lost!
-I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

269
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,397
-I won't wait around for him to kill us!
-I'm not sending him away.

270
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,994
You don't see it, do you?

271
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,753
He's a villain.

272
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,190
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

273
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,753
I need you on my side.

274
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,750
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

275
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,033
I know, Sam. I know.

276
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,471
Trust me.

277
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,915
Come, Sméagol.

278
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,479
What time is it?

279
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,153
Not yet dawn.

280
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,712
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

281
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,714
...climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

282
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,275
I stood upon the brink.

283
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,197
It was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet.

284
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,713
A light shone behind me...

285
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,629
...but I could not turn.

286
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,076
I could only stand there, waiting.

287
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,074
Night changes many thoughts.

288
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,510
Sleep, Éowyn.

289
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,190
Sleep...

290
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,597
...while you can.

291
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,955
The stars are veiled.

292
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,276
Something stirs in the east.

293
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,912
A sleepless malice.

294
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,513
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

295
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,994
What are you doing?

296
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,839
Pippin!

297
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,712
Pippin?

298
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,354
Pippin.

299
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,560
-What, are you mad?
-I just want to look at it.

300
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,789
Just one more time.

301
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,031
Put it back.

302
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,598
Pippin.

303
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,273
No!

304
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,354
Pippin.

305
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,709
He is here.

306
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,075
I see you.

307
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,518
Pippin!

308
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,199
Help! Gandalf, help!

309
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,677
Someone help him!

310
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,949
Pippin!

311
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,234
Fool of a Took!

312
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,596
Look at me.

313
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,439
Gandalf, forgive me.

314
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,397
Look at me.

315
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,312
What did you see?

316
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,671
A tree.

317
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,397
There was a white tree...

318
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,993
...in a courtyard of stone.

319
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,908
It was dead.

320
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,672
The city was burning.

321
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,071
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

322
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,676
I saw....

323
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,239
I saw him.

324
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,270
I could hear his voice in my head.

325
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,749
And what did you tell him?

326
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,672
Speak!

327
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,717
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

328
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,279
He hurt me.

329
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,795
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

330
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,515
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

331
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,470
A fool...

332
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,835
...but an honest fool he remains.

333
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,670
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

334
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,955
We've been strangely fortunate.

335
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,829
Pippin saw in the palantír
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

336
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,508
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

337
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,675
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

338
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,070
He knows the heir of Elendil
has come forth.

339
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,276
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

340
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,069
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

341
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,077
Sauron fears this.

342
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,392
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

343
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,829
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

344
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,356
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

345
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,274
If the beacons of Gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

346
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,276
Tell me...

347
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,069
...why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

348
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,552
What do we owe Gondor?

349
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,596
-I will go.
-No!

350
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,797
-They must be warned.
-They will be.

351
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,514
You must come to Minas Tirith
by another road.

352
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,318
Follow the river.
Look to the black ships.

353
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,117
Understand this:

354
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,795
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

355
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,231
I ride for Minas Tirith...

356
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,960
...and I won't be going alone.

357
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,155
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

358
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,712
Hurry! Hurry!

359
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,513
Where are we going?

360
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,874
Why did you look?

361
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,679
Why do you always have to look?

362
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,798
-I don't know. I can't help it.
-You never can.

363
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,593
I'm sorry, all right?

364
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,398
-I won't do it again.
-Don't you understand?

365
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,997
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

366
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,755
He's going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here.

367
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,680
And you--? You're coming with me?

368
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,153
Merry?

369
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,548
Come on.

370
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,159
How far is Minas Tirith?

371
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,834
Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.

372
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,356
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

373
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,473
Here.

374
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,358
Something for the road.

375
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,077
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

376
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,074
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, Pippin.

377
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,629
But-- But we'll see each other soon.

378
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,229
-Won't we?
-I don't know.

379
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,116
I don't know what's going to happen.

380
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,918
-Merry.
-Run, Shadowfax.

381
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,479
Show us the meaning of haste.

382
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,471
Merry!

383
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,589
Merry!

384
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,073
He's always followed me...

385
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,676
...everywhere I went...

386
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,718
...since before we were tweens.

387
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,594
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble...

388
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,751
...but I was always there to get him out.

389
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,917
Now he's gone.

390
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,318
Just like Frodo and Sam.

391
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,559
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

392
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,312
They're a most hardy folk.

393
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,389
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

394
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,475
Take her by the safest road.

395
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,029
A ship lies anchored
in the Grey Havens.

396
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,909
It waits to carry her across the sea.

397
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,311
The last journey of Arwen Undómiel.

398
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,198
There is nothing for you here...

399
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,796
...only death.

400
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,028
Lady Arwen...

401
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,751
...we cannot delay.

402
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,314
My lady!

403
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,434
-Tell me what you have seen.
-Arwen.

404
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,477
You have the gift of foresight.

405
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,358
What did you see?

406
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,157
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

407
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,716
But there is also life.

408
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,439
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

409
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,474
That future is almost gone.

410
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,551
But it is not lost.

411
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,156
Nothing is certain.

412
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,394
Some things are certain.

413
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,759
If I leave him now...

414
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,434
... I will regret it forever.

415
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,710
It is time.

416
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,389
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

417
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,836
A light from the shadow shall spring

418
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,151
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

419
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,312
The crownless again shall be king

420
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,876
Re-forge the sword.

421
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,914
Your hands are cold.

422
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,152
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

423
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,271
This was my choice.

424
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,235
Whether by your will or not...

425
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,638
...there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

426
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,639
We've just passed
into the realm of Gondor.

427
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,950
Minas Tirith.

428
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,750
City of kings.

429
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,558
Make way!

430
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,312
It's the tree.

431
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,072
Gandalf. Gandalf.

432
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,390
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

433
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,312
The tree of the king.

434
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,040
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

435
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,760
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

436
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,870
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

437
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,029
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

438
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,790
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

439
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,279
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

440
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,749
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

441
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,915
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

442
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,716
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

443
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,871
Perhaps you come to explain this.

444
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,637
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

445
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,398
Boromir died to save us...

446
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,152
...my kinsman and me.

447
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,676
-He fell defending us from many foes.
-Pippin.

448
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,270
I offer you my service, such as it is...

449
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,711
...in payment of this debt.

450
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,997
This is my first command to you.

451
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,990
How did you escape
and my son did not...

452
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,550
...so mighty a man as he was?

453
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,397
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

454
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,471
...and Boromir was pierced by many.

455
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,078
Get up.

456
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,677
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

457
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,792
...but it is not now.

458
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,596
War is coming.

459
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,152
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

460
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,313
...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

461
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,156
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

462
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,632
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

463
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,550
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

464
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,632
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

465
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,673
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

466
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,798
I have seen more than you know.

467
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,032
Wiith your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

468
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,953
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

469
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,669
I knowwho rides with Théoden of Rohan.

470
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:24,551
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

471
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,350
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

472
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,832
... Iast of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

473
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,597
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

474
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,992
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

475
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,678
Come.

476
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,748
All has turned to vain ambition.

477
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,230
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

478
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,673
A thousand years
this city has stood.

479
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,029
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

480
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,316
And the White Tree,
the tree of the king...

481
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,959
...will never bloom again.

482
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,351
-Why are they still guarding it?
-They guard it because they have hope.

483
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,557
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

484
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,271
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

485
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,238
... before it fell into decay.

486
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,517
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

487
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,798
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

488
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,831
...and counted the old names
of their descent...

489
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,673
...dearer than the names of their sons.

490
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,675
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

491
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,960
...or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

492
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,749
And so the people of Gondor
fell into ruin.

493
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,910
The line of kings failed.

494
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,875
The White Tree withered.

495
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,553
The rule of Gondor was given over
to lesser men.

496
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,034
Mordor.

497
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,035
Yes, there it lies.

498
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,037
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

499
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,552
A storm is coming.

500
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,998
This is not the weather of the world.

501
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,276
This is a device of Sauron's making.

502
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,035
A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host.

503
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,955
The Orcs of Mordor
have no love of daylight...

504
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,872
...so he covers the face of the sun...

505
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,635
...to ease their passage
along the road to war.

506
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,951
When the Shadow of Mordor
reaches this city...

507
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,278
...it will begin.

508
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,393
Well...

509
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,034
... Minas Tirith...

510
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,233
...very impressive.

511
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,914
-So where are we off to next?
-Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

512
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,196
There's no leaving this city.

513
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,512
Help must come to us.

514
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,520
It must be getting near teatime.

515
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,229
Leastways, it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime.

516
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,836
We're not in decent places.

517
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,354
Mr. Frodo?

518
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,429
What is it?

519
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,075
It's just a feeling.

520
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,470
I don't think I'll be coming back.

521
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,234
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

522
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,637
That's just morbid thinking.

523
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,435
We're going there and back again...

524
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,795
...just like Mr. Bilbo.

525
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,756
You'll see.

526
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,070
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

527
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,159
Long ago, when there was a king.

528
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,679
Mr. Frodo, look.

529
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,879
The king has got a crown again.

530
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:03,633
Come on, Hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

531
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,679
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

532
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,913
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

533
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,837
-Do they?
-You're in the service of the steward now.

534
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,231
You'll have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took.

535
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,509
Ridiculous Hobbit.

536
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,756
Guard of the Citadel.

537
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,632
Thank you.

538
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,790
There's no more stars.

539
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,429
Is it time?

540
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,232
Yes.

541
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,352
It's so quiet.

542
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,393
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

543
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,273
I don't want to be in a battle...

544
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,835
... but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

545
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,710
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

546
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,992
There never was much hope.

547
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,552
Just a fool's hope.

548
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,873
Our enemy is ready.

549
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,600
His full strength's gathered.

550
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,116
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

551
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,192
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

552
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,954
...mercenaries from the coast.

553
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,588
All will answer Mordor's call.

554
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,239
Come on.

555
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,517
This will be the end of Gondor
as we know it.

556
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,911
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

557
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,992
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

558
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,675
...the last defense of this city
will be gone.

559
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,719
But we have the White Wiizard.
That's got to count for something.

560
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,873
Gandalf?

561
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,955
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

562
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,075
...the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.

563
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,189
The one they say no living man can kill.

564
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,230
The Wiitch King of Angmar.

565
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,555
You've met him before.

566
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,668
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

567
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,554
He is the lord of the Nazgûl...

568
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,355
...the greatest of the Nine.

569
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,990
Minas Morgul is his lair.

570
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,710
The Dead City.

571
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,874
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

572
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,870
Quick. Quick.

573
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,874
They will see. They will see.

574
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,834
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

575
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,709
The way into Mordor.

576
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,032
The secret stair.

577
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,715
Climb.

578
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,799
-No, Mr. Frodo!
-Not that way!

579
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,193
-What's it doing?
-No.

580
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,318
-They're calling me.
-No.

581
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,593
Hide! Hide!

582
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,079
I can feel his blade.

583
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,316
We come to it at last.

584
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,833
The great battle of our time.

585
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,517
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

586
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,878
The board is set.

587
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,474
The pieces are moving.

588
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,480
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

589
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,200
And then it's into the tunnel.

590
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,432
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

591
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,599
You listen to me,
and you listen good and proper.

592
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,558
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

593
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,233
One sniff something's not right...

594
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,437
...one hair stands up
on the back of my head, it's over.

595
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,200
No more slinker. No more stinker.

596
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,034
You're gone. Got it?

597
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,791
I'm watching you.

598
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,831
What was that about?

599
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,309
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

600
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,433
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

601
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,991
Another opportunity for one
of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

602
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,153
You must not fail me.

603
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,958
It's been very quiet across the river.

604
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,350
The Orcs are lying low.

605
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,431
The garrison may have moved out.

606
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,114
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

607
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,431
If the Orcs attack from the north,
we'll have some warning.

608
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,869
Quiet.

609
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,677
We need 1 0 more.

610
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,599
Kill him!

611
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,509
They're not coming from the north.

612
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:14,032
To the river. Quick. Quick.
Go. Come on.

613
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,873
Faster.

614
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,755
Draw swords.

615
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,548
Hold! Hold them!

616
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,357
What?

617
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,753
Amon Dîn.

618
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,232
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit.

619
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,399
Hope is kindled.

620
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,198
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

621
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,918
Gondor calls for aid.

622
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,798
And Rohan will answer.

623
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,873
Muster the Rohirrim.

624
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,237
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

625
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,598
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

626
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:33,834
On the third,
we ride for Gondor and war.

627
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,034
-Forward.
-Very good, sir.

628
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,474
-Gamling.
-My lord.

629
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,153
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

630
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,356
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

631
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,033
I will.

632
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,997
-Wiill you ride with us?
-Just to the encampment.

633
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,914
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

634
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,031
The men have found their captain.

635
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,397
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

636
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,073
You have given us hope.

637
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,037
Excuse me.

638
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,753
I have a sword.

639
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,359
Please accept it.

640
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,752
I offer you my service, Théoden King.

641
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,031
And gladly I accept it.

642
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,993
You shall be Meriadoc,
esquire of Rohan.

643
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:37,829
Horse-Men.

644
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,873
I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves,
fully armed and filthy.

645
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,073
Your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war.

646
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,516
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

647
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,550
So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...

648
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:15,429
...the doom of our time will be decided.

649
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,233
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

650
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,790
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land!

651
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,997
Faramir!

652
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:19,589
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

653
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:23,118
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

654
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,670
Nazgûl.

655
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,315
Take cover!

656
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,914
Nazgûl!

657
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:44,595
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

658
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,717
Fall back!

659
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:03,871
-Retreat! Retreat!
-Run for your lives!

660
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,272
The age of Men is over.

661
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:36,833
The time of the Orc has come.

662
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,350
-Keep going.
-It's the Nazgûl.

663
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,195
Take cover, my lord!

664
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,754
It's coming!

665
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,311
-It's Mithrandir.
-The White Rider!

666
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,959
Pull!

667
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,269
Mithrandir.

668
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,112
They broke through our defenses.

669
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,396
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

670
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,433
-Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
-lt is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

671
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,957
-Long has he foreseen this doom.
-Foreseen and done nothing.

672
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,509
Faramir?

673
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:19,035
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

674
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,316
No.

675
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,079
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

676
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:28,196
-Where? When?
-ln lthilien.

677
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,351
Not two days ago.

678
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,078
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

679
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,274
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

680
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,675
What does that mean?

681
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,550
-What's wrong?
-Faramir, tell me everything.

682
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,676
Tell me all you know.

683
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,076
This is how you would serve your city?

684
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,391
You would risk its utter ruin?

685
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,913
I did what I judged to be right.

686
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,478
What you judged to be right.

687
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:09,712
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

688
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,150
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

689
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,199
Hidden.

690
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,239
Dark and deep in the vaults...

691
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,470
... not to be used.

692
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:35,156
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

693
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,556
I would not use the Ring.

694
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,678
Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin
and I alone could save her.

695
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,630
Ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious...

696
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,950
...as a king of old.

697
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:53,275
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

698
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,035
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

699
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,674
Boromir would not
have brought the Ring.

700
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,072
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

701
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,390
-You know nothing of this matter!
-He would have kept it for his own.

702
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,270
And when he returned...

703
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,952
...you would not have known your son.

704
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,554
Boromir was loyal to me!

705
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,188
Not some wizard's pupil!

706
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,274
Father?

707
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,271
My son.

708
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,759
Leave me.

709
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,394
Careful, master. Careful.

710
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,518
Very far to fall.

711
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,674
Very dangerous are the stairs.

712
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,674
Come, master.

713
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:03,277
Come to Sméagol.

714
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,793
Mr. Frodo.

715
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,239
Get back, you!

716
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,516
Don't touch him!

717
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:22,199
Why does he hates poor Sméagol?

718
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,909
What has Sméagol ever done to him?

719
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,355
Master?

720
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,430
Master carries heavy burden.

721
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:37,799
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

722
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:41,077
Fat one cannot know.

723
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,679
Sméagol look after master.

724
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,956
He wants it.

725
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,477
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

726
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:58,873
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

727
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,749
The fat one will take it from you.

728
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,832
Send forth all legions.

729
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,879
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

730
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,552
Slay them all.

731
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:28,712
-What of the wizard?
-I will break him.

732
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,229
Where are Théoden's riders?

733
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,868
Wiill Rohan's army come?

734
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,190
Mithrandir.

735
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,909
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

736
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,114
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

737
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:58,592
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

738
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,193
It was well-done.

739
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:07,119
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

740
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,274
You are to join the tower guard.

741
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,678
I didn't think they would find any livery
that would fit me.

742
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,195
Once belonged to a young boy
of the city.

743
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,839
A very foolish one...

744
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,073
...who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

745
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,879
-This was yours?
-Yes, it was mine.

746
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,758
My father had it made for me.

747
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,034
Well...

748
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,111
... I'm taller than you were then.

749
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,477
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,
except sideways.

750
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,276
Never fitted me either.

751
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,159
Boromir was always the soldier.

752
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,349
They were so alike, he and my father.

753
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,918
Proud.

754
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,229
Stubborn even.

755
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,353
But strong.

756
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,837
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

757
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,795
And one day your father will see it.

758
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,429
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

759
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,033
... in peace or war...

760
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,995
...in living or dying...

761
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,514
...from....

762
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,753
From this hour henceforth...

763
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,751
... until my lord release me...

764
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,316
...or death take me.

765
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,269
And I shall not forget it...

766
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,671
...nor fail to reward
that which is given.

767
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,155
Fealty with love.

768
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,792
Valour with honour.

769
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,517
Disloyalty with vengeance.

770
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,713
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

771
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,519
...defenses that your brother
long held intact.

772
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,069
-What would you have me do?
-I will not yield...

773
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,913
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

774
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,672
Osgiliath must be retaken.

775
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,796
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

776
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:19,113
Much must be risked in war.

777
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:25,428
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

778
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,517
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

779
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,159
...that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

780
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,112
Yes.

781
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,876
I wish that.

782
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,309
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

783
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,878
... I will do what I can
in his stead.

784
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:12,998
If I should return,
think better of me, Father.

785
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,470
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

786
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,590
What are you up to?

787
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,954
Sneaking off, are we?

788
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,392
Sneaking?

789
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,430
Sneaking?

790
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,837
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

791
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,869
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

792
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,110
...and they say "sneak."

793
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:02,188
Sneak?

794
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,394
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

795
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:08,074
-Very nice, very nice.
-All right. All right!

796
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,396
You just startled me is all.

797
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,632
What were you doing?

798
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,236
Sneaking.

799
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,558
Fine. Have it your own way.

800
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:25,109
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

801
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,357
We have to be moving on.

802
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,833
It's dark still.

803
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,116
It's always dark here.

804
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,031
It's gone!

805
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,953
-The Elven bread.
-What?

806
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,519
That's all we have left.

807
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,829
He took it. He must have!

808
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,437
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor Sméagol.

809
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,398
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.

810
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,597
You're a lying rat!
What did you do with it?!

811
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,239
He doesn't eat it.

812
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,430
-He can't have taken it.
-Look.

813
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,192
What's this?

814
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,957
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

815
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,232
He took it.

816
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:24,079
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

817
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,958
That's a filthy lie!

818
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,236
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

819
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,594
-Sam!
-Call me--

820
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,954
Stop it!

821
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,069
Sam!

822
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,790
-I'll kill him!
-Sam! No!

823
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:44,113
Oh, my-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so-- So angry.

824
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,316
Here, just--
Let's just rest a bit.

825
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,471
-I'm all right.
-No.

826
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:51,598
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

827
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,796
It's that Gollum.

828
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,598
It's this place.

829
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,228
It's that thing around your neck.

830
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,828
I could help a bit.

831
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,560
I could carry it for a while.

832
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,392
Carry it for a while.

833
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,754
I could carry it... I could carry it.

834
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:14,593
Share the load...Share the load...
the load...the load.

835
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,909
Get away!

836
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,593
I don't want to keep it.

837
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,951
I just want to help.

838
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,434
See? See?

839
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,876
He wants it for himself.

840
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,678
Shut up, you!

841
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,952
Go away!
Get out of here!

842
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,872
No, Sam.

843
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,234
It's you.

844
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,918
I'm sorry, Sam.

845
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,839
But he's a liar.

846
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,560
He's poisoned you against me.

847
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,751
You can't help me anymore.

848
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,437
You don't mean that.

849
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,558
Go home.

850
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:19,038
Faramir!

851
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,031
Faramir!

852
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,436
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

853
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,516
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

854
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:30,470
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

855
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,878
This is the city of the Men of Númenor.

856
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,153
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

857
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:40,392
...her memory, her wisdom.

858
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,956
Your father loves you, Faramir.

859
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:49,518
He will remember it
before the end.

860
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,759
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?
