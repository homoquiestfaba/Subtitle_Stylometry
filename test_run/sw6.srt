We're going to the Dagobah system.

to an old friend.

380
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,690
Rise, my friend.

381

You've done well, Lord Vader.

383

And now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.

384
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,797
Yes, my master.

385
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:02,216
Patience, my friend.

386
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:06,470
In time, he will seek you out.

387
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:10,349
And when he does,
you must bring him before me.

388
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:13,435
He has grown strong.

389
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:19,400
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

Vader.

00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:41,333
You must confront Vader.

is Darth Vader my father?

Yes.

Rest.

430
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:14,116
Yoda, I must know.

431

Your father he is.

00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:29,214

Yes.

No.

Unfortunate that you rushed to face him,

439
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,532
that incomplete was your training,

440
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,287

Why didn't you tell me?

471
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:08,809
You told me Vader
betrayed and murdered my father.

472
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:13,980
Your father was seduced by
the dark side of the Force.

473
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:18,985
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

474
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:23,323
When that happened, the good man
who was your father was destroyed.

475
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:26,910
So what I told you was true,

476
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,787
from a certain point of view.

477
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:31,415
A certain point of view?

478
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:35,210
Luke, you're going to find that
many of the truths we cling to

479
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,463
depend greatly on our own point of view.

480
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:42,134
Anakin was a good friend.

481
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:46,638
When I first knew him,
your father was already a great pilot,

482
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:50,016
but I was amazed
how strongly the Force was with him.

483
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:53,687
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

484
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:58,817
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

485
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,235
I was wrong.

486
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:02,946
There is still good in him.

487
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,866
He's more machine now than man,

488
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,701
twisted and evil.

489
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:11,747
I can't do it, Ben.

490
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:13,957
You cannot escape your destiny.

491
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:17,335
You must face Darth Vader again.

492
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:19,963
I can't kill my own father.

493
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:27,304
Then the Emperor has already won.

494
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:30,807
You were our only hope.

495
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:33,477
Yoda spoke of another.

496
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,898
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

497
00:47:38,732 --> 00:47:40,734
- But I have no sister.
- Hmm.

498
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:43,653
To protect you both from the Emperor,

499
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:47,491
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.

500
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:50,035
The Emperor knew, as I did,

501
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:53,789
if Anakin were to have any offspring,

502
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:56,374
they would be a threat to him.

503
00:47:56,583 --> 00:48:01,797
That is the reason why
your sister remains safely anonymous.

504
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,174

505
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,842
Leia's my sister.

Your insight serves you well.

507
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:12,766
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

508
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:18,104
They do you credit, but they
could be made to serve the Emperor.

509
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:43,338
Well, look at you, a general, huh?

510
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,756
Someone must have told them

511
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,842
about my little manoeuvre
at the Battle of Tanaab.

512
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:49,970
Well, don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

513
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:52,931
I didn't know they were looking
for somebody to lead this crazy attack.

514
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,767
I'm surprised
they didn't ask you to do it.

515
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:57,978
Who says they didn't? But I ain't crazy.

516
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:00,647
You're the respectable one, remember?

517
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:11,241
The Emperor's made a critical error,
and the time for our attack has come.

518
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,119
The data brought to us
by the Bothan spies

519
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:18,081
pinpoint the exact location
of the Emperor's new battle station.

520
00:49:18,415 --> 00:49:20,959
We also know that
the weapon systems of this Death Star

521
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,460
are not yet operational.

522
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:25,380
With the Imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy,

523
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,007
in a vain effort to engage us,

524
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,050
it is relatively unprotected.

525
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:32,137
But most important of all,

526
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,390
we've learned that the Emperor himself
is personally overseeing

527
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:38,852
the final stages of the construction
of this Death Star.

528
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:43,648
Many Bothans died to
bring us this information.

529
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,611
Admiral Ackbar, please.

530
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:53,450
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

531
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:58,496
Although the weapon systems on
this Death Star are not yet operational,

532
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:02,667
the Death Star does have
a strong defence mechanism.

533
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:06,129
It is protected by an energy shield

534
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:09,591
which is generated from
the nearby forest moon of Endor.

535
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:19,434
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

536
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:24,731
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter

537
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:27,651
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure

538
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:30,612
and attempt to
knock out the main reactor.

539
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:37,077
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

540
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,203
Good luck.

01:57:06,270 --> 01:57:08,189
(PALPATINE SCREAMING)

1256
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:49,522
I'm going in.

1257
01:57:52,858 --> 01:57:53,985
Here goes nothing.

1258
01:58:01,283 --> 01:58:03,202
Now lock onto
the strongest power source.

1259
01:58:03,285 --> 01:58:05,121
It should be the power generator.

1260
01:58:07,498 --> 01:58:08,874
Form up. Stay alert.

1261
01:58:08,958 --> 01:58:10,626
We could run out of space real fast.

1262
01:58:26,517 --> 01:58:28,436
Split up and head back to the surface.

1263
01:58:28,519 --> 01:58:31,731
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.

1264
01:58:31,814 --> 01:58:32,815
Copy, Gold Leader.

1265
01:58:38,654 --> 01:58:40,322
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)

1266
01:58:43,117 --> 01:58:44,493
That was too close.

1267
01:58:48,664 --> 01:58:50,875
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

1268
01:58:50,958 --> 01:58:54,045
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Star Destroyer.

1269
01:59:00,051 --> 01:59:02,303
Sir, we've lost
our bridge deflector shields.

1270
01:59:02,386 --> 01:59:04,013
Intensify the forward batteries.

1271
01:59:04,096 --> 01:59:05,306
I don't want anything to get through!

1272
01:59:07,933 --> 01:59:09,602
Intensify forward firepower!

1273
01:59:09,810 --> 01:59:11,520
(YELLING)

1274
01:59:11,604 --> 01:59:13,022
Too late!

1275
01:59:22,948 --> 01:59:24,533
(CHEERING)

1276
01:59:56,190 --> 01:59:57,566
Luke.

1277
01:59:57,775 --> 02:00:01,195
Help me take this mask off.

1278
02:00:02,029 --> 02:00:04,406
But you'll die.

1279
02:00:04,615 --> 02:00:08,035
Nothing can stop that now.

1280
02:00:09,203 --> 02:00:10,746
Just for once,

1281
02:00:11,664 --> 02:00:16,919
let me look on you with my own eyes.

1282
02:00:53,164 --> 02:00:54,248
Now,

1283
02:00:54,999 --> 02:00:56,876
go, my son.

1284
02:00:59,378 --> 02:01:00,796
Leave me.

1285
02:01:01,672 --> 02:01:03,549
No. You're coming with me.

1286
02:01:04,633 --> 02:01:06,677
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

1287
02:01:07,595 --> 02:01:11,098
You already have, Luke.

1288
02:01:12,433 --> 02:01:14,101
You were right.

1289
02:01:15,019 --> 02:01:17,521
You were right about me.

1290
02:01:19,356 --> 02:01:21,025
Tell your sister

1291
02:01:22,735 --> 02:01:24,945
you were right.

1292
02:01:31,452 --> 02:01:32,536
Father.

1293
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:38,250
I won't leave you.

1294
02:02:03,776 --> 02:02:04,777
There it is.

1295
02:02:07,655 --> 02:02:10,074
LANDO: All right, Wedge, go for
the power regulator on the north tower.

1296
02:02:10,157 --> 02:02:13,160
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

1297
02:02:32,721 --> 02:02:35,099
Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

1298
02:03:03,127 --> 02:03:04,128

1299
02:03:04,211 --> 02:03:05,337

1301
02:03:23,397 --> 02:03:24,606
C-3PO: They did it!

1302
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:35,534
I'm sure Luke
wasn't on that thing when it blew.

1303
02:03:37,286 --> 02:03:38,495
He wasn't.

1304
02:03:39,496 --> 02:03:41,373
I can feel it.

1305
02:03:45,753 --> 02:03:47,296
You love him.

1306
02:03:50,632 --> 02:03:51,842
Don't you?

1307
02:03:52,551 --> 02:03:53,635
Yes.

1308
02:03:54,136 --> 02:03:56,305
All right. I understand.

1309
02:03:56,889 --> 02:03:57,973
Fine.

1310
02:03:59,266 --> 02:04:00,768
When he comes back,

1311
02:04:02,227 --> 02:04:03,645
I won't get in the way.

1312
02:04:06,565 --> 02:04:08,233
It's not like that at all.

1313
02:04:11,570 --> 02:04:13,405
He's my brother.
