1
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:21,699
<i>- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!</i>

2
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:30,291
<i>I am a servant of the Secret
Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.</i>

3
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:42,266
<i>Go back to the Shadow.</i>

4
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:47,267
<i>The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udfln!</i>

5
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:54,899
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:23,515
No! No!

7
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:28,516
Gandalf!

8
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:35,402
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:39,239
No!

10
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Gandalf!

11
00:03:49,977 --> 00:03:52,813
Gandalf!

12
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:56,983
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:56,984 --> 00:04:01,984
Nothing.

14
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:11,035
Just a dream.

15
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,760
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:28,761
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

17
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:41,486
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:47,492
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:52,493
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:57,794
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:57,795 --> 00:05:02,795
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:07,679
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

23
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,306
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:12,684
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:15,479
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,189
You never know.

27
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,818
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:26,819
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:32,033
It is special.

30
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:37,914
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:41,004
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

32
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:45,342
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:49,846
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:52,724
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:55,268
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:55,269 --> 00:06:00,269
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:11,239
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:27,092
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:30,053
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:33,265
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:38,266
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:42,941
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

43
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:47,070
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

44
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:52,071
but they did.

45
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:06,590
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:09,092
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:14,093
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:27,652
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

49
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:29,905
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:34,906
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:40,119
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:50,342
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

53
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:54,137
but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:59,138
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

55
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:08,481
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:43,395
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:46,064
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:49,401
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:51,403
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:53,780
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:57,742
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

62
00:08:57,743 --> 00:09:02,743
I can smell it.

63
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:08,249
We're not alone.

64
00:09:19,348 --> 00:09:23,601
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:28,231
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:30,567
Where is it?

67
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:33,945
Where is it?

68
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:37,365
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:42,366
My precious.

70
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:45,874
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:50,336
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:47,018
This is Sting.

73
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,686
You've seen it before...

74
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:53,687
haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:55,236 --> 00:11:00,236
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:16,756
It burns!

77
00:11:16,757 --> 00:11:20,552
It burns us!

78
00:11:20,553 --> 00:11:23,805
It freezes!

79
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:26,224
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:31,225
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

81
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:36,734
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:39,612
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

83
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:43,283
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:43,284 --> 00:11:47,662
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:52,083
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:57,084
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:04,008
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

88
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:09,138
Take it off us.

89
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:14,105
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:16,357
We swears.

91
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:21,358
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

92
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:23,448
We swears...

93
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:28,449
to serve the master
of the precious.

94
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,332
We will swear on...

95
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,459
on the precious.

96
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,836
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:41,799
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,718
Yes...

99
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:48,640
on the precious.

100
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:52,185
On the precious.

101
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:55,688
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:59,400
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

103
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:01,277
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,489
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

105
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:20,751
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

106
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:25,969
You've been there before?

107
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,970
Yes.

108
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,440
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:49,702 --> 00:13:53,705
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:58,706
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

111
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:03,131
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:06,759
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

113
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,760
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:15,935
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:20,936
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

116
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:29,028
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:32,660
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:35,038
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,749
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,584
SMEAGOL This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:44,585
Follow me!

122
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:57,852
Merry!

123
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:02,853
Merry!

124
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:08,863
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

125
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:11,532
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:16,533
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:20,416
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:25,417
We will deliver them.

129
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:31,928
Merry!

130
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:36,929
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:15:37,142 --> 00:15:39,435
My friend is sick.

132
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:42,855
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:46,984
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,908
Stop it!

135
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:58,909
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:02,333
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

137
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:05,461
You want some? Huh?

138
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:10,462
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:15,138
Merry.

140
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:18,474
Hello, Pip.

141
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:21,102
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

142
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:24,272
- It was just an act.
- An act?

143
00:16:24,273 --> 00:16:29,273
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:33,865
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:36,868
What is it? What do you smell?

146
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:40,288
Man-flesh.

147
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:43,749
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,586
Aragorn.

149
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:51,587
Let's move!

150
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:15,531
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:17,700
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:22,701
Hurry!

153
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:28,081
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,130
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:34,258
No food. No rest.

156
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:39,259
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:18:09,711 --> 00:18:14,257
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.

158
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:17,468
They may yet be alive.

159
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:22,469
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

160
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:25,351
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

161
00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:30,147
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:35,148
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:18:45,163 --> 00:18:47,081
Rohan.

164
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:51,085
Home of the Horse-lords.

165
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:53,796
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:57,008
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

167
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:02,009
Sets its will against us.

168
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:08,185
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:11,606
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:14,650
They are taking the Hobbits to lsengard.

171
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:19,651
Saruman.

172
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:27,663
<i>The world is changing.</i>

173
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:32,664
<i>Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of lsengard...</i>

174
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:38,382
and Mordor?

175
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:43,383
<i>To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...</i>

176
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:49,181
<i>and the union of the two towers?</i>

177
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:57,485
<i>Together, my Lord Sauron...</i>

178
00:19:57,486 --> 00:20:02,486
<i>we shall rule this Middle-earth.</i>

179
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:21,884
<i>The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.</i>

180
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:26,885
<i>The forests will fall.</i>

181
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:31,018
<i>A new order will rise.</i>

182
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:36,019
<i>We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...</i>

183
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:41,108
<i>and the iron fists of the Orc.</i>

184
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,918
I want them armed
and ready to march within two weeks!

185
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,753
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:57,754 --> 00:21:00,923
We cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

187
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:04,719
Build a darn, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,431
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

189
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:13,432
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

190
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:17,189
- Burn it.
- Yes.

191
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,650
We will fight for you.

192
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:24,651
Swear it.

193
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:37,164
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:40,171
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:44,884
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:47,219
Murderers!

197
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,513
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:21:49,514 --> 00:21:51,599
Burn every village!

199
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:59,519
<i>We have only to
remove those who oppose us.</i>

200
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,486
<i>It will begin in Rohan.</i>

201
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:07,198
<i>Too long have these peasants
stood against you.</i>

202
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:09,200
<i>But no more.</i>

203
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:13,579
Eothain! Eothain!

204
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,624
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

205
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,460
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:22:19,461 --> 00:22:21,295
He is too big for him.

207
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:24,465
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

208
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:27,259
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

209
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,346
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:22:30,347 --> 00:22:34,225
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,980
Quickly!

212
00:22:47,072 --> 00:22:52,072
Go, child.

213
00:23:01,503 --> 00:23:03,921
<i>Rohan, my lord...</i>

214
00:23:03,922 --> 00:23:06,882
<i>is ready to fall.</i>

215
00:23:17,894 --> 00:23:19,645
Théodred.

216
00:23:19,646 --> 00:23:24,646
Find the king's son!

217
00:23:37,706 --> 00:23:42,706
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:49,629
My Lord Eomer, over here!

219
00:23:56,308 --> 00:24:01,308
He's alive.

220
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:33,924
Théodred.

221
00:24:44,356 --> 00:24:47,858
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:51,862
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:55,866
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:24:55,867 --> 00:25:00,537
That is a lie.

225
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:05,538
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

226
00:25:07,045 --> 00:25:10,506
Grima.

227
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:14,969
Grima.

228
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,262
Grima.

229
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:20,724
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

230
00:25:20,725 --> 00:25:25,020
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

231
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:30,021
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,740
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:44,331
Can you not see?

234
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:49,332
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

235
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:54,299
your warmongering.

236
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,427
Warmongering?

237
00:25:56,428 --> 00:25:59,430
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

238
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:02,057
What was the promised price, Grima?

239
00:26:02,058 --> 00:26:07,058
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

240
00:26:18,158 --> 00:26:20,993
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:26:20,994 --> 00:26:25,994
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:35,549
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.

243
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,217
Too much.

244
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:44,016
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

245
00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:49,017
and all its domains
under pain of death.

246
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:51,774
You have no authority here.

247
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:54,777
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:58,781
This order does not come from me.

249
00:26:58,782 --> 00:27:01,533
It comes from the king.

250
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:06,534
He signed it this morning.

251
00:27:35,735 --> 00:27:38,654
Keep breathing. That's the key.

252
00:27:38,655 --> 00:27:43,655
Breathe.

253
00:27:44,536 --> 00:27:49,536
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:28:04,556 --> 00:28:06,682
We're not going no further...

255
00:28:06,683 --> 00:28:09,226
until we've had a breather.

256
00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:14,227
Get a fire going!

257
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:17,192
Merry!

258
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:20,237
Merry!

259
00:28:20,238 --> 00:28:25,238
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:38,672
What's making that noise?

261
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:40,883
It's the trees.

262
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,259
What?

263
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,263
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:28:46,264 --> 00:28:50,934
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

265
00:28:50,935 --> 00:28:52,728
and come alive.

266
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:55,272
Alive?

267
00:28:55,273 --> 00:28:57,983
Trees that could whisper...

268
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,611
talk to each other...

269
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:04,114
<i>"EVER move."</i>

270
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:06,491
I'm starving.

271
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:10,913
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

272
00:29:10,914 --> 00:29:12,414
Yeah!

273
00:29:12,415 --> 00:29:17,415
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:29:18,046 --> 00:29:20,422
What about them?

275
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:22,966
They're fresh.

276
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:27,967
They are not for eating.

277
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:34,853
What about their legs?

278
00:29:34,854 --> 00:29:38,649
They don't need those.

279
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:43,650
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

280
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:48,655
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,789
Alive?

282
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:58,790
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

283
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:04,007
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

284
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:09,008
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:30:09,931 --> 00:30:11,974
- They think we have the Ring.
- Shh.

286
00:30:11,975 --> 00:30:16,270
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

287
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:18,397
Just a mouthful...

288
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:23,398
a bit of the flank.

289
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:30,200
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

290
00:30:36,582 --> 00:30:38,000
Pippin.

291
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:43,001
Let's go.

292
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:49,845
Go on.

293
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:52,723
Call for help.

294
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:54,016
Squeal

295
00:30:54,017 --> 00:30:59,017
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:31:06,404 --> 00:31:11,404
Pippin!

297
00:31:32,055 --> 00:31:35,057
A red sun rises.

298
00:31:35,058 --> 00:31:40,058
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:11,510
Riders of Rohan...

300
00:32:11,511 --> 00:32:16,511
what news from the Mark?

301
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:46,666
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:48,463
Speak quickly!

303
00:32:48,464 --> 00:32:53,464
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,355
I would out off your head, Dwarf...

305
00:33:05,356 --> 00:33:08,692
if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

306
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:13,693
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:33:19,495 --> 00:33:21,705
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:33:21,706 --> 00:33:26,084
This is Gimli, son of Glòin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:31,006
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

310
00:33:31,007 --> 00:33:35,010
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

311
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:40,011
Not even his own kin.

312
00:33:41,726 --> 00:33:43,894
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

313
00:33:43,895 --> 00:33:47,772
and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:33:47,773 --> 00:33:50,942
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:33:50,943 --> 00:33:54,779
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,742
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:33:58,743 --> 00:34:01,328
He walks here and there, they say...

318
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:05,248
as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:34:05,249 --> 00:34:09,211
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

320
00:34:09,212 --> 00:34:11,588
We are no spies.

321
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:14,841
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:34:14,842 --> 00:34:17,969
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

323
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,597
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:34:20,598 --> 00:34:23,934
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:34:23,935 --> 00:34:28,935
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

326
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:32,943
We left none alive.

327
00:34:32,944 --> 00:34:37,944
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:34:41,285 --> 00:34:45,539
Dead?

329
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,540
I am sorry.

330
00:34:52,797 --> 00:34:56,967
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:34:56,968 --> 00:35:01,968
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:35:02,848 --> 00:35:07,848
Farewell.

333
00:35:09,605 --> 00:35:12,315
Look for your friends.

334
00:35:12,316 --> 00:35:16,278
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:19,030
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:24,031
We ride north!

337
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:14,544
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:32,266
We failed them.

339
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:47,410
A Hobbit lay here.

340
00:36:47,411 --> 00:36:52,411
And the other.

341
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,840
They crawled.

342
00:37:05,596 --> 00:37:10,596
Their hands were bound.

343
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,860
Their bonds were cut.

344
00:37:37,128 --> 00:37:42,128
They ran over here.

345
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:47,303
They were followed.

346
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:52,304
The belt!

347
00:37:52,935 --> 00:37:57,772
Run!

348
00:37:57,773 --> 00:38:02,773
Tracks lead away from the battle...

349
00:38:03,988 --> 00:38:06,990
into Fangorn Forest.

350
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:08,658
Fangorn?

351
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:13,659
What madness drove them in there?

352
00:38:28,971 --> 00:38:32,307
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

353
00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:43,689
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

354
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:53,282
Come here!

355
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:59,830
Trees. Climb a tree.

356
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:09,135
He's gone.

357
00:39:20,564 --> 00:39:24,317
Merry!

358
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:39,370
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

359
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:50,881
Run, Merry!

360
00:39:57,268 --> 00:40:01,771
Little Orcs.
Bu-rha-rhoom.

361
00:40:01,772 --> 00:40:04,274
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

362
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:06,276
Tree?

363
00:40:06,277 --> 00:40:09,487
I am no tree!

364
00:40:09,488 --> 00:40:12,282
I am an Ent.

365
00:40:12,283 --> 00:40:14,909
A tree-herder.

366
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,078
A shepherd of the forest.

367
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,913
Don't talk to it, Merry.

368
00:40:18,914 --> 00:40:20,582
Don't encourage it!

369
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:25,003
Treebeard, some call me.

370
00:40:25,004 --> 00:40:27,589
And whose side are you on?

371
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,424
Side?

372
00:40:29,425 --> 00:40:32,635
I am on nobody's side...

373
00:40:32,636 --> 00:40:37,636
because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

374
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:43,809
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

375
00:40:43,814 --> 00:40:46,357
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

376
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:49,903
Hobbits?

377
00:40:49,904 --> 00:40:54,904
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

378
00:40:55,951 --> 00:40:59,412
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

379
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:03,041
They come with fire.

380
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:05,835
They come with axes.

381
00:41:05,836 --> 00:41:10,836
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

382
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:14,844
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

383
00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:17,847
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

384
00:41:17,848 --> 00:41:19,849
Halflings!

385
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,142
Shire-folk!

386
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:23,770
Maybe you are...

387
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:28,483
and maybe you aren't.

388
00:41:28,484 --> 00:41:33,196
The White Wizard will know.

389
00:41:33,197 --> 00:41:36,658
The White Wizard?

390
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:41,659
Saruman.

391
00:41:50,714 --> 00:41:52,632
See? See?

392
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:55,176
We've led you out.

393
00:41:55,177 --> 00:42:00,177
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

394
00:42:00,808 --> 00:42:05,808
Very lucky we find you.

395
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:13,403
Nice Hobbit.

396
00:42:13,404 --> 00:42:18,074
Oh! It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

397
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:21,452
A swamp, yes, yes-

398
00:42:21,453 --> 00:42:26,453
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

399
00:42:28,502 --> 00:42:33,502
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

400
00:42:35,217 --> 00:42:38,052
I found it. I did.

401
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:40,930
The way through the marshes.

402
00:42:40,931 --> 00:42:44,600
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

403
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:48,938
They go around for miles and miles.

404
00:42:48,939 --> 00:42:50,523
Come quickly.

405
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:55,524
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

406
00:42:55,738 --> 00:42:59,240
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

407
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:01,659
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

408
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,329
No, no birdses to eat.

409
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:10,168
No crunch able birdses.

410
00:43:10,169 --> 00:43:13,212
And we are famished! Yes!

411
00:43:13,213 --> 00:43:18,213
Famished we are, precious!

412
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:35,151
Here.

413
00:43:35,152 --> 00:43:37,361
What does it eats?

414
00:43:37,362 --> 00:43:41,824
Is it tasty?

415
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,497
It tries to chokes us!

416
00:43:47,498 --> 00:43:52,498
We can't eats Hobbit food!

417
00:43:52,878 --> 00:43:57,090
We must starve!

418
00:43:57,091 --> 00:44:00,218
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

419
00:44:00,219 --> 00:44:02,637
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

420
00:44:02,638 --> 00:44:05,723
It does not care if we be hungry.

421
00:44:05,724 --> 00:44:10,724
Does not care if we should die.

422
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:15,316
Not like master.

423
00:44:15,317 --> 00:44:18,569
Master cares.

424
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,907
Master knows.

425
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:25,034
Yes.

426
00:44:25,035 --> 00:44:30,035
Precious.

427
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:36,250
Once it takes hold of us...

428
00:44:36,713 --> 00:44:41,592
it never lets go.

429
00:44:41,593 --> 00:44:46,593
Don't touch me!

430
00:45:15,252 --> 00:45:17,295
There are dead things!

431
00:45:17,296 --> 00:45:22,296
Dead faces in the water.

432
00:45:23,886 --> 00:45:28,389
All dead. All rotten.

433
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:32,351
Elves and Men and Orcses.

434
00:45:32,352 --> 00:45:36,772
A great battle long ago.

435
00:45:36,773 --> 00:45:38,733
Dead Marshes.

436
00:45:38,734 --> 00:45:43,112
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

437
00:45:43,113 --> 00:45:45,114
This way.

438
00:45:45,115 --> 00:45:49,619
Don't follow the lights.

439
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,623
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

440
00:45:53,624 --> 00:45:58,624
and light little candles
of their own.

441
00:46:23,946 --> 00:46:28,946
Frodo!

442
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:14,787
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

443
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:16,831
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

444
00:47:16,832 --> 00:47:21,832
Are you all right?

445
00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:50,740
So bright.

446
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:54,744
So beautiful.

447
00:47:54,745 --> 00:47:59,745
Our precious.

448
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,751
What did you say?

449
00:48:01,752 --> 00:48:04,086
Master should be resting.

450
00:48:04,087 --> 00:48:09,087
Master needs to keep up his strength.

451
00:48:10,135 --> 00:48:13,554
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

452
00:48:13,555 --> 00:48:15,222
Gollum. Gollum.

453
00:48:15,223 --> 00:48:17,266
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

454
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:21,479
<i>Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home</i>

455
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,272
He said your life was a sad story.

456
00:48:23,273 --> 00:48:27,943
<i>They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead</i>

457
00:48:27,944 --> 00:48:31,113
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

458
00:48:31,114 --> 00:48:35,076
Were you?

459
00:48:35,077 --> 00:48:40,077
Sméagol.

460
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:45,920
What did you call me?

461
00:48:45,921 --> 00:48:49,298
That was your name once, wasn't it?

462
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:52,426
A long time ago.

463
00:48:52,427 --> 00:48:55,679
My name.

464
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,680
My name.

465
00:49:04,106 --> 00:49:07,233
Sméagol.

466
00:49:10,695 --> 00:49:12,488
Black Riders!

467
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:13,989
Hide! Hide!

468
00:49:24,418 --> 00:49:26,877
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

469
00:49:26,878 --> 00:49:31,340
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

470
00:49:31,341 --> 00:49:34,135
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

471
00:49:34,136 --> 00:49:39,136
No, you cannot kill them. No.

472
00:50:04,207 --> 00:50:05,499
SMEAGOL Wraiths!

473
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:10,500
Wraiths on wings!

474
00:50:15,677 --> 00:50:17,970
They are calling for it.

475
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:22,971
They are calling for the precious.

476
00:50:23,643 --> 00:50:25,936
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

477
00:50:25,937 --> 00:50:30,937
I'm here.

478
00:50:43,205 --> 00:50:45,289
SMEAGOL Hurry, Hobbits.

479
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:50,290
The Black Gate is very close.

480
00:50:56,092 --> 00:51:01,092
Orc blood.

481
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:11,023
These are strange tracks.

482
00:51:11,024 --> 00:51:14,193
The air is so close in here.

483
00:51:14,194 --> 00:51:17,446
This forest is old.

484
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:21,158
Very old.

485
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:26,080
Full of memory...

486
00:51:26,081 --> 00:51:28,999
and anger.

487
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:37,633
The trees are speaking to each other.

488
00:51:37,634 --> 00:51:39,301
Gimli!

489
00:51:39,302 --> 00:51:44,056
Lower your axe.

490
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:47,351
They have feelings, my friend.

491
00:51:47,352 --> 00:51:49,520
The Elves began it.

492
00:51:49,521 --> 00:51:54,521
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

493
00:51:54,776 --> 00:51:57,778
Talking trees.

494
00:51:57,779 --> 00:52:00,990
What do trees have to talk about?

495
00:52:00,991 --> 00:52:05,991
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

496
00:52:07,789 --> 00:52:12,789
Something's out there.

497
00:52:15,797 --> 00:52:18,132
What do you see?

498
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:23,133
The White Wizard approaches.

499
00:52:26,766 --> 00:52:31,766
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

500
00:52:40,655 --> 00:52:45,655
We must be quick.

501
00:52:58,465 --> 00:53:02,718
You are tracking
the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

502
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:04,303
Where are they?

503
00:53:04,304 --> 00:53:08,057
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

504
00:53:08,058 --> 00:53:12,478
They met someone they did not expect.

505
00:53:12,479 --> 00:53:14,772
Does that comfort you?

506
00:53:14,773 --> 00:53:18,192
Who are you?

507
00:53:18,193 --> 00:53:23,193
Show yourself!

508
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:33,999
It cannot be.

509
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,669
Forgive me.

510
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,380
I mistook you for Saruman.

511
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:43,676
I am Saruman.

512
00:53:43,677 --> 00:53:48,514
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

513
00:53:48,515 --> 00:53:51,475
You fell.

514
00:53:51,476 --> 00:53:54,186
Through fire...

515
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:56,939
and water.

516
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,650
<i>From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...</i>

517
00:53:59,651 --> 00:54:04,154
I <i>fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.</i>

518
00:54:19,254 --> 00:54:22,131
<i>Until at last
I threw down my enemy...</i>

519
00:54:22,132 --> 00:54:27,132
<i>and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.</i>

520
00:54:32,642 --> 00:54:35,936
<i>Darkness took me...</i>

521
00:54:35,937 --> 00:54:40,774
and <i>I strayed out of thought
and time.</i>

522
00:54:40,775 --> 00:54:44,153
<i>Stars wheeled overhead...</i>

523
00:54:44,154 --> 00:54:49,154
and <i>every day was as long
as</i> a <i>life age of the Earth.</i>

524
00:54:50,744 --> 00:54:53,162
<i>But it was not the end.</i>

525
00:54:53,163 --> 00:54:57,875
<i>I felt life in me again.</i>

526
00:54:57,876 --> 00:55:00,586
<i>I've been sent back...</i>

527
00:55:00,587 --> 00:55:02,588
until my task is done.

528
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:05,174
Gandalf.

529
00:55:05,175 --> 00:55:07,551
Gandalf?

530
00:55:07,552 --> 00:55:12,181
Yes.

531
00:55:12,182 --> 00:55:16,810
That was what they used to call me.

532
00:55:16,811 --> 00:55:20,397
Gandalf the Grey.

533
00:55:20,398 --> 00:55:22,399
That was my name.

534
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,736
Gandalf.

535
00:55:25,737 --> 00:55:30,737
I am Gandalf the White.

536
00:55:30,825 --> 00:55:34,077
And I come back to you now...

537
00:55:34,078 --> 00:55:37,706
at the turn of the tide.

538
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:41,418
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

539
00:55:41,419 --> 00:55:45,506
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

540
00:55:45,507 --> 00:55:47,800
That is no short distance!

541
00:55:47,801 --> 00:55:51,220
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

542
00:55:51,221 --> 00:55:53,472
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

543
00:55:53,473 --> 00:55:57,059
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

544
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,228
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

545
00:55:59,229 --> 00:56:03,315
in this horrid, dark, dank,
tree-infested...?

546
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:09,404
I mean, charming...

547
00:56:09,405 --> 00:56:12,741
quite charming forest.

548
00:56:12,742 --> 00:56:16,537
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

549
00:56:16,538 --> 00:56:21,041
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

550
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:24,670
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

551
00:56:24,671 --> 00:56:28,173
that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

552
00:56:28,174 --> 00:56:30,509
In one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

553
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:35,510
- Hm?
- You still speak in riddles.

554
00:56:37,767 --> 00:56:42,767
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

555
00:56:44,357 --> 00:56:48,527
The Ents are going to wake up...

556
00:56:48,528 --> 00:56:53,528
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

557
00:56:53,783 --> 00:56:55,117
Oh, that's good.

558
00:56:55,118 --> 00:56:58,912
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

559
00:56:58,913 --> 00:57:01,331
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

560
00:57:01,332 --> 00:57:05,168
In fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

561
00:57:05,169 --> 00:57:09,172
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

562
00:57:31,154 --> 00:57:32,821
That is one of the Mearas...

563
00:57:32,822 --> 00:57:37,822
unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

564
00:57:53,176 --> 00:57:58,055
Shadowfax.

565
00:57:58,056 --> 00:58:02,267
He is the lord of all horses...

566
00:58:02,268 --> 00:58:07,268
and has been my friend
through many dangers.

567
00:58:20,453 --> 00:58:24,206
<i>O rowan mine</i>

568
00:58:24,207 --> 00:58:28,168
<i>I saw you shine</i>

569
00:58:28,169 --> 00:58:32,798
<i>Upon a summer's day</i>

570
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:37,469
<i>Upon your head How golden-red</i>

571
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:42,391
<i>The crown you bore aloft</i>

572
00:58:42,392 --> 00:58:44,935
Such a beautiful verse.

573
00:58:44,936 --> 00:58:49,936
- Is it much further?
- Bru-Ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

574
00:58:50,024 --> 00:58:54,194
You might call it far, perhaps.

575
00:58:54,195 --> 00:58:58,198
My home lies deep in the forest...

576
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:03,199
near the roots of the mountain.

577
00:59:03,413 --> 00:59:07,290
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

578
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:11,545
And safe is where I'll keep you.

579
00:59:11,546 --> 00:59:16,299
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

580
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,469
It's one of my own compositions.

581
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:20,846
Right. Ahem.

582
00:59:20,847 --> 00:59:25,847
<i>Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves</i>

583
00:59:27,145 --> 00:59:32,145
<i>And the dreams of trees unfold</i>

584
00:59:32,191 --> 00:59:37,191
<i>When woodland halls are green and cool</i>

585
00:59:38,823 --> 00:59:43,368
<i>And the wind is in the West</i>

586
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:46,580
<i>Come back to me</i>

587
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:51,209
<i>Come back to me</i>

588
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:56,210
<i>And say my land is best</i>

589
00:59:59,135 --> 01:00:04,135
Oh.

590
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:08,977
Sleep, little Shirelings.

591
01:00:08,978 --> 01:00:12,689
Heed no nightly noise.

592
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:17,690
Sleep till morning light.

593
01:00:18,237 --> 01:00:22,574
I have business in the forest.

594
01:00:22,575 --> 01:00:27,575
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

595
01:00:29,332 --> 01:00:34,169
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

596
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:39,170
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

597
01:00:49,435 --> 01:00:54,435
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

598
01:00:54,524 --> 01:00:57,526
Sauron will suffer no rival.

599
01:00:57,527 --> 01:01:02,030
From the summit of Barad-dur,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

600
01:01:02,031 --> 01:01:06,451
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

601
01:01:06,452 --> 01:01:08,578
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

602
01:01:08,579 --> 01:01:11,331
The rumor has reached him.

603
01:01:11,332 --> 01:01:15,252
The heir of Numenor still lives.

604
01:01:15,253 --> 01:01:19,381
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

605
01:01:19,382 --> 01:01:22,843
He fears what you may become.

606
01:01:22,844 --> 01:01:26,429
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

607
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:30,225
He will use his puppet, Saruman,
to destroy Rohan.

608
01:01:30,226 --> 01:01:31,893
War is coming.

609
01:01:31,894 --> 01:01:35,647
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

610
01:01:35,648 --> 01:01:38,233
for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

611
01:01:38,234 --> 01:01:42,112
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

612
01:01:42,113 --> 01:01:45,365
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

613
01:01:45,366 --> 01:01:50,366
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

614
01:01:50,872 --> 01:01:53,206
But for all their cunning...

615
01:01:53,207 --> 01:01:57,919
we have one advantage.

616
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,590
The Ring remains hidden.

617
01:02:01,591 --> 01:02:03,675
And that we should seek to destroy it...

618
01:02:03,676 --> 01:02:07,220
has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

619
01:02:07,221 --> 01:02:10,724
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

620
01:02:10,725 --> 01:02:12,392
in the hands of a Hobbit.

621
01:02:12,393 --> 01:02:16,646
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

622
01:02:16,647 --> 01:02:19,441
We must trust now in Frodo.

623
01:02:19,442 --> 01:02:21,443
Everything depends upon speed...

624
01:02:21,444 --> 01:02:26,406
and the secrecy of his quest.

625
01:02:26,407 --> 01:02:30,619
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

626
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:34,122
Frodo must finish this task alone.

627
01:02:34,123 --> 01:02:36,625
He's not alone.

628
01:02:36,626 --> 01:02:38,960
Sam went with him.

629
01:02:38,961 --> 01:02:40,337
Did he?

630
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:45,338
Did he, indeed? Good.

631
01:02:45,635 --> 01:02:50,635
Yes, very good.

632
01:02:56,020 --> 01:03:01,020
SMEAGOL
The Black Gate of Mordor.

633
01:03:03,694 --> 01:03:08,694
Oh, save us.

634
01:03:11,953 --> 01:03:16,953
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

635
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:22,087
Master says to
show him the way into Mordor.

636
01:03:22,088 --> 01:03:25,674
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

637
01:03:25,675 --> 01:03:30,675
I did.

638
01:03:35,685 --> 01:03:39,229
That's it, then.

639
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:41,064
We can't get past that.

640
01:04:25,735 --> 01:04:27,235
Look!

641
01:04:27,236 --> 01:04:28,862
The gate.

642
01:04:28,863 --> 01:04:33,863
It's opening!

643
01:04:37,496 --> 01:04:40,248
I can see a way down.

644
01:04:40,249 --> 01:04:44,502
Sam, no!

645
01:04:44,503 --> 01:04:49,503
Master!

646
01:06:09,713 --> 01:06:14,008
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

647
01:06:14,009 --> 01:06:17,595
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

648
01:06:17,596 --> 01:06:20,014
- Now!
- No!

649
01:06:20,015 --> 01:06:22,183
No! No, master!

650
01:06:22,184 --> 01:06:26,479
They catch you! They catch you!

651
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:31,480
Don't take it to him.

652
01:06:31,986 --> 01:06:34,863
He wants the precious.

653
01:06:34,864 --> 01:06:38,074
Always he is looking for it.

654
01:06:38,075 --> 01:06:42,203
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

655
01:06:42,204 --> 01:06:47,204
But we mustn't let him have it.

656
01:06:52,506 --> 01:06:54,799
No! There's another way.

657
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,760
More secret. A dark way.

658
01:06:57,761 --> 01:07:01,890
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

659
01:07:01,891 --> 01:07:03,600
He's up to something.

660
01:07:03,601 --> 01:07:06,394
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

661
01:07:06,395 --> 01:07:09,272
Yes. There's a path...

662
01:07:09,273 --> 01:07:11,983
and some stairs.

663
01:07:11,984 --> 01:07:13,818
And then...

664
01:07:13,819 --> 01:07:17,530
a tunnel.

665
01:07:31,128 --> 01:07:33,087
He's led us this far, Sam.

666
01:07:33,088 --> 01:07:35,632
Mr. Frodo, no.

667
01:07:35,633 --> 01:07:40,633
He's been true to his word.

668
01:07:41,972 --> 01:07:45,308
No.

669
01:07:45,309 --> 01:07:47,560
Lead the way, Sméagol.

670
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:52,561
Good Sméagol always helps.

671
01:08:25,474 --> 01:08:28,893
Hello?

672
01:08:28,894 --> 01:08:31,604
Treebeard?

673
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:33,147
Where has he gone?

674
01:08:33,148 --> 01:08:36,234
I had the loveliest dream last night.

675
01:08:36,235 --> 01:08:39,112
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

676
01:08:39,113 --> 01:08:42,115
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

677
01:08:42,116 --> 01:08:45,618
you were sick.

678
01:08:45,619 --> 01:08:49,581
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

679
01:08:52,001 --> 01:08:57,001
Did you hear that?

680
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:03,344
There it is again.

681
01:09:03,345 --> 01:09:07,098
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

682
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:14,856
You just said something... Treeish.

683
01:09:14,857 --> 01:09:19,857
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

684
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:28,828
You're taller.

685
01:09:28,829 --> 01:09:30,538
'Who?
'You!

686
01:09:30,539 --> 01:09:32,624
- Than what?
- Than me!

687
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:34,917
I've always been taller than you.

688
01:09:34,918 --> 01:09:39,918
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

689
01:09:40,382 --> 01:09:42,091
Please, Merry.

690
01:09:42,092 --> 01:09:46,554
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

691
01:09:46,555 --> 01:09:48,848
"Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7"

692
01:09:51,477 --> 01:09:55,688
3'8"!

693
01:09:55,689 --> 01:10:00,568
Three-foot-eight.

694
01:10:00,569 --> 01:10:05,569
You did something.

695
01:10:08,285 --> 01:10:10,787
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

696
01:10:10,788 --> 01:10:12,455
Merry!

697
01:10:12,456 --> 01:10:14,957
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

698
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:19,087
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

699
01:10:19,088 --> 01:10:23,091
Give me it back. Merry!

700
01:10:23,092 --> 01:10:25,259
What's happening?!

701
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,095
It's got my leg!

702
01:10:27,096 --> 01:10:31,391
Merry!

703
01:10:37,106 --> 01:10:42,106
No!

704
01:10:47,908 --> 01:10:52,908
Help!

705
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:58,334
Away with you.

706
01:10:58,335 --> 01:11:00,628
You should not be waking.

707
01:11:00,629 --> 01:11:05,629
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

708
01:11:06,176 --> 01:11:09,137
Go to sleep.

709
01:11:09,138 --> 01:11:11,139
Away with you.

710
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:14,976
Come, the forest is waking up.

711
01:11:14,977 --> 01:11:19,564
It isn't safe.

712
01:11:19,565 --> 01:11:23,651
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

713
01:11:23,652 --> 01:11:27,530
Anger festers in their hearts.

714
01:11:27,531 --> 01:11:29,323
Black are their thoughts.

715
01:11:29,324 --> 01:11:32,034
Strong is their hate.

716
01:11:32,035 --> 01:11:34,954
They will harm you if they can.

717
01:11:34,955 --> 01:11:38,708
There are too few of us now.

718
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:43,337
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

719
01:11:43,338 --> 01:11:46,174
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

720
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:49,510
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-Ra-hroom.

721
01:11:49,511 --> 01:11:54,511
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

722
01:11:55,309 --> 01:12:00,309
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

723
01:12:00,814 --> 01:12:02,398
Oh, I'm sorry.

724
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:06,486
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

725
01:12:06,487 --> 01:12:09,906
We lost them.

726
01:12:09,907 --> 01:12:14,907
And now we cannot find them.

727
01:12:15,204 --> 01:12:20,204
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

728
01:12:21,543 --> 01:12:24,629
Can't say that I have.

729
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:28,132
You, Pip?

730
01:12:28,133 --> 01:12:32,970
What do they look like?

731
01:12:32,971 --> 01:12:37,971
I don't remember now.

732
01:12:54,034 --> 01:12:58,746
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

733
01:12:58,747 --> 01:13:02,041
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

734
01:13:02,042 --> 01:13:05,127
<i>whose mind is overthrown.</i>

735
01:13:05,128 --> 01:13:10,049
<i>Saruman's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.</i>

736
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:13,386
My lord, your son...

737
01:13:13,387 --> 01:13:17,056
he is dead.

738
01:13:17,057 --> 01:13:20,142
My lord?

739
01:13:20,143 --> 01:13:25,143
Uncle?

740
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:33,110
Will you not go to him?

741
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:36,075
Will you do nothing?

742
01:13:36,076 --> 01:13:38,286
Be careful what you say.

743
01:13:38,287 --> 01:13:43,287
Do not look for welcome here.

744
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:08,816
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

745
01:14:08,817 --> 01:14:11,193
What a tragedy for the king...

746
01:14:11,194 --> 01:14:15,323
to lose his only son and heir.

747
01:14:15,324 --> 01:14:19,952
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

748
01:14:19,953 --> 01:14:24,953
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

749
01:14:25,042 --> 01:14:27,960
Leave me alone, snake!

750
01:14:27,961 --> 01:14:31,255
Oh, but you are alone.

751
01:14:31,256 --> 01:14:36,177
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

752
01:14:36,178 --> 01:14:39,847
in the bitter watches of the night...

753
01:14:39,848 --> 01:14:43,643
when all your life seems to shrink.

754
01:14:43,644 --> 01:14:48,022
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

755
01:14:48,023 --> 01:14:53,023
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

756
01:14:54,863 --> 01:14:57,990
So fair.

757
01:14:57,991 --> 01:15:01,160
So cold.

758
01:15:01,161 --> 01:15:03,579
Like a morning of pale spring...

759
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:08,580
still clinging to winter's chill.

760
01:15:20,764 --> 01:15:25,764
Your words are poison.

761
01:16:55,776 --> 01:17:00,776
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

762
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,708
Ah.

763
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:17,709
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

764
01:17:18,006 --> 01:17:23,006
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

765
01:17:37,859 --> 01:17:42,859
- Your staff.
- Hm? Oh...

766
01:17:43,031 --> 01:17:48,031
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

767
01:18:05,345 --> 01:18:10,345
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

768
01:18:16,565 --> 01:18:18,315
He's a herald of woe.

769
01:18:18,316 --> 01:18:23,316
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

770
01:18:23,822 --> 01:18:25,948
Théoden King.

771
01:18:25,949 --> 01:18:29,410
He's not welcome.

772
01:18:29,411 --> 01:18:34,411
Why should I welcome you...

773
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:39,086
Gandalf Stormcrow?

774
01:18:39,087 --> 01:18:42,590
A just question, my liege.

775
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:45,593
Late is the hour...

776
01:18:45,594 --> 01:18:50,347
in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

777
01:18:50,348 --> 01:18:52,600
Léthspell I name him.

778
01:18:52,601 --> 01:18:55,644
I'll news is an ill guest.

779
01:18:55,645 --> 01:19:00,399
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

780
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,484
I have not passed
through fire and death...

781
01:19:02,485 --> 01:19:06,697
to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

782
01:19:06,698 --> 01:19:08,991
His staff.

783
01:19:08,992 --> 01:19:13,992
I told you to take the Wizard's staff.

784
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:18,959
Théoden...

785
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:23,297
son of Thengel...

786
01:19:23,298 --> 01:19:28,298
too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

787
01:19:28,637 --> 01:19:32,139
I would stay still if I were you.

788
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:37,140
Hearken to me!

789
01:19:39,648 --> 01:19:41,982
I release you...

790
01:19:41,983 --> 01:19:44,568
from the spell.

791
01:19:55,497 --> 01:19:58,791
You have no power here...

792
01:19:58,792 --> 01:20:03,792
Gandalf the Grey.

793
01:20:07,759 --> 01:20:12,759
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

794
01:20:22,232 --> 01:20:25,192
Wait.

795
01:20:25,193 --> 01:20:29,738
If I go, Théoden dies.

796
01:20:29,739 --> 01:20:32,116
You did not kill me...

797
01:20:32,117 --> 01:20:37,117
you will not kill him.

798
01:20:38,206 --> 01:20:41,417
Rohan is mine.

799
01:20:41,418 --> 01:20:46,418
Be gone.

800
01:21:27,255 --> 01:21:32,255
I know your face.

801
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:37,556
Eowyn.

802
01:21:37,557 --> 01:21:42,557
Eowyn.

803
01:21:47,108 --> 01:21:48,817
Gandalf?

804
01:21:48,818 --> 01:21:53,818
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

805
01:22:05,085 --> 01:22:10,085
Dark have been my dreams of late.

806
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:15,803
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

807
01:22:15,804 --> 01:22:20,804
if they grasped your sword.

808
01:23:03,852 --> 01:23:06,019
I've only...

809
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:09,231
ever served you, my lord.

810
01:23:09,232 --> 01:23:14,232
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

811
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:19,491
Send me not from your sight.

812
01:23:19,492 --> 01:23:22,411
No, my lord! No, my lord.

813
01:23:22,412 --> 01:23:24,371
Let him go.

814
01:23:24,372 --> 01:23:29,372
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

815
01:23:36,676 --> 01:23:41,221
Get out of my way!

816
01:23:41,222 --> 01:23:46,222
Hail, Théoden King!

817
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:14,042
Where is Théodred?

818
01:24:14,589 --> 01:24:19,589
Where is my son?

819
01:25:44,345 --> 01:25:49,345
Simbelmyné.

820
01:25:51,185 --> 01:25:56,185
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

821
01:25:58,651 --> 01:26:03,651
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

822
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:08,368
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

823
01:26:08,369 --> 01:26:13,369
The young perish and the old linger.

824
01:26:13,374 --> 01:26:15,667
That I should live...

825
01:26:15,668 --> 01:26:20,255
to see the last days of my house.

826
01:26:20,256 --> 01:26:25,256
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

827
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:32,180
No parent should have to bury
their child.

828
01:26:47,283 --> 01:26:50,243
He was strong in life.

829
01:26:50,244 --> 01:26:55,244
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

830
01:27:38,418 --> 01:27:40,460
They had no warning.

831
01:27:40,461 --> 01:27:43,338
They were unarmed.

832
01:27:43,339 --> 01:27:48,301
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

833
01:27:48,302 --> 01:27:50,637
Rick, cot and tree.

834
01:27:50,638 --> 01:27:53,640
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.

835
01:27:53,641 --> 01:27:57,978
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

836
01:27:57,979 --> 01:28:02,979
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

837
01:28:03,985 --> 01:28:07,738
Ride out and meet him head on.

838
01:28:07,739 --> 01:28:11,575
Draw him away from your women
and children.

839
01:28:11,576 --> 01:28:13,368
You must fight.

840
01:28:13,369 --> 01:28:17,372
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

841
01:28:17,373 --> 01:28:19,166
Eomer is loyal to you.

842
01:28:19,167 --> 01:28:22,043
His men will return
and fight for their king.

843
01:28:22,044 --> 01:28:27,044
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

844
01:28:29,677 --> 01:28:32,471
Eomer cannot help us.

845
01:28:32,472 --> 01:28:34,431
I know what it is you want of me...

846
01:28:34,432 --> 01:28:39,352
but I will not bring further death
to my people.

847
01:28:39,353 --> 01:28:43,273
I will not risk open war.

848
01:28:43,274 --> 01:28:48,274
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

849
01:28:50,907 --> 01:28:52,991
When last I looked...

850
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:57,992
Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

851
01:29:03,503 --> 01:29:08,503
Then what is the king's decision?

852
01:29:11,344 --> 01:29:12,886
<i>By order of the king...</i>

853
01:29:12,887 --> 01:29:15,472
the city must empty.

854
01:29:15,473 --> 01:29:18,642
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

855
01:29:18,643 --> 01:29:22,729
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

856
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:24,397
Helm's Deep.

857
01:29:24,398 --> 01:29:28,109
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

858
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,237
Who will defend them if not their king?

859
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:32,864
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

860
01:29:32,865 --> 01:29:34,866
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

861
01:29:34,867 --> 01:29:38,912
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

862
01:29:38,913 --> 01:29:41,289
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

863
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:45,001
What they will get is a massacre.

864
01:29:45,002 --> 01:29:48,380
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

865
01:29:48,381 --> 01:29:52,175
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

866
01:29:52,176 --> 01:29:55,512
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

867
01:29:55,513 --> 01:29:58,682
The people of Rohan will need you.

868
01:29:58,683 --> 01:30:02,561
The defenses have to hold.

869
01:30:02,562 --> 01:30:07,562
They Will hold.

870
01:30:08,317 --> 01:30:10,777
The Grey Pilgrim.

871
01:30:10,778 --> 01:30:13,572
That's what they used to call me.

872
01:30:13,573 --> 01:30:18,573
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

873
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:23,039
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

874
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:27,210
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

875
01:30:27,211 --> 01:30:30,088
At dawn, look to the east.

876
01:30:30,089 --> 01:30:35,089
Go.

877
01:30:58,951 --> 01:31:03,747
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

878
01:31:41,369 --> 01:31:44,913
His name is Brego.

879
01:31:44,914 --> 01:31:47,040
He was my cousin's horse.

880
01:31:47,041 --> 01:31:50,377
Brego.

881
01:31:50,378 --> 01:31:53,588
Your name is kingly.

882
01:32:03,599 --> 01:32:06,184
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

883
01:32:06,185 --> 01:32:10,522
but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

884
01:32:10,523 --> 01:32:14,734
You speak as one of their own.

885
01:32:14,735 --> 01:32:17,445
I was raised in Rivendell...

886
01:32:17,446 --> 01:32:22,283
for a time.

887
01:32:22,284 --> 01:32:24,953
Turn this fellow free.

888
01:32:24,954 --> 01:32:29,954
He's seen enough of war.

889
01:32:39,218 --> 01:32:42,220
Gandalf the White.

890
01:32:42,221 --> 01:32:45,932
Gandalf the Fool!

891
01:32:45,933 --> 01:32:50,933
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

892
01:32:51,147 --> 01:32:55,525
There were three
who followed the wizard.

893
01:32:55,526 --> 01:33:00,526
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

894
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:06,240
You stink of horse.

895
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:13,209
The Man...

896
01:33:13,210 --> 01:33:17,589
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

897
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:21,551
One of the Dunedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

898
01:33:21,552 --> 01:33:24,262
His cloth was poor.

899
01:33:24,263 --> 01:33:29,263
And yet he bore a strange ring.

900
01:33:30,478 --> 01:33:34,189
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

901
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:39,190
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

902
01:33:40,196 --> 01:33:43,073
The Ring of Barahir.

903
01:33:43,074 --> 01:33:46,826
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found lsildur's heir.

904
01:33:46,827 --> 01:33:50,330
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

905
01:33:50,331 --> 01:33:54,501
The line was broken years ago.

906
01:33:54,502 --> 01:33:56,127
It matters not.

907
01:33:56,128 --> 01:33:58,838
The world of Men shall fall.

908
01:33:58,839 --> 01:34:03,839
It will begin at Edoras.

909
01:34:09,934 --> 01:34:12,018
I am ready, Gamling.

910
01:34:12,019 --> 01:34:17,019
Bring my horse.

911
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:21,444
This is not a defeat.

912
01:34:21,445 --> 01:34:26,445
We will return.

913
01:34:28,119 --> 01:34:33,119
We will return.

914
01:34:53,894 --> 01:34:58,894
You have some skill with a blade.

915
01:35:04,363 --> 01:35:06,614
Women of this country learned long ago:

916
01:35:06,615 --> 01:35:09,409
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

917
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:12,495
I fear neither death nor pain.

918
01:35:12,496 --> 01:35:17,496
What do you fear, my lady?

919
01:35:18,002 --> 01:35:21,129
A cage.

920
01:35:21,130 --> 01:35:25,133
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

921
01:35:25,134 --> 01:35:30,134
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

922
01:35:32,474 --> 01:35:35,768
You're a daughter of kings...

923
01:35:35,769 --> 01:35:40,769
a shield maiden of Rohan.

924
01:35:44,361 --> 01:35:49,361
I do not think that would be your fate.

925
01:36:19,939 --> 01:36:23,149
Théoden <i>will</i> not <i>stay at</i> Edoras.

926
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:25,443
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

927
01:36:25,444 --> 01:36:29,656
He will expect an attack on the city.

928
01:36:29,657 --> 01:36:33,076
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

929
01:36:33,077 --> 01:36:36,663
the great fortress of Rohan.

930
01:36:36,664 --> 01:36:41,664
<i>It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.</i>

931
01:36:42,461 --> 01:36:44,545
<i>They will be slow.</i>

932
01:36:44,546 --> 01:36:49,546
They will have women and children
with them.

933
01:36:52,846 --> 01:36:55,682
Send out your Warg-riders.

934
01:37:09,989 --> 01:37:13,074
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

935
01:37:13,075 --> 01:37:15,910
- Why do you do that?
- What?

936
01:37:15,911 --> 01:37:18,871
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

937
01:37:18,872 --> 01:37:22,458
Because.

938
01:37:22,459 --> 01:37:24,752
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

939
01:37:24,753 --> 01:37:27,380
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

940
01:37:27,381 --> 01:37:30,341
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

941
01:37:30,342 --> 01:37:32,760
You have no idea what it did to him...

942
01:37:32,761 --> 01:37:37,473
what it's still doing to him.

943
01:37:37,474 --> 01:37:39,726
I want to help him, Sam.

944
01:37:39,727 --> 01:37:44,727
Why?

945
01:37:46,317 --> 01:37:51,317
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

946
01:37:53,741 --> 01:37:55,783
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

947
01:37:55,784 --> 01:38:00,784
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

948
01:38:05,461 --> 01:38:10,461
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

949
01:38:10,507 --> 01:38:13,676
I do.

950
01:38:13,677 --> 01:38:16,095
It's the Ring.

951
01:38:16,096 --> 01:38:18,389
You can't take your eyes off it.

952
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:20,850
I've seen you.

953
01:38:20,851 --> 01:38:25,851
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

954
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,858
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

955
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:31,778
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

956
01:38:31,779 --> 01:38:34,822
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

957
01:38:34,823 --> 01:38:37,408
Mine! My own!

958
01:38:37,409 --> 01:38:39,702
Can't you hear yourself?

959
01:38:39,703 --> 01:38:44,703
Don't you know who you sound like?

960
01:38:51,632 --> 01:38:53,925
We wants it.

961
01:38:53,926 --> 01:38:56,803
We needs it.

962
01:38:56,804 --> 01:39:01,804
Must have the precious.

963
01:39:01,809 --> 01:39:05,395
They stole it from us.

964
01:39:05,396 --> 01:39:08,940
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

965
01:39:08,941 --> 01:39:12,985
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

966
01:39:12,986 --> 01:39:16,447
SMEAGOL
No. Not master.

967
01:39:16,448 --> 01:39:20,451
Yes, precious. False.

968
01:39:20,452 --> 01:39:25,452
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

969
01:39:26,083 --> 01:39:28,709
SMEAGOL Master's my friend.

970
01:39:28,710 --> 01:39:33,710
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

971
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:37,718
Not listening. I'm not listening.

972
01:39:37,719 --> 01:39:42,348
You're a liar and a thief.

973
01:39:42,349 --> 01:39:44,851
No.

974
01:39:44,852 --> 01:39:49,852
Murderer.

975
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:51,399
Go away.

976
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:55,778
Go away?

977
01:39:55,779 --> 01:39:58,739
I hate you.

978
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:01,451
I hate you.

979
01:40:01,452 --> 01:40:04,912
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

980
01:40:04,913 --> 01:40:06,914
I saved us.

981
01:40:06,915 --> 01:40:11,915
It was me. We survived because of me.

982
01:40:12,671 --> 01:40:17,592
Not anymore.

983
01:40:17,593 --> 01:40:21,220
What did you say?

984
01:40:21,221 --> 01:40:25,224
Master looks after us now.

985
01:40:25,225 --> 01:40:29,437
We don't need you.

986
01:40:29,438 --> 01:40:31,189
What?

987
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:33,107
Leave now...

988
01:40:33,108 --> 01:40:37,069
and never come back.

989
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:38,613
No.

990
01:40:38,614 --> 01:40:43,614
Leave now and never come back.

991
01:40:45,412 --> 01:40:50,412
Leave now and never come back!

992
01:41:03,305 --> 01:41:06,182
We told him to go away.

993
01:41:06,183 --> 01:41:09,310
And away he goes, precious.

994
01:41:09,311 --> 01:41:11,479
Gone! Gone! Gone!

995
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:16,480
Sméagol is free!

996
01:41:18,195 --> 01:41:19,862
SMEAGOL Look.

997
01:41:19,863 --> 01:41:24,700
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

998
01:41:33,877 --> 01:41:35,461
They are young.

999
01:41:35,462 --> 01:41:38,172
They are tender. They are nice.

1000
01:41:38,173 --> 01:41:43,173
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

1001
01:41:44,471 --> 01:41:47,223
You'll make him sick, you will...

1002
01:41:47,224 --> 01:41:51,811
behaving like that.

1003
01:41:51,812 --> 01:41:55,106
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

1004
01:41:58,777 --> 01:42:01,070
What's it doing?

1005
01:42:01,071 --> 01:42:03,906
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1006
01:42:03,907 --> 01:42:06,284
It ruins it.

1007
01:42:06,285 --> 01:42:10,580
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

1008
01:42:14,042 --> 01:42:17,503
What we need is a few good taters.

1009
01:42:17,504 --> 01:42:20,715
What's taters, precious?

1010
01:42:20,716 --> 01:42:22,633
What's taters? Eh?

1011
01:42:22,634 --> 01:42:24,677
Po-ta-toes.

1012
01:42:24,678 --> 01:42:29,432
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

1013
01:42:29,433 --> 01:42:34,433
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1014
01:42:36,231 --> 01:42:38,524
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1015
01:42:38,525 --> 01:42:40,818
Oh, yes, we could.

1016
01:42:40,819 --> 01:42:45,615
Spoil a nice fish.

1017
01:42:45,616 --> 01:42:48,409
Give it to us raw...

1018
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:51,621
and wriggling-

1019
01:42:51,622 --> 01:42:55,666
You keep nasty chips.

1020
01:42:55,667 --> 01:43:00,667
You're hopeless.

1021
01:43:10,265 --> 01:43:15,265
Mr. Frodo?

1022
01:43:29,660 --> 01:43:32,495
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1023
01:43:32,496 --> 01:43:35,748
Servants of Sauron.

1024
01:43:35,749 --> 01:43:38,125
They are called to Mordor.

1025
01:43:38,126 --> 01:43:41,337
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

1026
01:43:41,338 --> 01:43:46,092
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1027
01:43:46,093 --> 01:43:49,887
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1028
01:43:49,888 --> 01:43:54,888
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1029
01:43:55,352 --> 01:43:57,353
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1030
01:43:58,605 --> 01:44:00,314
Mr. Frodo.

1031
01:44:00,315 --> 01:44:05,315
Look.

1032
01:44:05,612 --> 01:44:09,615
It's an oliphaunt.

1033
01:44:16,123 --> 01:44:21,123
No one at home will believe this.

1034
01:44:30,262 --> 01:44:34,890
Sméagol?

1035
01:45:12,471 --> 01:45:17,471
We've lingered here too long.

1036
01:45:17,976 --> 01:45:22,976
Come on, Sam.

1037
01:45:31,364 --> 01:45:32,782
No!

1038
01:45:32,783 --> 01:45:37,203
- Wait! We're innocent travelers!
- Travelers?

1039
01:45:37,204 --> 01:45:42,204
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1040
01:45:42,459 --> 01:45:46,712
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1041
01:45:46,713 --> 01:45:50,257
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1042
01:45:50,258 --> 01:45:54,386
The enemy?

1043
01:45:54,387 --> 01:45:59,387
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

1044
01:46:00,352 --> 01:46:03,979
You wonder what his name is...

1045
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:08,234
where he came from.

1046
01:46:08,235 --> 01:46:12,321
And if he was really evil at heart.

1047
01:46:12,322 --> 01:46:17,322
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1048
01:46:17,369 --> 01:46:22,039
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1049
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:27,040
in peace.

1050
01:46:27,128 --> 01:46:30,339
War will make corpses of us all.

1051
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:35,340
Bind their hands.

1052
01:46:39,305 --> 01:46:42,265
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

1053
01:46:42,266 --> 01:46:46,061
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1054
01:46:46,062 --> 01:46:49,606
that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

1055
01:46:49,607 --> 01:46:51,775
It's the beards.

1056
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:54,027
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

1057
01:46:54,028 --> 01:46:57,072
that there are no Dwarf women...

1058
01:46:57,073 --> 01:47:02,073
and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

1059
01:47:02,995 --> 01:47:04,537
which is, of course, ridiculous.

1060
01:47:10,961 --> 01:47:13,672
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1061
01:47:13,673 --> 01:47:17,592
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

1062
01:47:17,593 --> 01:47:21,721
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1063
01:47:21,722 --> 01:47:24,641
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1064
01:47:24,642 --> 01:47:27,102
Cut down by Orcs.

1065
01:47:27,103 --> 01:47:30,730
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1066
01:47:30,731 --> 01:47:35,610
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

1067
01:47:35,611 --> 01:47:40,611
Doomed to wait upon an old man,
who should have loved her as a father.

1068
01:47:50,126 --> 01:47:52,669
Gimli.

1069
01:47:52,670 --> 01:47:54,921
No, I couldn't.

1070
01:47:54,922 --> 01:47:59,922
I really couldn't.

1071
01:48:01,262 --> 01:48:03,054
I made some stew.

1072
01:48:03,055 --> 01:48:08,055
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1073
01:48:14,150 --> 01:48:19,150
Thank you.

1074
01:48:36,714 --> 01:48:41,714
- It's good.
- Really?

1075
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:47,891
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1076
01:48:47,892 --> 01:48:52,395
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1077
01:48:52,396 --> 01:48:55,106
But he must be mistaken.

1078
01:48:55,107 --> 01:49:00,107
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1079
01:49:00,654 --> 01:49:05,654
Then you must be at least 60.

1080
01:49:05,951 --> 01:49:07,952
Seventy?

1081
01:49:07,953 --> 01:49:12,953
But you cannot be 80!

1082
01:49:12,958 --> 01:49:17,420
Eighty-seven.

1083
01:49:17,421 --> 01:49:20,590
You are one of the Dunedain.

1084
01:49:20,591 --> 01:49:24,928
A descendant of Numenor,
blessed with long life.

1085
01:49:24,929 --> 01:49:28,223
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1086
01:49:28,224 --> 01:49:30,141
There are few of us left.

1087
01:49:30,142 --> 01:49:33,728
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1088
01:49:33,729 --> 01:49:38,729
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1089
01:49:51,789 --> 01:49:56,709
<i>The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.</i>

1090
01:49:56,710 --> 01:50:01,710
<i>It is mine to give to whom I will.</i>

1091
01:50:01,966 --> 01:50:05,802
<i>Like my heart.</i>

1092
01:50:05,803 --> 01:50:08,680
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

1093
01:50:08,681 --> 01:50:13,681
I am asleep.

1094
01:50:17,648 --> 01:50:21,818
This is a dream.

1095
01:50:21,819 --> 01:50:26,819
Then it is a good dream.

1096
01:50:37,042 --> 01:50:42,042
Sleep.

1097
01:51:04,194 --> 01:51:08,156
You told me once...

1098
01:51:08,157 --> 01:51:11,367
this day would come.

1099
01:51:11,368 --> 01:51:14,162
This is not the end... it is the beginning.

1100
01:51:14,163 --> 01:51:17,040
You must go with Frodo.

1101
01:51:17,041 --> 01:51:22,041
That is your path.

1102
01:51:29,511 --> 01:51:32,931
My path is hidden from me.

1103
01:51:32,932 --> 01:51:36,684
It is already laid before your feet.

1104
01:51:36,685 --> 01:51:41,685
You cannot falter now.

1105
01:51:42,107 --> 01:51:46,527
Arwen...

1106
01:51:46,528 --> 01:51:49,197
If you trust nothing else...

1107
01:51:49,198 --> 01:51:52,450
trust this...

1108
01:51:52,451 --> 01:51:57,451
trust me.

1109
01:52:33,492 --> 01:52:36,494
Where is she?

1110
01:52:36,495 --> 01:52:41,495
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1111
01:52:42,251 --> 01:52:45,670
<i>ELROND'.
Our time here is ending.</i>

1112
01:52:45,671 --> 01:52:48,965
Arm/en's time is ending.

1113
01:52:48,966 --> 01:52:50,425
Let her go.

1114
01:52:50,426 --> 01:52:52,593
Let her take the ship into the west.

1115
01:52:52,594 --> 01:52:55,847
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

1116
01:52:55,848 --> 01:52:59,142
There it will be ever green.

1117
01:52:59,143 --> 01:53:02,770
But never more than memory.

1118
01:53:02,771 --> 01:53:06,024
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

1119
01:53:06,025 --> 01:53:09,819
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1120
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:14,820
She belongs with her people.

1121
01:53:24,585 --> 01:53:27,670
Is this how you would take your leave?

1122
01:53:27,671 --> 01:53:32,671
Did you think you could slip away at
first light - unnoticed?

1123
01:53:33,677 --> 01:53:36,929
I will not be coming back.

1124
01:53:36,930 --> 01:53:38,890
You underestimate your skill in battle.

1125
01:53:38,891 --> 01:53:40,516
You will come back.

1126
01:53:40,517 --> 01:53:42,727
It is not of death in battle that I speak.

1127
01:53:42,728 --> 01:53:47,728
What do you speak of?

1128
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:55,360
You have a chance for another life...

1129
01:53:55,407 --> 01:54:00,407
away from war... grief... despair.

1130
01:54:00,454 --> 01:54:03,873
Why are you saying this?

1131
01:54:03,874 --> 01:54:08,503
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1132
01:54:08,504 --> 01:54:11,589
It was a dream, Arwen.

1133
01:54:11,590 --> 01:54:14,342
Nothing more.

1134
01:54:14,343 --> 01:54:19,343
I don't believe you.

1135
01:54:26,563 --> 01:54:31,150
This belongs to you.

1136
01:54:31,151 --> 01:54:35,404
It was a gift.

1137
01:54:35,405 --> 01:54:39,408
Keep it.

1138
01:54:39,409 --> 01:54:43,412
My lord?

1139
01:54:43,413 --> 01:54:48,413
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1140
01:55:11,441 --> 01:55:14,443
What is it?

1141
01:55:14,444 --> 01:55:19,444
- Héma?
- I'm not sure.

1142
01:55:33,046 --> 01:55:38,046
Wargs!

1143
01:55:47,644 --> 01:55:52,644
A scout!

1144
01:55:55,652 --> 01:55:59,488
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1145
01:55:59,489 --> 01:56:04,489
Get them out of here!

1146
01:56:06,455 --> 01:56:09,165
All riders to the head of the column.

1147
01:56:09,166 --> 01:56:11,334
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1148
01:56:11,335 --> 01:56:15,046
Come on!

1149
01:56:24,890 --> 01:56:27,516
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1150
01:56:27,517 --> 01:56:31,687
- I can fight.
- No!

1151
01:56:31,688 --> 01:56:35,775
You must do this, for me.

1152
01:56:35,776 --> 01:56:40,776
Follow me! Hyah!

1153
01:56:40,864 --> 01:56:45,368
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

1154
01:56:45,369 --> 01:56:50,369
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1155
01:58:00,277 --> 01:58:05,277
Bring your pretty face to my axe.

1156
01:58:05,365 --> 01:58:10,365
That one counts as mine!

1157
01:58:23,633 --> 01:58:28,633
Stinking creature.

1158
01:59:52,514 --> 01:59:57,514
Aragorn!

1159
01:59:59,104 --> 02:00:04,104
Aragorn?

1160
02:00:14,578 --> 02:00:17,663
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

1161
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:19,665
He's...

1162
02:00:19,666 --> 02:00:21,917
."dead.

1163
02:00:21,918 --> 02:00:26,918
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1164
02:00:28,425 --> 02:00:30,217
You lie.

1165
02:01:03,627 --> 02:01:06,545
Get the wounded on horses.

1166
02:01:06,546 --> 02:01:10,132
The wolves of lsengard will return.

1167
02:01:10,133 --> 02:01:15,133
Leave the dead.

1168
02:01:19,643 --> 02:01:24,643
Come.

1169
02:01:31,321 --> 02:01:33,113
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

1170
02:01:33,114 --> 02:01:38,114
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1171
02:01:38,537 --> 02:01:41,872
We're safe!

1172
02:01:41,873 --> 02:01:44,917
We're safe, my lady.

1173
02:01:44,918 --> 02:01:49,918
Thank you.

1174
02:02:30,463 --> 02:02:32,047
- Mama!
- Eothain!

1175
02:02:32,048 --> 02:02:37,048
Freda!

1176
02:02:39,347 --> 02:02:44,347
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1177
02:02:46,021 --> 02:02:47,521
Take it to the caves.

1178
02:02:47,522 --> 02:02:52,234
Make way for the king.

1179
02:02:52,235 --> 02:02:57,235
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

1180
02:03:03,079 --> 02:03:08,079
So few. So few of you have returned.

1181
02:03:09,586 --> 02:03:13,213
Our people are safe.

1182
02:03:13,214 --> 02:03:16,592
We have paid for it with many lives.

1183
02:03:16,593 --> 02:03:21,593
My lady.

1184
02:03:21,848 --> 02:03:24,266
Lord Aragorn...

1185
02:03:24,267 --> 02:03:27,519
where is he?

1186
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:32,520
He fell.

1187
02:03:51,753 --> 02:03:54,880
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1188
02:03:54,881 --> 02:03:58,050
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1189
02:03:58,051 --> 02:04:01,303
What of those who cannot fight,
my lord? The women and children?

1190
02:04:01,304 --> 02:04:04,807
Get them into the caves.

1191
02:04:04,808 --> 02:04:09,808
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1192
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:15,275
<i>Helm's Deep has one weakness.</i>

1193
02:04:15,276 --> 02:04:17,778
<i>Its outer wall is solid rock...</i>

1194
02:04:17,779 --> 02:04:21,031
but <i>for</i> a <i>small culvert
at its base...</i>

1195
02:04:21,032 --> 02:04:26,032
<i>which is little more than a drain.</i>

1196
02:04:26,663 --> 02:04:30,999
How? How can fire undo stone?

1197
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:36,000
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1198
02:04:39,175 --> 02:04:43,345
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

1199
02:04:43,346 --> 02:04:47,015
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

1200
02:04:47,016 --> 02:04:49,768
thousands, to storm the Keep.

1201
02:04:49,769 --> 02:04:51,353
Tens of thousands.

1202
02:04:51,354 --> 02:04:55,607
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1203
02:05:07,370 --> 02:05:10,622
A new power is rising.

1204
02:05:10,623 --> 02:05:15,623
Its victory is at hand.

1205
02:05:19,299 --> 02:05:21,800
This night...

1206
02:05:21,801 --> 02:05:26,305
the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1207
02:05:26,306 --> 02:05:29,808
March to Helm's Deep!

1208
02:05:29,809 --> 02:05:34,809
Leave none alive!

1209
02:05:35,815 --> 02:05:40,815
To war!

1210
02:05:42,238 --> 02:05:47,238
There will be no dawn for Men.

1211
02:06:03,885 --> 02:06:06,094
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1212
02:06:06,095 --> 02:06:09,473
There is always smoke rising...

1213
02:06:09,474 --> 02:06:13,560
from lsengard these days.

1214
02:06:13,561 --> 02:06:15,354
Isengard?

1215
02:06:15,355 --> 02:06:17,564
There was a time...

1216
02:06:17,565 --> 02:06:21,276
when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1217
02:06:21,277 --> 02:06:25,280
But now he has a mind of metal...

1218
02:06:25,281 --> 02:06:28,492
and wheels.

1219
02:06:28,493 --> 02:06:33,163
He no longer cares for growing things.

1220
02:06:33,164 --> 02:06:38,164
What is it?

1221
02:06:39,963 --> 02:06:42,339
It's Saruman's army.

1222
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:47,340
The war has started.

1223
02:07:22,213 --> 02:07:27,213
<i>May the grace of the Valar
protect you.</i>

1224
02:07:58,875 --> 02:08:03,875
Brego.

1225
02:08:26,861 --> 02:08:29,363
Arwen.

1226
02:08:29,364 --> 02:08:33,283
It is time.

1227
02:08:33,284 --> 02:08:37,913
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.

1228
02:08:37,914 --> 02:08:42,914
I have made my choice.

1229
02:08:46,130 --> 02:08:50,425
He is not coming back.

1230
02:08:50,426 --> 02:08:54,680
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1231
02:08:54,681 --> 02:08:59,681
There is still hope.

1232
02:09:01,813 --> 02:09:06,813
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

1233
02:09:08,987 --> 02:09:12,114
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

1234
02:09:12,115 --> 02:09:14,783
and all that you hope for
comes true...

1235
02:09:14,784 --> 02:09:19,784
you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1236
02:09:19,789 --> 02:09:22,958
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

1237
02:09:22,959 --> 02:09:27,959
Aragorn will die.

1238
02:09:28,715 --> 02:09:31,466
<i>And there will be no comfort
for you...</i>

1239
02:09:31,467 --> 02:09:36,467
no <i>comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.</i>

1240
02:09:38,474 --> 02:09:41,393
<i>He will come to death...</i>

1241
02:09:41,394 --> 02:09:44,146
an <i>image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...</i>

1242
02:09:44,147 --> 02:09:49,147
in <i>glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.</i>

1243
02:09:57,910 --> 02:10:02,664
<i>But you, my daughter...</i>

1244
02:10:02,665 --> 02:10:07,665
<i>you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...</i>

1245
02:10:07,879 --> 02:10:12,879
as <i>nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.</i>

1246
02:10:14,343 --> 02:10:16,928
<i>Here you will dwell...</i>

1247
02:10:16,929 --> 02:10:21,929
<i>bound to your grief
under the fading trees...</i>

1248
02:10:23,561 --> 02:10:25,729
<i>until all the world is changed...</i>

1249
02:10:25,730 --> 02:10:30,730
and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1250
02:10:38,785 --> 02:10:43,785
Arwen.

1251
02:10:46,584 --> 02:10:49,544
There is nothing for you here...

1252
02:10:49,545 --> 02:10:54,545
only death.

1253
02:11:12,401 --> 02:11:17,155
Do I not also have your love?

1254
02:11:17,156 --> 02:11:22,156
You have my love, father.

1255
02:12:25,057 --> 02:12:28,852
The power of the <i>enemy is</i> growing.

1256
02:12:28,853 --> 02:12:31,646
<i>Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...</i>

1257
02:12:31,647 --> 02:12:36,647
<i>to destroy the people of Rohan.</i>

1258
02:12:37,153 --> 02:12:42,153
<i>Isengard has been unleashed.</i>

1259
02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:49,623
<i>The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...</i>

1260
02:12:49,624 --> 02:12:52,792
<i>the last free kingdom of Men.</i>

1261
02:12:52,793 --> 02:12:57,793
<i>His war on this country
will come swiftly.</i>

1262
02:13:00,885 --> 02:13:04,179
<i>He senses the Ring is close.</i>

1263
02:13:04,180 --> 02:13:07,807
<i>The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.</i>

1264
02:13:07,808 --> 02:13:12,808
<i>In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...</i>

1265
02:13:13,397 --> 02:13:17,442
the quest will claim his life.

1266
02:13:17,443 --> 02:13:20,195
You know this.

1267
02:13:20,196 --> 02:13:25,158
<i>You have foreseen it.</i>

1268
02:13:25,159 --> 02:13:30,159
<i>It is the risk we all took.</i>

1269
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:38,000
<i>In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.</i>

1270
02:13:38,381 --> 02:13:42,968
<i>It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.</i>

1271
02:13:42,969 --> 02:13:47,969
<i>Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.</i>

1272
02:13:48,641 --> 02:13:52,394
<i>The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...</i>

1273
02:13:52,395 --> 02:13:57,395
<i>take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.</i>

1274
02:13:58,901 --> 02:14:00,902
<i>It is close now.</i>

1275
02:14:00,903 --> 02:14:05,903
<i>So close to achieving its goal.</i>

1276
02:14:08,244 --> 02:14:12,080
<i>For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...</i>

1277
02:14:12,081 --> 02:14:17,081
<i>even unto the ending
of the world.</i>

1278
02:14:18,045 --> 02:14:20,088
<i>The time of the Elves...</i>

1279
02:14:20,089 --> 02:14:22,841
is over.

1280
02:14:22,842 --> 02:14:27,842
<i>Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?</i>

1281
02:14:28,389 --> 02:14:33,389
<i>Do we let them stand alone?</i>

1282
02:14:36,272 --> 02:14:37,772
What news?

1283
02:14:37,773 --> 02:14:40,775
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

1284
02:14:40,776 --> 02:14:43,778
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

1285
02:14:43,779 --> 02:14:47,991
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1286
02:14:47,992 --> 02:14:50,744
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1287
02:14:50,745 --> 02:14:53,038
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

1288
02:14:53,039 --> 02:14:57,542
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1289
02:14:57,543 --> 02:15:01,296
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1290
02:15:01,297 --> 02:15:06,297
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

1291
02:15:06,469 --> 02:15:08,803
Saruman attacks from lsengard.

1292
02:15:08,804 --> 02:15:12,807
Sauron from Mordor.

1293
02:15:12,808 --> 02:15:16,227
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

1294
02:15:16,228 --> 02:15:18,104
Gondor is weak.

1295
02:15:18,105 --> 02:15:21,983
Sauron will strike us soon.

1296
02:15:21,984 --> 02:15:24,277
And he will strike hard.

1297
02:15:24,278 --> 02:15:29,278
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1298
02:15:42,296 --> 02:15:44,672
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1299
02:15:44,673 --> 02:15:47,592
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1300
02:15:47,593 --> 02:15:52,593
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

1301
02:15:56,727 --> 02:15:59,562
Speak.

1302
02:15:59,563 --> 02:16:02,524
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1303
02:16:02,525 --> 02:16:05,944
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1304
02:16:05,945 --> 02:16:07,654
Your bodyguard?

1305
02:16:07,655 --> 02:16:10,031
His gardener.

1306
02:16:10,032 --> 02:16:13,535
And where is your skulking friend?

1307
02:16:13,536 --> 02:16:16,204
That gangrel creature.

1308
02:16:16,205 --> 02:16:19,874
He had an ill-favored look.

1309
02:16:19,875 --> 02:16:24,875
There was no other.

1310
02:16:25,881 --> 02:16:30,881
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

1311
02:16:31,554 --> 02:16:35,723
One we lost in Moria...

1312
02:16:35,724 --> 02:16:37,392
two were my kin...

1313
02:16:37,393 --> 02:16:41,312
a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

1314
02:16:41,313 --> 02:16:46,313
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

1315
02:16:50,239 --> 02:16:54,409
You're a friend of Boromir?

1316
02:16:54,410 --> 02:16:56,995
Yes.

1317
02:16:56,996 --> 02:17:01,996
For my part.

1318
02:17:04,587 --> 02:17:09,587
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1319
02:17:09,592 --> 02:17:11,217
Dead?

1320
02:17:11,218 --> 02:17:13,511
How? When?

1321
02:17:13,512 --> 02:17:16,473
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1322
02:17:16,474 --> 02:17:21,474
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1323
02:17:23,063 --> 02:17:28,063
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

1324
02:17:29,737 --> 02:17:34,491
It was cloven in two.

1325
02:17:34,492 --> 02:17:39,492
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1326
02:17:39,955 --> 02:17:44,955
He was my brother.

1327
02:18:30,631 --> 02:18:34,175
Boromir!

1328
02:18:34,176 --> 02:18:39,176
Boromir!

1329
02:18:40,307 --> 02:18:44,227
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

1330
02:18:44,228 --> 02:18:48,064
A place of light and beauty and music.

1331
02:18:48,065 --> 02:18:52,944
And so it shall be once more!

1332
02:18:52,945 --> 02:18:55,780
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1333
02:18:55,781 --> 02:19:00,781
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1334
02:19:03,956 --> 02:19:08,956
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1335
02:19:10,004 --> 02:19:12,130
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1336
02:19:12,131 --> 02:19:17,131
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1337
02:19:23,684 --> 02:19:26,603
Good speech. Nice and short.

1338
02:19:26,604 --> 02:19:29,814
Leaves more time for drinking!

1339
02:19:29,815 --> 02:19:34,815
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1340
02:19:37,531 --> 02:19:39,866
Remember today, little brother.

1341
02:19:39,867 --> 02:19:44,867
Today, life is good.

1342
02:19:47,041 --> 02:19:49,000
What?

1343
02:19:49,001 --> 02:19:53,671
He's here.

1344
02:19:53,672 --> 02:19:56,883
- Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
- Where is he?

1345
02:19:56,884 --> 02:20:00,887
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1346
02:20:00,888 --> 02:20:05,888
Father!

1347
02:20:07,436 --> 02:20:09,979
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1348
02:20:09,980 --> 02:20:14,859
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1349
02:20:14,860 --> 02:20:18,571
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1350
02:20:18,572 --> 02:20:21,032
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1351
02:20:21,033 --> 02:20:23,242
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

1352
02:20:23,243 --> 02:20:25,453
Oh, too few.

1353
02:20:25,454 --> 02:20:30,041
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1354
02:20:30,042 --> 02:20:33,294
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1355
02:20:33,295 --> 02:20:35,713
That is not my intent.

1356
02:20:35,714 --> 02:20:40,714
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

1357
02:20:42,846 --> 02:20:45,932
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1358
02:20:45,933 --> 02:20:48,851
I know his uses, and they are few.

1359
02:20:48,852 --> 02:20:53,648
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1360
02:20:53,649 --> 02:20:56,234
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1361
02:20:56,235 --> 02:20:59,278
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

1362
02:20:59,279 --> 02:21:04,279
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1363
02:21:05,285 --> 02:21:10,285
The One Ring.

1364
02:21:10,332 --> 02:21:15,169
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1365
02:21:15,170 --> 02:21:18,965
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1366
02:21:18,966 --> 02:21:23,966
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1367
02:21:24,888 --> 02:21:27,724
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1368
02:21:27,725 --> 02:21:31,602
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

1369
02:21:31,603 --> 02:21:35,732
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1370
02:21:35,733 --> 02:21:40,733
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

1371
02:21:41,196 --> 02:21:46,196
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1372
02:21:46,452 --> 02:21:48,119
He will return.

1373
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:52,039
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

1374
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:55,752
You must go.

1375
02:21:55,753 --> 02:21:58,713
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1376
02:21:58,714 --> 02:22:03,714
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1377
02:22:04,386 --> 02:22:08,222
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1378
02:22:08,223 --> 02:22:12,393
- send me in his stead.
- You?

1379
02:22:12,394 --> 02:22:14,479
Oh, I see.

1380
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:19,108
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

1381
02:22:19,109 --> 02:22:21,277
I think not.

1382
02:22:21,278 --> 02:22:24,322
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1383
02:22:24,323 --> 02:22:29,323
The one who will not fail me.

1384
02:22:44,384 --> 02:22:49,384
Remember today, little brother.

1385
02:23:05,906 --> 02:23:09,158
Captain Faramir!

1386
02:23:09,159 --> 02:23:14,159
We found the third one.

1387
02:23:22,798 --> 02:23:27,798
You must come with me. Now.

1388
02:23:36,019 --> 02:23:41,019
Down there.

1389
02:23:52,035 --> 02:23:57,035
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1390
02:24:05,507 --> 02:24:10,507
They wait for my command.

1391
02:24:12,514 --> 02:24:14,849
Shall I shoot?

1392
02:24:14,850 --> 02:24:18,019
<i>The rock and pool
ls nice and cool</i>

1393
02:24:18,020 --> 02:24:20,521
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1394
02:24:20,522 --> 02:24:23,649
<i>Our only wish To catch a fish</i>

1395
02:24:23,650 --> 02:24:28,650
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

1396
02:24:33,368 --> 02:24:36,245
Wait.

1397
02:24:36,246 --> 02:24:39,707
This creature is bound to me.

1398
02:24:39,708 --> 02:24:44,708
And I to him.

1399
02:24:44,880 --> 02:24:49,880
He is our guide.

1400
02:24:50,928 --> 02:24:52,511
Please...

1401
02:24:52,512 --> 02:24:57,512
let me go down to him.

1402
02:25:05,651 --> 02:25:08,319
Sméagol.

1403
02:25:08,320 --> 02:25:11,739
Master is here.

1404
02:25:11,740 --> 02:25:15,743
Come, Sméagol.

1405
02:25:15,744 --> 02:25:20,744
Trust master. Come.

1406
02:25:21,583 --> 02:25:25,753
We must go now?

1407
02:25:25,754 --> 02:25:29,382
Sméagol, you must trust master.

1408
02:25:29,383 --> 02:25:31,968
Follow me. Come on.

1409
02:25:31,969 --> 02:25:36,097
Come.

1410
02:25:36,098 --> 02:25:37,765
Come, Sméagol.

1411
02:25:37,766 --> 02:25:40,351
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

1412
02:25:40,352 --> 02:25:43,729
Come on.

1413
02:25:46,274 --> 02:25:48,109
Don't hurt him!

1414
02:25:48,110 --> 02:25:51,028
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

1415
02:25:51,029 --> 02:25:55,408
Master!

1416
02:26:17,514 --> 02:26:22,514
That's enough.

1417
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:25,855
Where are you leading them?

1418
02:26:27,482 --> 02:26:29,984
Answer me.

1419
02:26:29,985 --> 02:26:33,529
Sméagol.

1420
02:26:36,658 --> 02:26:41,658
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

1421
02:26:42,664 --> 02:26:45,458
SMEAGOL Cruel Men hurts us.

1422
02:26:45,459 --> 02:26:48,627
Master tricksed us.

1423
02:26:48,628 --> 02:26:52,548
Of course he did.

1424
02:26:52,549 --> 02:26:56,427
I told you he was tricksy.

1425
02:26:56,428 --> 02:26:59,638
I told you he was false.

1426
02:26:59,639 --> 02:27:02,516
SMEAGOL Master is our friend.

1427
02:27:02,517 --> 02:27:05,019
Our friend.

1428
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:07,354
Master betrayed us.

1429
02:27:07,355 --> 02:27:11,442
SMEAGOL
No. Not its business.

1430
02:27:11,443 --> 02:27:14,028
Leave us alone!

1431
02:27:14,029 --> 02:27:16,614
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1432
02:27:16,615 --> 02:27:19,075
They stole it from us!

1433
02:27:19,076 --> 02:27:21,077
SMEAGOL
No. No.

1434
02:27:21,078 --> 02:27:24,872
What did they steal?

1435
02:27:24,873 --> 02:27:29,873
My precious!

1436
02:27:33,882 --> 02:27:36,133
We have to get out of here.

1437
02:27:36,134 --> 02:27:40,721
You go. Go, now.

1438
02:27:40,722 --> 02:27:44,016
You can do it.

1439
02:27:44,017 --> 02:27:45,643
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1440
02:27:45,644 --> 02:27:47,603
Just this once.

1441
02:27:47,604 --> 02:27:49,814
Put it on.

1442
02:27:49,815 --> 02:27:52,900
Disappear.

1443
02:27:52,901 --> 02:27:57,071
I can't.

1444
02:27:57,072 --> 02:28:00,741
You were right, Sam.

1445
02:28:00,742 --> 02:28:05,742
You tried to tell me but...

1446
02:28:07,916 --> 02:28:12,916
I'm sorry.

1447
02:28:14,631 --> 02:28:18,926
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1448
02:28:18,927 --> 02:28:20,761
If I put it on...

1449
02:28:20,762 --> 02:28:24,765
he'll find me.

1450
02:28:24,766 --> 02:28:27,935
He'll see.

1451
02:28:27,936 --> 02:28:32,936
Mr. Frodo...

1452
02:28:34,860 --> 02:28:39,860
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1453
02:28:41,324 --> 02:28:44,493
Here in the Wild I have you...

1454
02:28:44,494 --> 02:28:46,579
two Halflings...

1455
02:28:46,580 --> 02:28:51,580
and a host of men at my call.

1456
02:28:53,044 --> 02:28:58,044
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1457
02:29:06,224 --> 02:29:11,224
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

1458
02:29:11,563 --> 02:29:16,563
to show his quality.

1459
02:29:35,712 --> 02:29:40,507
No!

1460
02:29:40,508 --> 02:29:42,009
Stop it!

1461
02:29:42,010 --> 02:29:44,386
Leave him alone.

1462
02:29:44,387 --> 02:29:48,182
Don't you understand?

1463
02:29:48,183 --> 02:29:50,267
He's got to destroy it!

1464
02:29:50,268 --> 02:29:53,687
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1465
02:29:53,688 --> 02:29:56,398
To the Mountain of Fire!

1466
02:29:56,399 --> 02:29:59,693
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1467
02:29:59,694 --> 02:30:04,694
Please. It's such a burden.

1468
02:30:04,866 --> 02:30:08,285
Will you not help him?

1469
02:30:08,286 --> 02:30:10,871
Captain?

1470
02:30:10,872 --> 02:30:15,872
Prepare to leave.

1471
02:30:18,046 --> 02:30:23,046
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1472
02:31:33,455 --> 02:31:36,290
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1473
02:31:36,291 --> 02:31:39,501
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1474
02:31:39,502 --> 02:31:43,464
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1475
02:31:43,465 --> 02:31:48,135
and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1476
02:31:48,136 --> 02:31:50,220
Bless you, laddie.

1477
02:31:50,221 --> 02:31:55,221
Gimli, where is the king?

1478
02:32:00,982 --> 02:32:05,736
You're late.

1479
02:32:05,737 --> 02:32:10,737
You look terrible.

1480
02:32:48,822 --> 02:32:51,031
A great host, you say?

1481
02:32:51,032 --> 02:32:52,658
All lsengard is emptied.

1482
02:32:52,659 --> 02:32:54,368
How many?

1483
02:32:54,369 --> 02:32:58,914
Ten thousand strong at least.

1484
02:32:58,915 --> 02:33:00,791
Ten thousand?

1485
02:33:00,792 --> 02:33:05,792
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1486
02:33:05,964 --> 02:33:10,592
To destroy the world of Men.

1487
02:33:10,593 --> 02:33:15,593
They will be here by nightfall.

1488
02:33:18,435 --> 02:33:21,228
Let them come!

1489
02:33:21,229 --> 02:33:24,189
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

1490
02:33:24,190 --> 02:33:29,190
to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1491
02:33:35,577 --> 02:33:38,662
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1492
02:33:38,663 --> 02:33:41,248
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

1493
02:33:41,249 --> 02:33:44,168
or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1494
02:33:44,169 --> 02:33:47,171
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1495
02:33:47,172 --> 02:33:49,548
These are Uruk-hai.

1496
02:33:49,549 --> 02:33:54,549
Their Armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1497
02:33:54,596 --> 02:33:58,432
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1498
02:33:58,433 --> 02:34:03,433
I know how to defend my own keep.

1499
02:34:08,651 --> 02:34:12,237
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1500
02:34:12,238 --> 02:34:17,238
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1501
02:34:17,660 --> 02:34:20,496
Crops can be resown...

1502
02:34:20,497 --> 02:34:24,124
homes rebuilt.

1503
02:34:24,125 --> 02:34:27,044
Within these walls...

1504
02:34:27,045 --> 02:34:28,712
we will outlast them.

1505
02:34:28,713 --> 02:34:31,298
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1506
02:34:31,299 --> 02:34:33,008
They come to destroy its people...

1507
02:34:33,009 --> 02:34:36,386
down to the last child.

1508
02:34:36,387 --> 02:34:38,805
What would you have me do?

1509
02:34:38,806 --> 02:34:40,724
Look at my men.

1510
02:34:40,725 --> 02:34:44,645
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1511
02:34:44,646 --> 02:34:49,233
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

1512
02:34:49,234 --> 02:34:54,234
as to be worthy of remembrance.

1513
02:34:55,907 --> 02:34:58,116
Send out riders, my lord.

1514
02:34:58,117 --> 02:35:03,117
You must call for aid.

1515
02:35:04,249 --> 02:35:06,917
And who will come?

1516
02:35:06,918 --> 02:35:08,669
Elves?

1517
02:35:08,670 --> 02:35:11,505
Dwarves?

1518
02:35:11,506 --> 02:35:15,217
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1519
02:35:15,218 --> 02:35:17,928
The old alliances are dead.

1520
02:35:17,929 --> 02:35:20,889
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1521
02:35:20,890 --> 02:35:24,059
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1522
02:35:24,060 --> 02:35:27,479
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1523
02:35:27,480 --> 02:35:32,067
<i>Where was Gon-?</i>

1524
02:35:32,068 --> 02:35:35,612
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1525
02:35:35,613 --> 02:35:40,613
we are alone.

1526
02:35:44,956 --> 02:35:46,873
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1527
02:35:46,874 --> 02:35:48,292
We need more time
to lay provisions...

1528
02:35:48,293 --> 02:35:52,045
There is no time. War is upon us.

1529
02:35:52,046 --> 02:35:54,423
Secure the gate.

1530
02:35:58,970 --> 02:36:01,263
We Ents have not troubled...

1531
02:36:01,264 --> 02:36:05,392
about the wars of Men and wizards...

1532
02:36:05,393 --> 02:36:09,646
for a very long time.

1533
02:36:09,647 --> 02:36:14,568
But now, something
is about to happen...

1534
02:36:14,569 --> 02:36:17,112
that has not happened...

1535
02:36:17,113 --> 02:36:20,782
for an age.

1536
02:36:20,783 --> 02:36:23,452
Entmoot.

1537
02:36:23,453 --> 02:36:24,911
What's that?

1538
02:36:24,912 --> 02:36:28,915
'Tis a gathering.

1539
02:36:28,916 --> 02:36:31,793
A gathering of what?

1540
02:36:49,437 --> 02:36:51,938
Beech. Oak.

1541
02:36:51,939 --> 02:36:54,107
Chestnut. Ash.

1542
02:36:54,108 --> 02:36:56,276
Good. Good. Good.

1543
02:36:56,277 --> 02:37:01,277
Many have come.

1544
02:37:06,162 --> 02:37:09,122
Now we must decide
if the Ents...

1545
02:37:09,123 --> 02:37:14,123
will go to war.

1546
02:37:20,635 --> 02:37:25,635
Move back! Move to the caves!

1547
02:37:26,140 --> 02:37:28,642
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1548
02:37:28,643 --> 02:37:31,103
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1549
02:37:31,104 --> 02:37:33,563
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1550
02:37:33,564 --> 02:37:36,858
Aragorn, you must rest.

1551
02:37:36,859 --> 02:37:38,527
You're no use to us half alive.

1552
02:37:39,737 --> 02:37:44,324
Aragorn!

1553
02:37:44,325 --> 02:37:47,536
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1554
02:37:47,537 --> 02:37:49,371
That is an honorable charge.

1555
02:37:49,372 --> 02:37:52,416
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1556
02:37:52,417 --> 02:37:54,292
What renown is there in that?

1557
02:37:54,293 --> 02:37:58,255
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

1558
02:37:58,256 --> 02:38:01,216
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1559
02:38:01,217 --> 02:38:06,217
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1560
02:38:06,514 --> 02:38:09,516
You do not command
the others to stay!

1561
02:38:09,517 --> 02:38:14,438
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1562
02:38:14,439 --> 02:38:19,439
Because they love you.

1563
02:38:23,740 --> 02:38:28,740
I'm sorry.

1564
02:39:31,182 --> 02:39:35,560
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1565
02:39:35,561 --> 02:39:39,606
These are no soldiers.

1566
02:39:39,607 --> 02:39:44,607
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1567
02:39:47,031 --> 02:39:50,116
Look at them. They're frightened.

1568
02:39:50,117 --> 02:39:55,117
I can see it in their eyes.

1569
02:39:56,791 --> 02:39:58,959
And they should be...

1570
02:39:58,960 --> 02:40:03,797
Three hundred... against ten thousand!

1571
02:40:03,798 --> 02:40:06,049
They have more hope of
defending themselves here than at Edoras...

1572
02:40:06,050 --> 02:40:07,467
Aragorn.

1573
02:40:07,468 --> 02:40:11,054
They cannot win this fight.

1574
02:40:11,055 --> 02:40:12,514
They are all going to die!

1575
02:40:12,515 --> 02:40:17,515
Then I shall die as one of them!

1576
02:40:21,148 --> 02:40:23,567
Let him go, lad.

1577
02:40:23,568 --> 02:40:26,987
Let him be.

1578
02:40:26,988 --> 02:40:31,988
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1579
02:40:36,747 --> 02:40:40,709
My lord?

1580
02:40:40,710 --> 02:40:45,710
Who am I, Gamling?

1581
02:40:46,674 --> 02:40:51,674
You are our king, sire.

1582
02:40:53,556 --> 02:40:58,351
And do you trust your king?

1583
02:40:58,352 --> 02:41:01,688
Your men, my lord...

1584
02:41:01,689 --> 02:41:06,689
will follow you to whatever end.

1585
02:41:11,365 --> 02:41:16,365
To whatever end.

1586
02:41:23,127 --> 02:41:26,880
Where is the horse and the rider?

1587
02:41:26,881 --> 02:41:31,426
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1588
02:41:31,427 --> 02:41:36,427
<i>They have passed like rain
on the mountains.</i>

1589
02:41:36,891 --> 02:41:41,891
<i>Like wind in the meadow.</i>

1590
02:41:43,773 --> 02:41:48,234
The days have gone down in the West...

1591
02:41:48,235 --> 02:41:52,781
<i>behind the hills...</i>

1592
02:41:52,782 --> 02:41:57,782
<i>into Shadow.</i>

1593
02:42:02,875 --> 02:42:07,875
How did it come to this?

1594
02:42:22,603 --> 02:42:27,603
Huh?

1595
02:42:27,608 --> 02:42:30,610
It's been going for hours.

1596
02:42:30,611 --> 02:42:33,196
They must have decided something
by now.

1597
02:42:33,197 --> 02:42:37,450
Decided? No.

1598
02:42:37,451 --> 02:42:42,451
We only just finished saying...

1599
02:42:43,791 --> 02:42:47,002
good morning.

1600
02:42:47,003 --> 02:42:50,380
But it's nighttime already.

1601
02:42:50,381 --> 02:42:53,174
You can't take forever.

1602
02:42:53,175 --> 02:42:55,677
Don't be hasty.

1603
02:42:55,678 --> 02:43:00,678
We're running out of time!

1604
02:43:01,142 --> 02:43:06,142
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1605
02:43:21,620 --> 02:43:26,620
Give me your sword.

1606
02:43:32,423 --> 02:43:34,174
What is your name?

1607
02:43:34,175 --> 02:43:38,678
Haleth, son of Héma, my lord.

1608
02:43:38,679 --> 02:43:43,266
The men are saying that
we will not live out the night.

1609
02:43:43,267 --> 02:43:48,267
They say that it is hopeless.

1610
02:44:03,037 --> 02:44:06,706
This is a good sword.

1611
02:44:06,707 --> 02:44:11,707
Haleth, son of Héma...

1612
02:44:13,380 --> 02:44:18,380
there is always hope.

1613
02:44:38,531 --> 02:44:42,075
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1614
02:44:42,076 --> 02:44:43,785
Forgive me.

1615
02:44:43,786 --> 02:44:48,414
I was wrong to despair.

1616
02:44:48,415 --> 02:44:53,415
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.

1617
02:44:54,088 --> 02:44:59,088
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1618
02:45:00,678 --> 02:45:05,390
It's a little tight across the chest.

1619
02:45:08,936 --> 02:45:13,936
That is no Orc horn.

1620
02:45:16,569 --> 02:45:18,570
Send for the king.

1621
02:45:18,571 --> 02:45:23,571
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

1622
02:45:53,814 --> 02:45:56,482
How is this possible?

1623
02:45:56,483 --> 02:46:00,320
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1624
02:46:00,321 --> 02:46:04,240
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1625
02:46:04,241 --> 02:46:09,241
Long ago we fought and died together.

1626
02:46:10,748 --> 02:46:14,083
We come to honor that allegiance.

1627
02:46:22,134 --> 02:46:27,134
You are most welcome.

1628
02:46:29,433 --> 02:46:34,433
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1629
02:47:07,012 --> 02:47:12,012
You could have picked a better spot.

1630
02:47:15,104 --> 02:47:20,104
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1631
02:47:25,447 --> 02:47:27,865
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1632
02:47:27,866 --> 02:47:32,866
Let's hope they last the night.

1633
02:48:30,346 --> 02:48:35,099
Show them no mercy...

1634
02:48:35,100 --> 02:48:40,100
for you shall receive none!

1635
02:49:11,804 --> 02:49:15,890
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1636
02:49:15,891 --> 02:49:20,728
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1637
02:49:57,182 --> 02:50:00,435
HOLD!

1638
02:50:20,873 --> 02:50:25,873
So it begins.

1639
02:50:28,589 --> 02:50:33,589
Prepare to fire!

1640
02:50:38,765 --> 02:50:41,142
Their Armour is weak at the neck...

1641
02:50:41,143 --> 02:50:42,852
and beneath the arm.

1642
02:50:42,853 --> 02:50:47,853
Release Arrows!

1643
02:50:49,568 --> 02:50:51,569
Did they hit anything?

1644
02:50:51,570 --> 02:50:53,738
Give them a volley.

1645
02:50:53,739 --> 02:50:58,739
- Fire!
- Fire!

1646
02:51:11,590 --> 02:51:16,590
Send them to me! Come on!

1647
02:51:32,819 --> 02:51:34,070
Ladders!

1648
02:51:34,071 --> 02:51:39,071
Good!

1649
02:51:41,912 --> 02:51:46,912
Swords! Swords!

1650
02:52:22,995 --> 02:52:25,288
Legolas! Two already!

1651
02:52:25,289 --> 02:52:27,582
I'm on 17!

1652
02:52:27,583 --> 02:52:32,583
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1653
02:52:36,967 --> 02:52:41,967
Nineteen!

1654
02:53:04,661 --> 02:53:09,661
Merry.

1655
02:53:10,500 --> 02:53:15,500
We have just agreed.

1656
02:53:24,306 --> 02:53:27,266
Yes?

1657
02:53:27,267 --> 02:53:32,267
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1658
02:53:32,564 --> 02:53:36,275
and we have agreed...

1659
02:53:36,276 --> 02:53:41,276
you are not Orcs.

1660
02:53:42,074 --> 02:53:44,367
Well, that's good news.

1661
02:53:44,368 --> 02:53:49,121
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1662
02:53:49,122 --> 02:53:53,084
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1663
02:53:53,085 --> 02:53:55,419
Hasty?

1664
02:53:55,420 --> 02:53:57,463
Our friends are out there.

1665
02:53:57,464 --> 02:54:01,967
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1666
02:54:01,968 --> 02:54:04,428
War'? Yes.

1667
02:54:04,429 --> 02:54:06,472
It affects us all.

1668
02:54:06,473 --> 02:54:10,351
Tree, root and twig.

1669
02:54:10,352 --> 02:54:14,605
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1670
02:54:14,606 --> 02:54:16,691
it takes a long time...

1671
02:54:16,692 --> 02:54:21,692
to say anything in Old Entish...

1672
02:54:21,780 --> 02:54:26,158
and we never say anything...

1673
02:54:26,159 --> 02:54:30,246
unless it is worth taking...

1674
02:54:30,247 --> 02:54:35,084
a long time to say.

1675
02:54:35,085 --> 02:54:38,546
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1676
02:54:38,547 --> 02:54:40,172
Nineteen!

1677
02:54:40,173 --> 02:54:42,216
Twenty!

1678
02:54:42,217 --> 02:54:47,217
Twenty-one!

1679
02:54:53,979 --> 02:54:55,187
Causeway!

1680
02:55:03,739 --> 02:55:06,282
Is this it?

1681
02:55:06,283 --> 02:55:11,283
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?

1682
02:55:35,604 --> 02:55:40,316
Bring him down, Legolas!

1683
02:55:40,317 --> 02:55:41,317
Kill him!

1684
02:55:41,318 --> 02:55:46,318
Kill him!

1685
02:56:35,205 --> 02:56:40,205
Brace the gate!

1686
02:56:54,891 --> 02:56:59,891
Hold them! Stand firm!

1687
02:57:05,026 --> 02:57:10,026
Aragorn!

1688
02:57:10,991 --> 02:57:15,991
Gimli!

1689
02:57:22,794 --> 02:57:27,794
Charge!

1690
02:58:00,957 --> 02:58:05,669
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1691
02:58:05,670 --> 02:58:10,507
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1692
02:58:10,508 --> 02:58:13,260
How can that be your decision?!

1693
02:58:13,261 --> 02:58:17,181
This is not our war.

1694
02:58:17,182 --> 02:58:22,182
But you're part of this world!

1695
02:58:23,521 --> 02:58:26,315
Aren't you?!

1696
02:58:29,444 --> 02:58:33,113
You must help. Please.

1697
02:58:33,114 --> 02:58:36,158
You must do something.

1698
02:58:36,159 --> 02:58:41,159
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1699
02:58:41,665 --> 02:58:45,542
But your part in this tale is over.

1700
02:58:45,543 --> 02:58:50,543
Go back to your home.

1701
02:58:57,806 --> 02:59:00,224
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1702
02:59:00,225 --> 02:59:02,267
We don't belong here, Merry.

1703
02:59:02,268 --> 02:59:04,728
It's too big for us.

1704
02:59:04,729 --> 02:59:09,692
What can we do in the end?

1705
02:59:09,693 --> 02:59:12,861
We've got the Shire.

1706
02:59:12,862 --> 02:59:17,241
Maybe we should go home.

1707
02:59:17,242 --> 02:59:20,619
The fires of lsengard will spread...

1708
02:59:20,620 --> 02:59:25,620
and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1709
02:59:25,709 --> 02:59:29,086
And...

1710
02:59:29,087 --> 02:59:34,087
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1711
02:59:35,719 --> 02:59:40,719
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1712
02:59:58,158 --> 02:59:59,575
Aragorn!

1713
02:59:59,576 --> 03:00:02,119
Fall back to the Keep!

1714
03:00:02,120 --> 03:00:06,331
Get your men out of there!

1715
03:00:06,332 --> 03:00:11,332
To the Keep!

1716
03:00:12,672 --> 03:00:14,840
Pull back to the Keep!

1717
03:00:14,841 --> 03:00:17,301
Haldir!

1718
03:00:17,302 --> 03:00:20,637
To the Keep!

1719
03:00:20,638 --> 03:00:24,141
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1720
03:00:43,119 --> 03:00:48,119
Haldir!

1721
03:01:27,038 --> 03:01:30,749
Brace the gate!

1722
03:01:30,750 --> 03:01:33,877
Hold them!

1723
03:01:33,878 --> 03:01:38,878
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1724
03:02:05,410 --> 03:02:10,247
Make way!

1725
03:02:10,248 --> 03:02:15,248
We cannot hold much longer!

1726
03:02:17,922 --> 03:02:21,675
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1727
03:02:21,676 --> 03:02:24,428
As long as you can give me.

1728
03:02:24,429 --> 03:02:27,556
Gimli!

1729
03:02:27,557 --> 03:02:29,099
Timbers!

1730
03:02:29,100 --> 03:02:34,100
Brace the gate!

1731
03:02:45,825 --> 03:02:48,368
Come on. We can take them.

1732
03:02:48,369 --> 03:02:53,369
It's a long way.

1733
03:02:55,251 --> 03:02:58,170
Toss me.

1734
03:02:58,171 --> 03:03:00,172
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1735
03:03:00,173 --> 03:03:05,173
You'll have to toss me!

1736
03:03:07,347 --> 03:03:09,139
Don't tell the Elf.

1737
03:03:09,140 --> 03:03:14,140
Not a word.

1738
03:03:26,157 --> 03:03:27,783
Shore up the door!

1739
03:03:27,784 --> 03:03:30,035
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1740
03:03:30,036 --> 03:03:35,036
Watch our backs!

1741
03:03:35,250 --> 03:03:40,250
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1742
03:04:27,427 --> 03:04:32,427
Hold fast the gate!

1743
03:04:33,057 --> 03:04:38,057
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1744
03:04:40,732 --> 03:04:45,732
Aragorn!

1745
03:05:15,767 --> 03:05:18,602
Pull everybody back.

1746
03:05:18,603 --> 03:05:20,937
Pull them back.

1747
03:05:20,938 --> 03:05:22,564
Fall back!

1748
03:05:22,565 --> 03:05:26,234
Fall back!

1749
03:05:26,235 --> 03:05:27,986
They have broken through!

1750
03:05:27,987 --> 03:05:30,530
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1751
03:05:30,531 --> 03:05:32,949
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1752
03:05:32,950 --> 03:05:35,702
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1753
03:05:35,703 --> 03:05:40,703
Into the Keep!

1754
03:05:49,425 --> 03:05:54,425
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1755
03:05:54,555 --> 03:05:59,555
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1756
03:06:04,982 --> 03:06:07,150
Wait! Stop!

1757
03:06:07,151 --> 03:06:11,780
Stop!

1758
03:06:11,781 --> 03:06:14,408
Turn around.

1759
03:06:14,409 --> 03:06:17,285
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1760
03:06:17,286 --> 03:06:22,286
But that will lead you past lsengard.

1761
03:06:22,625 --> 03:06:25,502
Yes. Exactly.

1762
03:06:25,503 --> 03:06:28,880
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1763
03:06:28,881 --> 03:06:31,716
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1764
03:06:31,717 --> 03:06:36,346
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1765
03:06:36,347 --> 03:06:39,516
That doesn't make sense to me.

1766
03:06:39,517 --> 03:06:40,851
But then...

1767
03:06:40,852 --> 03:06:44,020
you are very small.

1768
03:06:44,021 --> 03:06:48,442
Perhaps you're right.

1769
03:06:48,443 --> 03:06:51,486
South it is, then.

1770
03:06:51,487 --> 03:06:56,487
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1771
03:06:56,868 --> 03:06:59,786
I always like going south.

1772
03:06:59,787 --> 03:07:04,708
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1773
03:07:04,709 --> 03:07:07,335
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1774
03:07:07,336 --> 03:07:10,005
No, we won't.

1775
03:07:10,006 --> 03:07:15,006
Not this time.

1776
03:07:18,890 --> 03:07:21,558
Look!

1777
03:07:21,559 --> 03:07:24,186
Osgiliath burns!

1778
03:07:24,187 --> 03:07:26,730
Mordor has come.

1779
03:07:26,731 --> 03:07:30,484
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1780
03:07:30,485 --> 03:07:33,570
It has only the power to destroy.

1781
03:07:33,571 --> 03:07:35,197
Please...

1782
03:07:35,198 --> 03:07:37,866
let me go.

1783
03:07:37,867 --> 03:07:42,867
Hurry.

1784
03:07:42,914 --> 03:07:44,498
Faramir!

1785
03:07:44,499 --> 03:07:47,417
You must let me go!

1786
03:07:47,418 --> 03:07:51,046
And those little family of field mice...

1787
03:07:51,047 --> 03:07:54,591
that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1788
03:07:54,592 --> 03:07:58,345
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

1789
03:08:09,106 --> 03:08:12,734
Many of these trees were my friends.

1790
03:08:12,735 --> 03:08:17,735
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1791
03:08:18,533 --> 03:08:19,908
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1792
03:08:19,909 --> 03:08:24,909
They had voices of their own.

1793
03:08:24,914 --> 03:08:27,791
Saruman.

1794
03:08:27,792 --> 03:08:32,792
A wizard should know better!

1795
03:08:45,142 --> 03:08:48,979
There is no curse in Elvish...

1796
03:08:48,980 --> 03:08:51,815
Entish or the tongues of Men...

1797
03:08:51,816 --> 03:08:55,569
for this treachery.

1798
03:08:55,570 --> 03:09:00,570
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1799
03:09:03,119 --> 03:09:04,828
Where are they going?

1800
03:09:04,829 --> 03:09:08,540
They have business with the Orcs.

1801
03:09:08,541 --> 03:09:13,003
My business is with lsengard tonight...

1802
03:09:13,004 --> 03:09:16,006
with rock and stone.

1803
03:09:39,530 --> 03:09:41,781
Yes.

1804
03:09:41,782 --> 03:09:44,534
Come, my friends.

1805
03:09:44,535 --> 03:09:48,913
The Ents are going to war.

1806
03:09:48,914 --> 03:09:50,874
<i>It is likely...</i>

1807
03:09:50,875 --> 03:09:55,795
that we go to our doom.

1808
03:09:55,796 --> 03:09:58,798
Last march...

1809
03:09:58,799 --> 03:10:03,799
of the Ents.

1810
03:10:48,933 --> 03:10:52,852
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1811
03:10:52,853 --> 03:10:57,691
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1812
03:10:57,692 --> 03:10:59,442
Mr. Frodo?

1813
03:10:59,443 --> 03:11:03,738
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1814
03:11:03,739 --> 03:11:08,739
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1815
03:11:20,548 --> 03:11:23,508
Take them to my father.

1816
03:11:23,509 --> 03:11:28,509
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1817
03:11:28,931 --> 03:11:33,143
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1818
03:11:33,144 --> 03:11:36,479
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1819
03:11:36,480 --> 03:11:39,733
You want to know
why your brother died?

1820
03:11:39,734 --> 03:11:43,653
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1821
03:11:43,654 --> 03:11:45,697
He tried to kill him!

1822
03:11:45,698 --> 03:11:48,825
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1823
03:11:48,826 --> 03:11:53,826
Watch out!

1824
03:12:01,589 --> 03:12:05,341
Mr. Frodo?

1825
03:12:05,342 --> 03:12:10,305
They're here.

1826
03:12:10,306 --> 03:12:13,391
They've come.

1827
03:12:15,352 --> 03:12:17,437
Nazgoul

1828
03:12:39,376 --> 03:12:43,338
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1829
03:12:43,339 --> 03:12:48,339
Take cover!

1830
03:13:02,900 --> 03:13:05,235
The fortress is taken.

1831
03:13:05,236 --> 03:13:06,569
It is over.

1832
03:13:06,570 --> 03:13:10,698
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1833
03:13:10,699 --> 03:13:15,699
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1834
03:13:16,372 --> 03:13:20,416
They're breaking in!

1835
03:13:20,417 --> 03:13:25,417
They're past the door!

1836
03:13:26,257 --> 03:13:31,257
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1837
03:13:33,055 --> 03:13:36,558
Is there no other way?

1838
03:13:36,559 --> 03:13:40,270
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1839
03:13:40,271 --> 03:13:45,271
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1840
03:13:47,361 --> 03:13:49,946
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1841
03:13:49,947 --> 03:13:54,947
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1842
03:13:54,952 --> 03:13:59,952
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1843
03:14:03,043 --> 03:14:08,043
Ride out with me.

1844
03:14:08,591 --> 03:14:10,967
Ride out and meet them.

1845
03:14:10,968 --> 03:14:13,303
For death and glory.

1846
03:14:13,304 --> 03:14:16,222
For Rohan.

1847
03:14:16,223 --> 03:14:18,433
For your people.

1848
03:14:18,434 --> 03:14:23,434
The sun is rising.

1849
03:14:24,857 --> 03:14:28,026
<i>Look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day.</i>

1850
03:14:28,027 --> 03:14:29,611
<i>At</i> dawn...

1851
03:14:29,612 --> 03:14:34,612
<i>look to the east.</i>

1852
03:14:35,492 --> 03:14:39,621
Yes.

1853
03:14:39,622 --> 03:14:42,624
Yes.

1854
03:14:42,625 --> 03:14:45,168
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1855
03:14:45,169 --> 03:14:48,421
shall sound in the Deep...

1856
03:14:48,422 --> 03:14:50,590
one last time.

1857
03:14:50,591 --> 03:14:55,136
Yes!

1858
03:14:55,137 --> 03:15:00,137
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1859
03:15:06,690 --> 03:15:09,233
Fell deeds, awake.

1860
03:15:09,234 --> 03:15:10,526
Now for wrath...

1861
03:15:10,527 --> 03:15:14,530
now for ruin and a red dawn.

1862
03:15:20,955 --> 03:15:23,498
Forth Eorlingas!

1863
03:16:11,005 --> 03:16:16,005
Gandalf.

1864
03:16:19,513 --> 03:16:23,766
Théoden King stands alone.

1865
03:16:23,767 --> 03:16:26,352
Not alone.

1866
03:16:26,353 --> 03:16:31,353
Rohirrim!

1867
03:16:33,402 --> 03:16:34,736
Eomer.

1868
03:16:34,737 --> 03:16:39,737
To the king!

1869
03:17:54,858 --> 03:17:57,193
Yes!

1870
03:18:05,786 --> 03:18:09,247
A hit. A fine hit.

1871
03:18:33,772 --> 03:18:36,399
Break the darn!

1872
03:18:36,400 --> 03:18:41,400
Release the river!

1873
03:19:07,181 --> 03:19:12,181
Pippin! Hold on!

1874
03:19:15,189 --> 03:19:20,189
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1875
03:19:59,483 --> 03:20:04,483
What are you doing?

1876
03:20:10,077 --> 03:20:12,828
Where are you going?

1877
03:21:09,803 --> 03:21:13,639
It's me.

1878
03:21:13,640 --> 03:21:18,640
It's your Sam.

1879
03:21:20,188 --> 03:21:25,188
Don't you know your Sam?

1880
03:21:40,542 --> 03:21:44,795
I can't do this, Sam.

1881
03:21:44,796 --> 03:21:47,798
I know.

1882
03:21:47,799 --> 03:21:50,926
It's all wrong.

1883
03:21:50,927 --> 03:21:55,927
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1884
03:22:00,354 --> 03:22:05,354
But we are.

1885
03:22:08,862 --> 03:22:12,073
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1886
03:22:12,074 --> 03:22:15,493
The ones that really mattered.

1887
03:22:15,494 --> 03:22:18,662
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1888
03:22:18,663 --> 03:22:21,791
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

1889
03:22:21,792 --> 03:22:26,792
because how could the end be happy?

1890
03:22:27,297 --> 03:22:29,673
<i>How could the world go back
to the way it</i> was...

1891
03:22:29,674 --> 03:22:34,011
<i>when so much bad had happened?</i>

1892
03:22:34,012 --> 03:22:36,097
Victory!

1893
03:22:36,098 --> 03:22:37,807
We have victory!

1894
03:22:37,808 --> 03:22:41,936
<i>But in the end,
it's only</i> a <i>passing thing...</i>

1895
03:22:41,937 --> 03:22:43,437
<i>this shadow.</i>

1896
03:22:43,438 --> 03:22:45,981
<i>Even darkness must pass.</i>

1897
03:22:45,982 --> 03:22:48,859
<i>A new day will come.</i>

1898
03:22:48,860 --> 03:22:53,860
<i>And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.</i>

1899
03:22:54,741 --> 03:22:57,284
<i>Those were the stories
that stayed with you...</i>

1900
03:22:57,285 --> 03:22:59,203
<i>that meant something.</i>

1901
03:22:59,204 --> 03:23:03,165
<i>Even if you were too small
to understand why.</i>

1902
03:23:03,166 --> 03:23:07,169
<i>But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.</i>

1903
03:23:07,170 --> 03:23:09,588
<i>I know now.</i>

1904
03:23:09,589 --> 03:23:11,966
Folk in those stories...

1905
03:23:11,967 --> 03:23:16,262
had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1906
03:23:16,263 --> 03:23:19,181
They kept going...

1907
03:23:19,182 --> 03:23:24,019
because they were holding
on to something.

1908
03:23:24,020 --> 03:23:29,020
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1909
03:23:38,285 --> 03:23:42,496
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1910
03:23:42,497 --> 03:23:47,497
And it's worth fighting for.

1911
03:24:12,027 --> 03:24:17,027
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1912
03:24:17,073 --> 03:24:21,202
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1913
03:24:21,203 --> 03:24:26,203
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1914
03:24:27,751 --> 03:24:31,921
Then it is forfeit.

1915
03:24:31,922 --> 03:24:36,922
Release them.

1916
03:24:45,769 --> 03:24:47,978
Stay out of the forest!

1917
03:24:47,979 --> 03:24:52,979
Keep away from the trees!

1918
03:25:40,615 --> 03:25:42,575
Final count...

1919
03:25:42,576 --> 03:25:45,661
- 42.
- Forty-two?

1920
03:25:45,662 --> 03:25:50,662
Oh, that's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

1921
03:25:52,502 --> 03:25:57,502
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1922
03:26:00,302 --> 03:26:04,346
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

1923
03:26:04,347 --> 03:26:07,016
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1924
03:26:07,017 --> 03:26:12,017
because he's got my axe
embedded in his nervous system!

1925
03:26:13,940 --> 03:26:18,902
- He doesn't look happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

1926
03:26:18,903 --> 03:26:22,615
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

1927
03:26:22,616 --> 03:26:25,743
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1928
03:26:25,744 --> 03:26:30,744
I hear the staff are very good.

1929
03:26:34,252 --> 03:26:36,795
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1930
03:26:36,796 --> 03:26:41,216
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

1931
03:26:41,217 --> 03:26:42,635
I'm starving.

1932
03:26:42,636 --> 03:26:45,888
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

1933
03:26:45,889 --> 03:26:50,889
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1934
03:27:12,916 --> 03:27:17,670
Saruman's storeroom!

1935
03:27:17,671 --> 03:27:20,589
I don't believe it.

1936
03:27:20,590 --> 03:27:23,258
It can't be.

1937
03:27:23,259 --> 03:27:27,429
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

1938
03:27:27,430 --> 03:27:30,099
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1939
03:27:30,100 --> 03:27:33,394
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1940
03:27:33,395 --> 03:27:35,270
Wait.

1941
03:27:35,271 --> 03:27:36,647
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

1942
03:27:36,648 --> 03:27:40,025
Share it?

1943
03:27:40,026 --> 03:27:43,946
No. No.

1944
03:27:43,947 --> 03:27:45,698
Dead plant and all that.

1945
03:27:45,699 --> 03:27:49,118
Don't think he'd understand.

1946
03:27:49,119 --> 03:27:52,121
Could be a distant relative.

1947
03:27:52,122 --> 03:27:54,790
I get it.

1948
03:27:54,791 --> 03:27:58,711
Don't be hasty.

1949
03:27:58,712 --> 03:28:01,547
Exactly.

1950
03:28:01,548 --> 03:28:05,634
Bar-hrum.

1951
03:28:29,451 --> 03:28:30,909
This is the old sewer.

1952
03:28:30,910 --> 03:28:34,204
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1953
03:28:34,205 --> 03:28:36,999
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1954
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:40,127
Captain Faramir...

1955
03:28:40,128 --> 03:28:44,465
you have shown your quality, sir.

1956
03:28:44,466 --> 03:28:46,258
The very highest.

1957
03:28:46,259 --> 03:28:49,052
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee...

1958
03:28:49,053 --> 03:28:53,182
where gardeners are held in high honor.

1959
03:28:53,183 --> 03:28:55,768
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

1960
03:28:55,769 --> 03:28:57,519
Gollum says there's a path...

1961
03:28:57,520 --> 03:29:01,899
near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

1962
03:29:01,900 --> 03:29:06,900
Cirith Ungol?

1963
03:29:07,197 --> 03:29:09,907
- Is that its name?
- No.

1964
03:29:09,908 --> 03:29:12,409
No!

1965
03:29:12,410 --> 03:29:15,788
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1966
03:29:15,789 --> 03:29:20,209
they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1967
03:29:20,210 --> 03:29:23,086
- You cannot go that way.
<i>- It is the only way.</i>

1968
03:29:23,087 --> 03:29:28,087
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

1969
03:29:30,887 --> 03:29:35,887
I must.

1970
03:29:36,226 --> 03:29:39,978
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

1971
03:29:39,979 --> 03:29:44,979
Thank you.

1972
03:29:53,827 --> 03:29:58,827
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

1973
03:30:10,426 --> 03:30:15,426
Come on, keep up.

1974
03:30:15,431 --> 03:30:18,851
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

1975
03:30:18,852 --> 03:30:21,478
You know that, don't you?

1976
03:30:21,479 --> 03:30:23,564
He was trying to save you, see?

1977
03:30:23,565 --> 03:30:25,440
Save me?

1978
03:30:25,441 --> 03:30:27,776
So there's no hard feelings.

1979
03:30:27,777 --> 03:30:32,777
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

1980
03:30:33,074 --> 03:30:36,743
Gollum, Gollum.

1981
03:30:36,744 --> 03:30:39,580
Nice master.

1982
03:30:39,581 --> 03:30:42,583
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

1983
03:30:42,584 --> 03:30:47,584
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

1984
03:30:50,383 --> 03:30:55,383
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1985
03:31:02,729 --> 03:31:06,398
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1986
03:31:06,399 --> 03:31:11,399
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

1987
03:31:15,074 --> 03:31:19,494
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

1988
03:31:19,495 --> 03:31:24,495
<i>somewhere in the wilderness.</i>

1989
03:31:26,002 --> 03:31:29,588
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1990
03:31:29,589 --> 03:31:31,131
What?

1991
03:31:31,132 --> 03:31:35,260
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

1992
03:31:35,261 --> 03:31:38,680
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

1993
03:31:38,681 --> 03:31:41,808
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1994
03:31:41,809 --> 03:31:43,644
"Yes, my boy"

1995
03:31:43,645 --> 03:31:47,606
"The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

1996
03:31:47,607 --> 03:31:50,317
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1997
03:31:50,318 --> 03:31:52,361
"Samwise the Brave."

1998
03:31:52,362 --> 03:31:57,362
I want to hear more about Sam.

1999
03:31:59,410 --> 03:32:03,747
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

2000
03:32:03,748 --> 03:32:08,748
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

2001
03:32:08,878 --> 03:32:13,878
So was I.

2002
03:32:19,138 --> 03:32:24,138
"Samwise the Brave."

2003
03:32:26,104 --> 03:32:27,604
Sméagol?

2004
03:32:27,605 --> 03:32:30,691
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

2005
03:32:30,692 --> 03:32:32,776
Master.

2006
03:32:32,777 --> 03:32:36,530
Master looks after us.

2007
03:32:36,531 --> 03:32:39,491
Master wouldn't hurt us.

2008
03:32:39,492 --> 03:32:42,119
Master broke his promise.

2009
03:32:42,120 --> 03:32:44,454
SMEAGOL Don't ask Sméagol.

2010
03:32:44,455 --> 03:32:47,833
Poor, poor Sméagol.

2011
03:32:47,834 --> 03:32:50,836
Master betrayed us.

2012
03:32:50,837 --> 03:32:54,089
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

2013
03:32:54,090 --> 03:32:58,176
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

2014
03:32:58,177 --> 03:33:01,096
Kill him! Kill him!

2015
03:33:01,097 --> 03:33:02,764
Kill them both!

2016
03:33:02,765 --> 03:33:06,560
And then we take the precious...

2017
03:33:06,561 --> 03:33:10,772
and we be the master!

2018
03:33:10,773 --> 03:33:13,608
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

2019
03:33:13,609 --> 03:33:16,445
Eyes always watching.

2020
03:33:16,446 --> 03:33:20,157
Then we stabs them out.

2021
03:33:20,158 --> 03:33:24,828
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

2022
03:33:24,829 --> 03:33:28,457
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2023
03:33:28,458 --> 03:33:31,334
Kill them both.

2024
03:33:31,335 --> 03:33:34,004
Yes. No! No!

2025
03:33:34,005 --> 03:33:38,425
It's too risky. It's too risky.

2026
03:33:38,426 --> 03:33:41,178
Where is he? Where has he gone?

2027
03:33:41,179 --> 03:33:43,972
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Sméagol?

2028
03:33:43,973 --> 03:33:48,973
We could let her do it.

2029
03:33:50,313 --> 03:33:54,649
Yes. She could do it.

2030
03:33:54,650 --> 03:33:59,362
Yes, precious, she could.

2031
03:33:59,363 --> 03:34:04,363
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

2032
03:34:06,329 --> 03:34:08,246
Once they're dead.

2033
03:34:08,247 --> 03:34:13,247
Shh.

2034
03:34:13,586 --> 03:34:17,464
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

2035
03:34:17,465 --> 03:34:19,674
Sméagol will show you the way.

2036
03:34:19,675 --> 03:34:24,675
Follow me.
