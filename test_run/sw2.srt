1
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,870
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,190
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,830
We made it.

4
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,870
I guess I was wrong.

5
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,290
There was no danger at all.

6
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,850
Cordé.

7
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,980
Milady, I'm so sorry.

8
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,360
I've failed you, Senator.

9
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,450
No.

10
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,280
Milady, you're still in danger here.

11
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,880
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

12
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,630
You did your duty. Cordé did hers.
Now, come.

13
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,720
Senator Amidala, please.

14
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,759
Must I remind the Senator from Malastare

15
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:33,890
that negotiations are
continuing with the Separatists.

16
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,360
Peace is our objective here, not war.

17
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,870
My noble colleagues,
less than an hour ago...

18
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,370
an assassination attempt was made
against my life.

19
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,880
One of my bodyguards,
and six others,

20
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,180
were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered.

21
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,870
I was the target,
but more importantly,

22
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,070
the security measure before you
was the target.

23
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,970
I have led the opposition
to building this army,

24
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,270
but someone will stop but
nothing to assure its passage.

25
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Wake up, Senators,
you must wake up!

26
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,710
If you offer the Separatists violence,
they can only show violence in return.

27
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,860
Many will lose there lives,
all will lose their freedom.

28
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,210
I pray you do not let fear
push you into disaster.

29
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,220
Vote down the security measure,

30
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,920
which is nothing less
than a declaration of war.

31
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,140
Does anyone here want that?

32
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,540
I cannot believe they do.

33
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,290
Order! Order!

34
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,680
Due to the lateness of the hour,
and the seriousness of this motion,

35
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,290
we will take up these matters tomorrow.

36
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,090
Until then, the Senate is adjourned.

37
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,440
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

38
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,360
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

39
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,160
- If they do break away...
- I will not let this Republic

40
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,870
that has stood for a thousand years
be split in two.

41
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,210
My negotiations will not fail.

42
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,420
If they do,

43
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,840
you must realize there aren't enough
Jedi to protect the Republic.

44
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,340
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

45
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,470
Master Yoda.

46
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,390
Do you think it will really come to war?

47
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,100
The dark side clouds everything.

48
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,980
Impossible to see the future is.

49
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,570
Good.

50
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,030
Send them in.

51
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,830
We will discuss this matter later.

52
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,130
Senator Amidala,
your tragedy on the landing platform,

53
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,170
terrible.

54
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,930
Seeing you alive
brings warm feelings to my heart.

55
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,800
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

56
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,600
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

57
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,440
I think that Count Dooku was behind it.

58
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,440
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

59
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,400
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

60
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,160
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

61
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,740
But for certain, Senator,

62
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,700
in grave danger you are.

63
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,830
Master Jedi, may I suggest

64
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,050
the senator be placed
under the protection of your graces.

65
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,300
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

66
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,510
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe...

67
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,220
The situation is that serious?

68
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,560
No, but I do, Senator.

69
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,890
I realize all too well
that additional security

70
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,230
might be disruptive for you,

71
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,320
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.

72
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,490
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

73
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,700
That's possible.

74
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,570
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

75
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,910
Do it for me, milady. Please?

76
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,540
The thought of losing you...

77
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,210
Is unbearable.

78
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,340
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

79
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,800
Thank you, Master Windu.

80
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,060
You seem a little on edge.

81
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,600
Not at all.

82
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,730
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

83
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,820
You fell into
that nightmare, Master,

84
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,530
and I rescued you, remember?

85
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,320
Oh.

86
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,700
Yes.

87
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,670
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

88
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,670
I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.

89
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,100
Obi? Obi!

90
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,440
Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!

91
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,150
Good to see you again, Jar Jar.

92
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,030
Senator Padmé.

93
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,650
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

94
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,410
Desa Jedi arriven.

95
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,210
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

96
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,710
It has been far too long, Master Kenobi.

97
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,460
Ani? My goodness, you've grown.

98
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,590
So have you.
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

99
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,220
Well, for a senator, I mean.

100
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,730
Ani, you'll always be
that little boy I knew on Tatooine.

101
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,650
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

102
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,150
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

103
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,690
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

104
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,570
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

105
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,570
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

106
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,490
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

107
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,750
I want to know who's trying to kill me.

108
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,540
We are here to protect you, Senator,
not to start an investigation.

109
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,290
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

110
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,750
I promise you.

111
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,010
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

112
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,050
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

113
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,600
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin,

114
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,430
- and you will pay attention to my lead.
- Why?

115
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,890
What?

116
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,626
Why else do you think
we were assigned to her

117
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,560
if not to find the killer?

118
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,730
Protection is a job for local security,
not Jedi.

119
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,860
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

120
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,320
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

121
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,660
And you will learn your place,
young one.

122
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,170
Perhaps with merely your presence

123
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,340
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

124
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,970
Now, if you'll excuse me,

125
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,050
I will retire.

126
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,350
I know I'll feel better having you here.

127
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,076
I'll have an officer
stationed on every floor,

128
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,020
and I'll be in the
control center downstairs.

129
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,610
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

130
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,730
She hardly even recognized me,
Jar Jar.

131
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,450
I've thought about her
every day since we parted, and...

132
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,620
She's forgotten me completely.

133
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,790
Shesa happy. Happier den mesa
seein her in a longo time.

134
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,540
You're focusing on the negative,
Anakin. Be mindful of your thoughts.

135
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,460
She was pleased to see us.

136
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,000
Now, let's check the security.

137
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,640
I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.

138
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,180
We'll have to try
something more subtle this time, Zam.

139
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,350
My client is getting impatient.
Take these.

140
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,310
Be careful. They're very poisonous.

141
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,280
Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

142
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,450
Captain Typho has more
than enough men downstairs.

143
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,660
No assassin would try that way.

144
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,750
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

145
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,410
I don't like just waiting here

146
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,210
for something to happen to her.

147
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,750
What's going on?

148
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,630
She covered the cameras.

149
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,550
I don't think she liked me watching her.

150
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,090
What is she thinking?

151
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,680
She programmed R2
to warn us if there is an intruder.

152
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,390
There are many other ways
to kill a senator.

153
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,850
I know, but we also want to
catch this assassin, don't we, Master?

154
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,980
You're using her as bait.

155
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,320
It was her idea.

156
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,690
Don't worry. No harm will come to her.

157
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,200
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

158
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,910
Trust me.

159
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,540
It's too risky.

160
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,330
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

161
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,500
And yours are?

162
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,550
Possibly.

163
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,940
You look tired.

164
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,520
I don't sleep well anymore.

165
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,110
Because of your mother?

166
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,070
I don't know why
I keep dreaming about her.

167
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,910
Dreams pass in time.

168
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,830
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

169
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,840
Just being around her again
is intoxicating.

170
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

171
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,800
You've made a commitment
to the Jedi order,

172
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,050
a commitment not easily broken.

173
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,310
And don't forget, she's a politician,
and they're not to be trusted.

174
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,850
She's not like the others
in the Senate, Master.

175
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,600
It is my experience
that senators

176
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,730
focus only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns,

177
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,940
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy

178
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,780
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

179
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,370
At least not on the
economics of politics.

180
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,010
And besides, you're generalizing.

181
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,550
The chancellor
doesn't appear to be corrupt.

182
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,970
Palpatine is a politician.

183
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,390
I have observed that he is very clever

184
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,020
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

185
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,890
I think he's a good man. My...

186
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,020
I sense it too.

187
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,120
Stay here!

188
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,420
Are you all right, milady?

189
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,370
What the...

190
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,030
- What took you so long?
- You know, Master.

191
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,990
I couldn't find a speeder
that I really liked.

192
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,120
There he is.

193
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,080
With the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

194
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,186
If you spent as much time practicing
your saber techniques

195
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,040
as you do your wit, you would rival
Master Yoda as a swordsman.

196
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,540
I thought I already did.

197
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,210
Only in your mind,
my very young apprentice.

198
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,160
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

199
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,210
You know I don't like it
when you do that.

200
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,340
Sorry, Master.

201
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,920
I forgot you don't like flying.

202
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,840
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide.

203
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,250
Anakin!
How many times have I told you...

204
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,250
Stay away from power couplings!

205
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,340
That was good!

206
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,110
Where are you going?
He went that way.

207
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,320
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer,

208
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,440
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried,

209
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,450
and, personally,
I'd very much like to find out

210
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,950
who he is and who he's working for.

211
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,910
This is a shortcut. I think.

212
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,900
Well, you've lost him.

213
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,980
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

214
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,990
That was some shortcut, Anakin.

215
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,150
He went completely the other way.

216
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,820
- Once again you've proved...
- If you'll excuse me.

217
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,040
I hate it when he does that.

218
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,350
Anakin!

219
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,770
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

220
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,780
Use the Force. Think.

221
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,700
- Sorry, Master.
- He went in there to hide, not to run.

222
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,240
- Yes, Master.
- Next time, try not to lose it.

223
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,740
- Yes, Master.
- This weapon is your life.

224
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,250
I try, Master.

225
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,750
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

226
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,710
Don't say that, Master.

227
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,880
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

228
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,460
- Then why don't you listen to me?
- I am trying.

229
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,650
- Can you see him?
- I think he is a she,

230
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,570
and I think she is a changeling.

231
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,530
In that case, be extra careful.

232
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:26,200
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

233
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,660
For a drink.

234
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,800
Thank you.

235
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,630
You wanna buy some death sticks?

236
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,510
You don't want to sell me death sticks.

237
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,340
I don't want to sell you death sticks.

238
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,910
You want to go home
and rethink your life.

239
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,560
I want to go home and rethink my life.

240
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,690
Easy. Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.

241
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,660
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

242
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,290
It was a senator from Naboo.

243
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,290
And who hired you?

244
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,370
It was just a job.

245
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,590
Who hired you? Tell us.

246
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,210
Tell us now!

247
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,840
It was a bounty hunter called...

248
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:16,441
<i>Murishani... Sleemo.</i>

249
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,670
Toxic dart.

250
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,540
Track down
this bounty hunter you must, Obi-Wan.

251
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,170
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

252
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,880
What about Senator Amidala?

253
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,260
She will still need protecting.

254
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Handle that your Padawan will.

255
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,520
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

256
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,440
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

257
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,650
Travel as refugees.

258
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,150
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult

259
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,990
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

260
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,700
Until caught this killer is,

261
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,160
our judgment she must respect.

262
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,620
Anakin, go to the Senate

263
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,710
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

264
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:36,720
I will talk with her. Senator Amidala
will not refuse an executive order.

265
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,180
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

266
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,480
Thank you, Your Excellency.

267
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,690
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

268
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,860
Your patience has paid off.

269
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,530
Your guidance more than my patience.

270
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,700
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

271
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,450
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

272
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,250
Then you will be invincible.

273
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,500
I have said it many times.

274
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,340
You are the most
gifted Jedi I have ever met.

275
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,760
Thank you, Your Excellency.

276
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,550
I see you becoming
the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin,

277
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,560
even more powerful than Master Yoda.

278
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,650
I am concerned for my Padawan.

279
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,480
He is not ready to be
given this assignment on his own yet.

280
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,570
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

281
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,610
The boy has exceptional skills.

282
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,410
But he still has much to learn, Master.

283
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,950
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

284
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,080
Yes, yes.

285
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,290
A flaw more and more common
among Jedi.

286
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,830
Hmm.

287
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,800
Too sure of themselves they are.

288
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,300
Even the older, more experienced ones.

289
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,890
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true,

290
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,300
your apprentice is the only one

291
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,850
who can bring the Force
back into balance.

292
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,520
I'm taking an extended leave
of absence.

293
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,820
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the Senate.

294
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,690
- Representative Binks...
- Hmm?

295
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,820
I know I can count on you.

296
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,740
Mesa honored to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

297
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,120
Mesa accept this
with muy, muy humility and...

298
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,210
Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up.

299
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,790
I'm sure you have a great deal to do.

300
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,210
Of course. Milady.

301
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,220
I do not like this idea of hiding.

302
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,220
Don't worry.

303
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,350
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation,

304
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,060
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

305
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,230
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act

306
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,650
to not be here when its fate is decided.

307
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,690
Sometimes we must let go of our pride
and do what is requested of us.

308
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,320
Anakin, you've grown up.

309
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,830
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it.

310
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,800
Don't get me wrong.
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

311
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,680
As wise as Master Yoda
and as powerful as Master Windu.

312
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,470
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.

313
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,230
In some ways, a lot of ways,

314
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,520
I'm really ahead of him.

315
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,190
I'm ready for the trials,

316
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,900
but he feels that I'm too unpredictable.

317
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,950
He won't let me move on.

318
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,780
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

319
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,700
He's overly critical. He never listens.

320
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,910
He doesn't understand.

321
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,540
It's not fair!

322
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,550
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

323
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,630
It's the only way we grow.

324
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,970
I know.

325
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,560
Anakin.

326
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,810
Don't try to grow up too fast.

327
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,400
But I am grown up.

328
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,360
You said it yourself.

329
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,450
Please don't look at me like that.

330
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,990
- Why not?
- It makes me feel uncomfortable.

331
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,250
Sorry, milady.

332
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,060
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

333
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,230
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

334
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,640
He'll be safe with me.

335
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,940
- You'll be fine.
- It's not me, milady.

336
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,110
I worry about you. What if they realize
you've left the capital?

337
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,740
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

338
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,450
Anakin.

339
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,920
Don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

340
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,170
Yes, Master.

341
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,800
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

342
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,630
You'll be back here in no time.

343
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,010
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, Master Jedi.

344
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,930
- It's time to go.
- I know.

345
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,680
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

346
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,020
May the Force be with you, Master.

347
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,990
Suddenly I'm afraid.

348
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,870
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

349
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,750
Don't worry. We have R2 with us.

350
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,010
I do hope he doesn't try
anything foolish.

351
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,970
I'd be more concerned
about her doing something than him.

352
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,180
Place the subject for analysis
on the sensor tray, please.

353
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,980
It's a toxic dart.

354
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,100
I need to know where it
came from and who made it.

355
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,940
One moment, please.

356
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,500
Markings cannot be identified.

357
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,840
As you can see on your screen...

358
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,710
subject weapon does not exist
in any known culture.

359
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,760
Probably self-made by a warrior...

360
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,510
not associated with
any known society.

361
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,260
Stand away from
the sensor tray, please.

362
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,430
Thank you for your assistance.

363
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,360
I know who can identify this.

364
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,650
Someone to see ya, honey!

365
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,690
Jedi, by the looks of him.

366
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,070
- Obi-Wan!
- Hello, Dex.

367
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,830
Take a seat. I'll be right with ya.

368
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,710
- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

369
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,340
Hey, old buddy!

370
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,600
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

371
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,350
You can tell me what this is.

372
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,650
Well, whattaya know!

373
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,570
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'

374
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,320
on Subterrel, beyond the Outer Rim.

375
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,240
Can you tell me where it came from?
Thank you.

376
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,490
This baby belongs to them cloners.

377
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,750
What you got here
is a Kamino saberdart.

378
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,920
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

379
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,000
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

380
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,800
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

381
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,640
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect

382
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,360
for the difference
between knowledge and...

383
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,930
Wisdom.

384
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,890
Well, if droids could think, there'd be
none of us here, would there?

385
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,360
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

386
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,360
No, no. It's beyond the Outer Rim.

387
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:57,660
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

388
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,950
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

389
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:08,040
These Kaminoans keep to themselves.

390
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,340
They're cloners. Damn good ones too.

391
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:16,300
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

392
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,970
Depends on what, Dex?

393
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,850
On how good your manners are...

394
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:25,930
And how big your pocketbook is.

395
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,570
Did you call for assistance?

396
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,700
Yes, yes, I did.

397
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,680
He has a very powerful face, doesn't he?

398
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,100
He was one of the most brilliant Jedi
I've had the privilege of knowing.

399
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,850
I never understood why he quit.

400
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,850
Well, one might say
he was always a bit out of step

401
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,690
with the decisions of the council.

402
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,730
Much like your old master,
Qui-Gon Jinn.

403
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,570
Really?
Oh, yes.

404
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:01,780
They were very individual thinkers.

405
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,700
Idealists.

406
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,870
In the end, I think he left
because he lost faith

407
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,950
in the Republic.

408
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,500
He disappeared for nine of 10 years
and turned up recently...

409
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,460
as head of the Separatist movement.

410
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,500
It's very interesting.

411
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,080
I'm not sure I completely understand.

412
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,880
Well, you didn't call me over here

413
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,620
- for a history lesson.
- I did.

414
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,790
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

415
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,880
Yes, um, I'm looking for
a planetary system called Kamino.

416
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,626
- Kamino.
- It doesn't show up on the archive charts.

417
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,730
Kamino.
It's not a system I'm familiar with.

418
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,090
Are you sure you
have the right coordinates?

419
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,970
According to my information,
it should appear in this quadrant here,

420
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,220
just south of the Rishi Maze.

421
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,530
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for

422
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,150
doesn't exist.

423
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,990
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

424
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,240
If an item does not appear
in our records,

425
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,870
it does not exist.

426
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,850
Hey, you! No droids!

427
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,690
Get outta here!

428
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,450
Thank you, R2.

429
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,370
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi,

430
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,580
not being able
to visit the places you like

431
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,620
or do the things you like.

432
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,870
Or be with the people that I love.

433
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,670
Are you allowed to love?

434
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,710
I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.

435
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,720
Attachment is forbidden.

436
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,800
Possession is forbidden.

437
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:05,770
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love,

438
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,350
is central to a Jedi's life.

439
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:15,320
So you might say
that we are encouraged to love.

440
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:19,950
- You've changed so much.
- You haven't changed a bit.

441
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,910
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

442
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:39,130
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

443
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,890
Use your feelings you must.

444
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,440
Younglings. Younglings!

445
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,110
A visitor we have.

446
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,070
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

447
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,280
Hello. I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

448
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,990
What help can I be, Obi-Wan, hmm?

449
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,990
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

450
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,290
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

451
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,790
Hmm.

452
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,580
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

453
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:17,050
How embarrassing.

454
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,130
Liam, the shades.

455
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,010
Gather round the map reader.

456
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,260
Clear your minds

457
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,810
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

458
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,480
It ought to be here,

459
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,940
but it isn't.

460
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,900
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

461
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,150
Hmm.

462
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,530
Gravity's silhouette remains,

463
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,240
but the star and all the planets,

464
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,660
disappeared they have.

465
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,710
How can this be?

466
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,000
A thought?

467
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,380
- Anyone.
- Master?

468
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,420
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

469
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:09,520
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

470
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,980
The Padawan is right.

471
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,940
Go to the center of gravity's pull

472
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:21,030
and find your planet you will.

473
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:29,330
The data must have been erased.

474
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:32,540
But, Master Yoda, who could empty
information from the archives?

475
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,120
That's impossible, isn't it?

476
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,750
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

477
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,760
Only a Jedi could
have erased those files.

478
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,720
But who and why, harder to answer.

479
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,930
Meditate on this I will.

480
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,170
When I first started my training,
I was very homesick,

481
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,670
very lonely.

482
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,370
But I'd always feel better
when I thought about the Palace.

483
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,970
The way it shimmers in the sunlight...

484
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:26,920
The way the air always smells of flowers...

485
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,340
And the soft sounds
of the distant waterfalls.

486
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,960
When I first saw the Capital
I was very young.

487
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,240
And I had never seen a waterfall before.

488
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,690
I thought they were so beautiful.

489
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,420
I never dreamed that one day
I'd be living in the Palace.

490
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,250
Tell me...

491
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,440
did you dream of power and politics
when you were a little girl?

492
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,110
No, that was the last thing I thought of!

493
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,700
I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected...

494
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:59,420
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

495
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,290
Not sure I was ready.

496
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,960
The people you served thought
you did a good job.

497
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,390
I heard they even tried to amend the
Constitution so you could stay in office.

498
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:11,090
Popular rule is not democracy, Ani.

499
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,390
It gives the people what they want,
not what they need.

500
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,400
I was relieved when my two terms were up.

501
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,800
So were my parents.

502
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,550
They were very worried about me
during the blockade.

503
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,700
They couldn't wait for it all to be over.

504
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,300
Actually, I had hoped
to have a family of my own by now.

505
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:32,800
My sister has the most amazing,
wonderful kids...

506
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,350
But when the Queen asked
me to serve as Senator,

507
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,480
I couldn't refuse her.

508
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,460
I agree with her.

509
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,100
I think the Republic needs you.

510
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:46,860
I'm glad you chose to serve.

511
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,410
It appears someone doesn't want us
to know about this Kamino system.

512
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,750
Which means there's
something happening on that system...

513
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,710
that we should know about.

514
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:05,750
Master, do you think a Jedi
could have erased those files?

515
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,710
I hope not.

516
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,750
But this disturbance in the Force...

517
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,260
is making it hard
to get a sense of things.

518
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,140
I'm concerned for my Padawan.

519
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,560
He is not ready to be on his own.

520
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,560
If the prophecy is true...

521
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,860
he is the one who will
bring balance to the Force.

522
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,360
But he still has much to learn.

523
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,030
I realize now what you and
Master Yoda knew from the beginning.

524
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,440
The boy was too old
to start his training.

525
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,870
Master, we should not
have been given this assignment.

526
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:44,870
I fear Anakin will not be able
to protect the senator.

527
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,870
Why?

528
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,330
He has an emotional
connection with her.

529
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,790
It's been there since he was a boy.

530
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,830
Now he's confused...

531
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,630
distracted.

532
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:02,010
Obi-Wan, you must have faith
that he will choose the right path.

533
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,350
Yes, Master.

534
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,776
If the Senate
votes to create an army,

535
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,840
I'm sure it's going
to push us into a civil war.

536
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,180
It's unthinkable.

537
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,470
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

538
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,220
Do you see any way
through negotiations

539
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,270
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

540
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,230
Not if they feel threatened.

541
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,440
My guess is they'll turn
to the Trade Federations

542
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,940
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

543
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,360
It's outrageous, but after four trials
in the Supreme Court,

544
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,360
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

545
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:09,490
I fear the Senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

546
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,830
We must keep our faith in the Republic.

547
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,800
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

548
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,260
Let's pray that day never comes.

549
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,260
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

550
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,390
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?

551
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,350
Oh, Anakin's not a Jedi yet.

552
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:37,480
He's still a Padawan learner.
But I was thinking...

553
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,190
- Hold on a minute.
- Excuse me.

554
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,610
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

555
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,820
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

556
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,490
Excuse me.
I'm in charge of security here, milady.

557
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,620
And this is my home.
I know it very well.

558
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,080
That is why we're here.

559
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,830
I think it would be wise

560
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:56,790
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

561
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:59,880
Sorry, milady.

562
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,300
Perfect. It's settled, then.

563
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,500
We're here.

564
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,620
This is my house.

565
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,380
Ryoo!

566
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,660
Pooja!

567
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,660
Padmé!

568
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,820
I was worried.

569
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,660
Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.

570
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,340
- Hello, Anakin.
- Hello.

571
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,300
- This is my mother.
- Hello.

572
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,900
You made it just in time for dinner.
I hope you're hungry, Anakin.

573
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,820
- A little.
- He's being polite, Mom. We're starving.

574
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,660
Well, you've come
to the right place at the right time.

575
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,980
Honey, it's so good
to see you safe. We were so worried.

576
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,620
- Dear.
- I know, I know.

577
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,580
But I had to say it. Now it's done.

578
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,300
Did you know, Anakin,
you're the first boyfriend

579
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,620
my sister's ever brought home?

580
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,300
He's not my boyfriend.

581
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:28,100
Anakin's a friend.
We've known each other for years.

582
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,980
He's a Jedi assigned to me
by the senate to protect me.

583
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,580
A bodyguard. Oh, Padmé.

584
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,060
- They didn't tell us it was that serious.
- It's not. I promise.

585
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,300
I'm not in any danger, Mom.

586
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,540
- Is she?
- Yes, um...

587
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,420
I'm afraid she is.

588
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,560
Ah, I sometimes wish
that, uh, I traveled more,

589
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,040
but, uh, I must say,
I'm very happy here.

590
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,680
Padmé tells me
you teach at the university.

591
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,080
Yeah, yeah.
Before that, I was a builder.

592
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,680
I also worked for a, uh-

593
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,280
a freedom relief movement,
but I was very young.

594
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,420
Why haven't you told us about him?

595
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,760
What's there
to talk about? He's just a boy.

596
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,160
A boy?

597
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,696
Have you seen the way he looks at you?

598
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,240
Sola, stop it.

599
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,640
It's obvious
he has feelings for you.

600
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,280
Anakin and I are friends.

601
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,760
Our relationship
is strictly professional.

602
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,080
So tell me, son,
how serious is this thing?

603
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,080
How much danger
is my daughter really in?

604
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,480
There have been two attempts
on her life.

605
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,320
Chances are there'll be more.

606
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,736
My master's tracking
down the assassins.

607
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,400
I'm sure he'll find out who they are.

608
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,520
The situation won't last long.

609
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,960
I don't want anything
to happen to her.

610
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,240
I don't either.

611
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,700
So you still live at home.

612
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,100
I move around so much,
never had a place of my own.

613
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,700
Official Residences have no
warmth. I feel good here, I feel at home.

614
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,200
Never really had a home...

615
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,700
Home was always where my mom was.

616
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,200
Is this you?

617
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,200
That was when I worked
with the relief group.

618
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,200
Their sun was imploding
and the planet was dying...

619
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,700
I was helping to relocate all the children.

620
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,200
See that little one I'm holding? His name
is N'a-kee-tula, which means sweetheart.

621
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,700
He was so full of life. They all were.

622
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,700
They were never able to adapt
to live off their native planet.

623
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,900
They all died.

624
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,200
My first day as an Apprentice legislator.

625
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,700
Notice the difference?

626
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,930
There it is, R4,
right where it should be.

627
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:33,560
Our missing planet Kamino.

628
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,640
Master Jedi.

629
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:17,060
The prime minister is expecting you.

630
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:20,810
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

631
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,070
He is anxious to meet you.

632
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,190
After all these years,

633
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,570
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

634
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,160
Now, please, this way.

635
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,340
May I present Lama Su,

636
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,930
prime minister of Kamino.

637
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,600
And this is Master Jedi...

638
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,640
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

639
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,980
I trust you're going to enjoy your stay.

640
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:01,980
Please.

641
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,190
And now to business.

642
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:10,240
You will be delighted
to hear that we are on schedule.

643
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,330
200,000 units are ready,

644
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:15,950
with a million more well on the way.

645
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:19,040
That's good news.

646
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:22,040
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas

647
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,500
that his order will be met on time.

648
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,710
I'm sorry. Master...

649
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:33,180
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still
a leading member of the Jedi Council,

650
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:34,720
is he not?

651
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,600
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

652
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:42,600
Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that.

653
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:47,070
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

654
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,320
- The army?
- Yes.

655
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:55,490
A clone army, and I must say,
one of the finest we've ever created.

656
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:57,200
Tell me, Prime Minister,

657
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,120
when my master first
contacted you about the army,

658
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,370
did he say who it was for?

659
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,170
Of course he did.

660
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,250
This army is for the Republic.

661
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:12,340
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

662
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,350
That's why I'm here.

663
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,450
We used to come here
for school retreat.

664
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,500
We would swim to that island every day.

665
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:45,380
I love the water.

666
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:54,130
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us

667
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:57,260
and try to guess
the names of the birds singing.

668
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,270
I don't like sand.

669
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,650
It's coarse and rough and irritating,

670
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:08,730
and it gets everywhere.

671
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,200
Not like here.

672
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,110
Here, everything is soft...

673
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:19,490
And smooth.

674
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,320
No.

675
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,120
I shouldn't have done that.

676
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,580
I'm sorry.

677
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:22,310
- Very impressive.
- I'd hoped you would be pleased.

678
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:27,690
Clones can think creatively.

679
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:32,270
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

680
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:40,870
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.

681
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:44,700
This group was created
about five years ago.

682
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,870
You mentioned
growth acceleration.

683
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:48,540
Oh, yes, it's essential.

684
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,960
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

685
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,630
Now we can do it in half the time.

686
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,420
I see.

687
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:59,430
They are totally obedient,

688
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:02,220
taking any order without question.

689
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,390
We modified their genetic structure

690
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:07,850
to make them less independent
than the original host.

691
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:10,350
And who was the original host?

692
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,650
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

693
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,190
And where is this bounty hunter now?

694
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:18,860
Oh, we keep him here.

695
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:24,030
Apart from his pay,
which is considerable,

696
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,370
Fett demanded only one thing,

697
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:29,290
an unaltered clone for himself.

698
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:31,830
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

699
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,460
Pure genetic replication.

700
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,510
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile

701
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:40,590
and no growth acceleration.

702
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:43,550
I should very much
like to meet this Jango Fett.

703
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,430
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

704
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:08,200
Magnificent, aren't they?

705
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:16,380
I don't know.

706
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,630
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

707
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:21,340
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

708
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,590
They only work on the weak-minded.

709
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:28,100
All right. I was 12.

710
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,520
His name was Palo. We were both
in the Legislative Youth Program.

711
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,440
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

712
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,190
Dark, curly hair. Dreamy eyes.

713
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:39,610
All right, I get the picture.

714
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,530
Whatever happened to him?

715
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:44,570
I went into public service,
he went on to become an artist.

716
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,570
Maybe he was the smart one.

717
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,620
You really don't like politicians,
do you?

718
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,120
I like two or three,

719
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,290
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

720
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,500
I don't think the system works.

721
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:02,380
How would you have it work?

722
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:06,970
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem,

723
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:11,350
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people, and then do it.

724
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:12,930
That's exactly what we do.

725
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,480
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

726
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,560
Well, then they should be made to.

727
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,480
By whom? Who's gonna make them?

728
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,570
- I don't know. Someone.
- You?

729
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,200
- Of course not me.
- But someone.

730
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,030
Someone wise.

731
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:29,910
Sounds an awful lot
like a dictatorship to me.

732
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,910
Well, if it works.

733
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,510
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

734
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:45,470
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

735
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,240
Whoa.

736
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:26,720
Ani! Ani, are you all right?

737
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:06,210
Boba, is your father here?

738
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:08,300
Yep.

739
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,470
May we see him?

740
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:12,390
Sure.

741
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,600
Dad, Taun We's here.

742
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:32,620
Jango, welcome back.

743
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,870
Was your trip productive?

744
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:37,040
Fairly.

745
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,620
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

746
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:43,960
He's come to check on our progress.

747
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,090
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

748
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:50,260
I'm just a simple man
trying to make my way in the universe.

749
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:54,010
Ever made your way
as far into the interior as Coruscant?

750
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,970
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

751
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,690
Possibly.

752
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:03,440
Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas.

753
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,360
Master who?

754
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:16,490
Sifo-Dyas.

755
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:19,250
Is he not the Jedi
who hired you for this job?

756
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:23,880
Never heard of him.

757
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:28,630
Really?

758
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:32,970
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

759
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,800
Curious.

760
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,890
Do you like your army?

761
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,770
I look forward to seeing them in action.

762
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:48,570
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

763
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,490
Thank you for your time, Jango.

764
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,610
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

765
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,720
What is it, Dad?

766
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,760
Pack your things. We're leaving.

767
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,650
And when I got to them, we went into
aggressive negotiations. Thank you.

768
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:31,320
"Aggressive negotiations"?
What's that?

769
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,490
Well, negotiations with a lightsaber.

770
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:51,130
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

771
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:22,950
From the moment I met you,

772
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:25,830
all those years ago,

773
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:29,210
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

774
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:34,670
And now that I'm with you again,

775
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:36,800
I'm in agony.

776
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:43,810
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.

777
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:46,850
The thought of not being with you,

778
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,900
I can't breathe.

779
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:58,860
I'm haunted by the kiss
that you should never have given me.

780
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:01,070
My heart is beating,

781
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:04,290
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

782
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,920
You are in my very soul,

783
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,080
tormenting me.

784
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:17,760
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

785
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:31,850
If you are suffering as much as I am,
please, tell me.

786
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,980
I can't.

787
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:39,780
We can't. It's just not possible.

788
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:42,910
Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.

789
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,330
No, you listen.

790
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:49,500
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

791
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:53,000
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.

792
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:57,630
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion,

793
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:00,930
it'll take us to a place we cannot go,

794
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:03,680
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

795
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:05,720
Then you do feel something.

796
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:08,810
I will not let you
give up your future for me.

797
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:11,140
You are asking me to be rational.

798
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:14,610
That is something I know I cannot do.

799
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:19,320
Believe me, I wish that I could just
wish away my feelings,

800
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,280
but I can't.

801
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:25,120
I will not give in to this.

802
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,080
Well, you know, it...

803
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:37,250
Wouldn't have to be that way.

804
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,380
We could keep it a secret.

805
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,760
We'd be living a lie,

806
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,930
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

807
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,180
I couldn't do that.

808
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:52,520
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

809
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:57,940
No. You're right.

810
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:01,240
It would destroy us.

811
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:12,290
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

812
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:16,000
And remind them,
if they need more troops,

813
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:19,000
it will take more time to grow them.

814
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:21,880
- I won't forget, and thank you.
- Thank you.

815
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:41,070
R4!

816
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:44,820
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

817
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,790
<i>I have successfully made contact</i>

818
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:54,460
<i>with the prime minister of Kamino.</i>

819
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:57,210
<i>They are using a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett</i>

820
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,630
<i>to create a clone army.</i>

821
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,050
<i>I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter</i>

822
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:03,510
<i>is the assassin we are looking for.</i>

823
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:05,070
Do you think these cloners are involved

824
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:07,720
in the plot to
assassinate Senator Amidala?

825
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,680
<i>No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.</i>

826
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:13,770
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

827
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:16,640
Clear your mind must be

828
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:21,110
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

829
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:22,780
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

830
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:26,200
<i>They say Master Sifo-Dyas
placed an order for a clone army</i>

831
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,070
<i>at the request of the Senate
almost ten years ago.</i>

832
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:35,660
<i>I was under the impression
he was killed before that.</i>

833
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,170
<i>Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?</i>

834
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:41,170
No. Whoever placed that order

835
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:43,590
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

836
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:48,050
Bring him here. Question him we will.

837
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:51,970
<i>Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.</i>

838
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:57,180
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army

839
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:59,150
we could not see.

840
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,400
I think it is time
we informed the Senate

841
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,860
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

842
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:11,990
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

843
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:14,080
If informed the Senate is,

844
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,950
multiply our adversaries will.

845
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:20,920
No.

846
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,250
- No.
<i>- Anakin! Help me!</i>

847
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:24,590
Mom, no.

848
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:27,630
<i>- Anakin!</i>
- Don't.

849
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:30,220
No.

850
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:34,510
No.

851
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,450
Don't go.

852
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,750
I don't want to disturb you.

853
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,830
Your presence is soothing.

854
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:08,880
You had another nightmare last night.

855
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,470
Jedi don't have nightmares.

856
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:14,600
I heard you.

857
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,060
I saw my mother.

858
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,110
She is suffering, Padmé.

859
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,570
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

860
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,790
She is in pain.

861
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:51,010
I know I'm disobeying
my mandate to protect you, Senator,

862
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:53,630
but I have to go.

863
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:57,970
I have to help her.

864
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,600
I'll go with you.

865
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:04,400
I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.

866
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,990
Dad, look!

867
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:19,990
Boba, get on board!

868
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,070
Oh, not good.

869
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,500
- Wait right there.
- Okey-okey.

870
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,360
Ani?

871
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:25,610
Little Ani?

872
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,450
Ah...

873
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:36,420
You are Ani! It is you!

874
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:40,550
You sure sprouted, huh?

875
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:44,590
A Jedi! Whattaya know!

876
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:50,310
Hey, maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

877
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:52,020
My mother.

878
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,560
Oh, yeah. Shmi. Uh...

879
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:59,400
She's not mine-a no more-a. I sold her.

880
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,610
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

881
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:05,610
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business, huh?

882
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:09,490
Yeah, I sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars.

883
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:11,910
At least I think it was Lars.

884
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:15,500
Believe it or not,
I heard he freed her and married her!

885
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:19,040
Can ya beat that? Yeah.

886
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:22,420
Do you know where they are now?

887
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:25,420
Long way from here.

888
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:30,140
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

889
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:32,310
I'd like to know.

890
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:36,520
Sure. Absolutely!

891
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,770
Let's go look at my records, huh?

892
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,260
Dad! I think we're being tracked!

893
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:14,770
He must have put a homing device
on our hull.

894
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:17,100
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field,

895
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,400
and we'll have a couple
of surprises for him.

896
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:34,740
Seismic charges! Stand by.

897
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:02,560
He doesn't seem to take a hint,
this guy.

898
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:22,580
Watch out!

899
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:44,810
Get him, Dad! Get him! Fire!

900
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:49,440
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

901
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:13,050
- We got him!
- We'll just have to finish him.

902
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:42,500
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

903
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:47,920
Fire them now!

904
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:03,850
Well, we won't be seeing him again.

905
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:40,430
Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.

906
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,830
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

907
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:42,780
Stay with the ship, R2.

908
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:57,010
Oh.

909
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,640
Hello. How might I be of service?
I am C...

910
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,260
3PO?

911
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:07,390
The maker!

912
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:10,520
Master Ani! I knew you would return.

913
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,020
I knew it! And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

914
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,480
Hello, 3PO.

915
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:19,570
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

916
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:21,450
I've come to see my mother.

917
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:23,200
Oh.

918
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:26,030
I think perhaps we'd better go indoors.

919
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:33,000
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

920
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,340
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

921
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,010
Owen Lars. This is my girlfriend, Beru.

922
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:42,930
- Hello.
- I'm Padmé.

923
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:45,260
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

924
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:48,270
I had a feeling you
might show up someday.

925
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:52,850
- Is my mother here?
- No, she's not.

926
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:56,900
Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife.

927
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:02,030
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

928
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:12,710
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

929
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:16,590
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

930
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:19,670
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did,

931
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:23,260
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.

932
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:28,010
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home

933
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:29,220
when they took her.

934
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,850
Those Tuskens walk like men,

935
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:37,730
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

936
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:42,570
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

937
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:47,700
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg,

938
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:53,330
I just couldn't ride
anymore until I heal.

939
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,170
I don't want to give up on her,

940
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:59,090
but she's been gone a month.

941
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:03,300
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

942
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:09,140
Where are you going?

943
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:11,260
To find my mother.

944
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:16,060
Your mother's dead, son. Accept it.

945
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:39,960
You're gonna have to stay here.

946
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:44,050
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

947
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:45,300
Anakin...

948
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:58,140
I won't be long.

949
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:49,210
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild

950
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:51,550
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

951
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,180
What about the senator
from Naboo?

952
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:57,720
Is she dead yet?

953
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:01,560
I am not signing your treaty until
I have her head on my desk.

954
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,230
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

955
01:27:04,270 --> 01:27:07,520
With these new battle droids
we've built for you,

956
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:10,820
you'll have the finest
army in the galaxy.

957
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:23,080
As I explained to you earlier,

958
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:27,090
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems

959
01:27:27,130 --> 01:27:29,500
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

960
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:39,760
The Techno Union army...

961
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:42,270
is at your disposal, Count.

962
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:46,860
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

963
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,650
Good. Very good.

964
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:53,240
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support,

965
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,160
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours,

966
01:27:56,200 --> 01:28:00,120
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

967
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:04,080
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

968
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:08,330
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

969
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:08,600
Mom.

970
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:10,730
Mom? Mom?

971
01:29:12,730 --> 01:29:14,780
Ani?

972
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:20,660
Ani? Is it you?

973
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,990
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

974
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,870
Ani?

975
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:30,670
Ani?

976
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,130
You look so handsome.

977
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:39,630
My son.

978
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:42,970
My grown-up son.

979
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:46,350
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

980
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,730
I missed you.

981
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:53,310
Now I am complete.

982
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:02,370
I love y...

983
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,290
Stay with me, Mom. Everything...

984
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:08,500
I love...

985
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:12,710
I... I love...

986
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:14,440
<i>Anakin! Anakin! No!</i>

987
01:31:34,670 --> 01:31:35,920
What is it?

988
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:40,590
Pain, suffering,

989
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:43,050
death I feel.

990
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:51,310
Something terrible has happened.

991
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:58,150
Young Skywalker is in pain.
Terrible pain.

992
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:06,450
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

993
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:09,530
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

994
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:13,290
We'll have to try something else.

995
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:20,880
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo. It's much closer.

996
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,130
Anakin? Anakin, do you copy?

997
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:28,180
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

998
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:30,560
He's not on Naboo, R4.

999
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,680
I'm going to try and widen the range.

1000
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:39,610
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

1001
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:49,070
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right,

1002
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:53,080
but it's coming from Tatooine.

1003
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,580
What in the blazes is he doing there?

1004
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,620
I told him to stay on Naboo.

1005
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:02,800
We haven't got much time.

1006
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:05,340
Anakin? Anakin, do you copy?

1007
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:07,510
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1008
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,350
<i>Retransmit this message...</i>

1009
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:22,060
<i>Anakin, do you copy? Anakin...</i>

1010
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,400
<i>My long-range has been knocked out.</i>

1011
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:26,740
<i>Retransmit this message to Coruscant.</i>

1012
01:34:11,070 --> 01:34:13,620
I brought you something.

1013
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:15,830
Are you hungry?

1014
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:19,410
The shifter broke.

1015
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:24,710
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

1016
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:30,260
I'm good at fixing things. Always was.

1017
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:34,550
But I couldn't...

1018
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:40,560
Why'd she have to die?

1019
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,650
Why couldn't I save her?

1020
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:47,820
I know I could have!

1021
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:53,530
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

1022
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:57,950
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

1023
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:02,670
Someday I will be.

1024
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:05,790
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever!

1025
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:09,050
I promise you.

1026
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,430
I will even learn to
stop people from dying.

1027
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:14,640
Anakin.

1028
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:18,680
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!

1029
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,810
He's jealous! He's holding me back!

1030
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:28,770
What's wrong, Ani?

1031
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:36,070
I...

1032
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:41,500
I killed them.

1033
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:44,870
I killed them all.

1034
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,880
They're dead.

1035
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,340
Every single one of them.

1036
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,090
And not just the men,

1037
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,060
but the women

1038
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:01,180
and the children too.

1039
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:06,850
They're like animals,
and I slaughtered them like animals!

1040
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:10,230
I hate them!

1041
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,040
To be angry is to be human.

1042
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,840
I'm a Jedi.

1043
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,090
I know I'm better than this.

1044
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:53,690
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

1045
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:58,780
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

1046
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:03,870
Good-bye, my darling wife.

1047
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,830
And thank you.

1048
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:39,910
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.

1049
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,910
I wasn't strong enough.

1050
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:52,000
But I promise I won't fail again.

1051
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:04,760
I miss you...

1052
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,810
So much.

1053
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:17,650
R2? What are you doing here?

1054
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:24,740
It seems that he is carrying a message
from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1055
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:29,040
Master Ani,
does that name mean anything to you?

1056
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,710
<i>Anakin, my long-range
transmitter has been knocked out.</i>

1057
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:36,050
<i>Retransmit this message to Coruscant.</i>

1058
01:38:40,090 --> 01:38:42,430
<i>I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett,</i>

1059
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:44,930
<i>to the droid foundries on Geonosis.</i>

1060
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:48,310
<i>The Trade Federation is to take
delivery of a droid army here,</i>

1061
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:50,730
<i>and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray</i>

1062
01:38:50,770 --> 01:38:54,270
<i>is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.</i>

1063
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:56,190
<i>The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance</i>

1064
01:38:56,230 --> 01:38:59,940
<i>have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming a...</i>

1065
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:02,280
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

1066
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:17,920
More happening on Geonosis,
I feel, than has been revealed.

1067
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,920
I agree.

1068
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:23,130
Anakin, we will deal with Count Dooku.

1069
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:27,140
<i>The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.</i>

1070
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:29,890
<i>Protect the senator at all costs.</i>

1071
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:33,100
<i>That is your first priority.</i>

1072
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:36,020
Understood, Master.

1073
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:37,586
They'll never get there in time
to save him.

1074
01:39:37,610 --> 01:39:41,490
They have to come
halfway across the galaxy. Look.

1075
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,820
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

1076
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:48,160
If he's still alive.

1077
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:52,000
Ani, are you just
gonna sit here and let him die?

1078
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,660
He's your friend, your mentor. He's...

1079
01:39:53,710 --> 01:39:54,920
He's like my father!

1080
01:39:56,040 --> 01:40:00,000
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here!

1081
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:03,050
He gave you strict orders to protect me,

1082
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:05,680
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

1083
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:10,220
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

1084
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:18,020
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

1085
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:29,470
The Commerce Guilds
are preparing for war.

1086
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:30,830
There can be no doubt of that.

1087
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:32,790
Count Dooku
must have made a treaty with them.

1088
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:42,500
Unfortunately, the debate is not over.

1089
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:46,930
The Senate will never approve the use
of clones before the separatists attack.

1090
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:48,720
This is a crisis.

1091
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:51,810
The Senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

1092
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:55,640
He can then approve
the creation of an army.

1093
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,020
But what senator
would have the courage

1094
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:00,610
to propose such a radical amendment?

1095
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:05,190
If only Senator Amidala were here.

1096
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,530
Hmm.

1097
01:41:26,050 --> 01:41:27,680
Traitor.

1098
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:31,930
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

1099
01:41:31,970 --> 01:41:34,010
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

1100
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:36,640
I thought you were the leader here,
Dooku.

1101
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:39,350
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

1102
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:42,860
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

1103
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:46,530
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

1104
01:41:47,070 --> 01:41:50,570
May I ask why a Jedi knight

1105
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:53,030
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

1106
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:56,040
I've been tracking
a bounty hunter named Jango Fett.

1107
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,660
Do you know him?

1108
01:41:57,710 --> 01:42:00,670
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

1109
01:42:00,710 --> 01:42:02,500
The Geonosians don't trust them.

1110
01:42:02,540 --> 01:42:05,800
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

1111
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:11,340
It's a great pity that our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

1112
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:14,600
Qui-Gon always
spoke very highly of you.

1113
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:21,350
I wish he were still alive.

1114
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:25,190
I could use his help right now.

1115
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:28,070
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

1116
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:33,030
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

1117
01:42:33,070 --> 01:42:36,160
You forget that he was once
my apprentice,

1118
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:38,450
just as you were once his.

1119
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,170
He knew all about
the corruption in the Senate,

1120
01:42:41,210 --> 01:42:42,730
but he would never
have gone along with it

1121
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:44,500
if he had learned the truth as I have.

1122
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:47,300
- The truth?
- The truth.

1123
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:55,180
What if I told you that the Republic

1124
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:58,810
was now under the control
of the dark lord of the Sith?

1125
01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:02,190
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

1126
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:07,270
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

1127
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:10,190
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence

1128
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:14,660
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

1129
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:17,620
I don't believe you.

1130
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:19,750
The viceroy of the Trade Federation

1131
01:43:19,790 --> 01:43:24,250
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious,

1132
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:28,210
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

1133
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:31,340
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

1134
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:35,890
You must join me, Obi-Wan,

1135
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:40,640
and together we will destroy the Sith!

1136
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:44,810
I will never join you, Dooku.

1137
01:43:54,030 --> 01:43:57,120
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

1138
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:07,880
It's-a clear
desa separatists made a pact

1139
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:10,250
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

1140
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:14,680
Senators, dellow felagates...

1141
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:19,260
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic,

1142
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:23,020
mesa propose that the Senate

1143
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:26,350
give immediately emergency powers

1144
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:29,400
to the supreme chancellor.

1145
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:35,650
Palpatine! Palpatine! Palpatine!

1146
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:42,200
Order! We shall have order!

1147
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:46,710
It is with great reluctance

1148
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:49,290
that I have agreed to this calling.

1149
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:54,510
I love democracy. I love the Republic.

1150
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:57,630
The power you give me,

1151
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:02,350
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

1152
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:11,360
And as my first act
with this new authority,

1153
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:16,110
I will create a grand army
of the Republic

1154
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:20,620
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

1155
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,870
- It is done, then.
- Hmm.

1156
01:45:28,290 --> 01:45:32,250
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1157
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:37,260
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino,

1158
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:41,180
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

1159
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,530
See those columns
of steam straight ahead?

1160
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:05,660
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1161
01:46:06,330 --> 01:46:07,960
That'll do.

1162
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:21,090
Look, whatever happens out there,
follow my lead.

1163
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:23,390
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

1164
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:24,560
As a member of the Senate,

1165
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:27,470
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1166
01:46:28,350 --> 01:46:32,400
Don't worry.
I've given up trying to argue with you.

1167
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:41,030
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help,

1168
01:46:41,070 --> 01:46:43,120
they would have asked for it.

1169
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:46,450
You obviously have a great deal to learn
about human behavior.

1170
01:47:12,230 --> 01:47:13,270
For a mechanic,

1171
01:47:13,310 --> 01:47:15,440
you seem to do an excessive
amount of thinking.

1172
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:20,110
I am programmed
to understand humans!

1173
01:47:23,610 --> 01:47:25,410
"What does that mean?"

1174
01:47:25,450 --> 01:47:28,410
That means I am in charge here!

1175
01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:31,500
Where are you going now?
You don't know what's out there.

1176
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:35,080
Have you no sense at all? Idiot!

1177
01:47:37,710 --> 01:47:39,460
Please wait.

1178
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:42,300
Do you know where you're going?

1179
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:56,310
Wait.

1180
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:07,030
Oh, my...

1181
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:19,170
Padmé!

1182
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:15,730
Oh, my goodness! Shut me down!

1183
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:18,560
Machines making machines.

1184
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:20,860
How perverse. Oh!

1185
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:25,280
Calm down, R2. I almost fell.

1186
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:27,200
You'll get your chance...

1187
01:49:29,570 --> 01:49:31,160
I'm scrap.

1188
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:34,540
It's a nightmare!

1189
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:38,500
I want to go home!

1190
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:42,000
What did I do to deserve this?

1191
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:24,130
I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.

1192
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:26,550
He's always getting
himself into trouble.

1193
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:29,550
Oh, no!

1194
01:50:39,350 --> 01:50:40,390
Uh-oh.

1195
01:50:44,690 --> 01:50:46,360
I'm so confused.

1196
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:43,680
Not again.

1197
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,270
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1198
01:52:55,150 --> 01:52:58,370
Don't move, Jedi! Take him away.

1199
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:25,970
You're holding a Jedi knight...
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1200
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:28,970
I'm formally requesting
you hand him over to me now.

1201
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:32,960
We don't recognize
the Republic here, Senator.

1202
01:53:32,970 --> 01:53:36,960
But if Naboo were to
join our alliance...

1203
01:53:36,970 --> 01:53:40,960
I could easily hear
your plea for clemency.

1204
01:53:41,970 --> 01:53:43,960
And if I don't join your rebellion?

1205
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:45,980
The Republic...

1206
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:48,990
cannot be fixed, milady.

1207
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:52,900
It is time to start over.

1208
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:54,990
I know of your treaties with the
Trade Federation,

1209
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:57,540
the Commerce Guilds
and the others, Count.

1210
01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:59,980
I will not forsake
all I have honored and worked for...

1211
01:53:59,990 --> 01:54:01,980
and betray the Republic.

1212
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:03,990
Without your cooperation...

1213
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:06,940
I've done all I can for you.

1214
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:19,200
You're committing an act of war, Archduke.

1215
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:21,460
I hope you're prepared
for the consequences.

1216
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,200
Get on with it! Carry out the sentence...

1217
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:33,200
I want to see her suffer.

1218
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,790
Don't be afraid.

1219
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:55,540
I'm not afraid to die.

1220
01:55:00,210 --> 01:55:04,420
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1221
01:55:05,970 --> 01:55:08,180
What are you talking about?

1222
01:55:09,390 --> 01:55:11,930
I love you.

1223
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:17,560
You love me?

1224
01:55:22,070 --> 01:55:25,400
I thought that we had decided
not to fall in love,

1225
01:55:27,110 --> 01:55:30,910
that we would be forced to live a lie

1226
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:34,080
and that it would destroy our lives.

1227
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:37,750
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1228
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,630
I truly,

1229
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:47,970
deeply love you,

1230
01:55:49,010 --> 01:55:52,180
and before we die, I want you to know.

1231
01:56:48,690 --> 01:56:51,200
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1232
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:54,870
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1233
01:56:56,490 --> 01:56:58,450
Then we decided to come
and rescue you.

1234
01:56:59,870 --> 01:57:01,170
Good job.

1235
01:57:57,100 --> 01:57:59,850
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1236
01:58:25,420 --> 01:58:27,710
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1237
01:58:28,090 --> 01:58:30,050
She seems to be on top of things.

1238
01:59:33,230 --> 01:59:36,780
She can't do that!
Shoot her or something!

1239
02:00:56,150 --> 02:00:57,230
Jump!

1240
02:01:02,820 --> 02:01:03,870
Hyah!

1241
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:26,680
This isn't how it's supposed to be!
Jango! Finish her off!

1242
02:01:26,890 --> 02:01:31,190
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

1243
02:02:00,630 --> 02:02:04,760
Master Windu,
how pleasant of you to join us.

1244
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,720
This party's over.

1245
02:02:20,690 --> 02:02:25,410
Brave but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1246
02:02:25,450 --> 02:02:29,580
- You're impossibly outnumbered.
- I don't think so.

1247
02:02:29,950 --> 02:02:31,040
We'll see.

1248
02:03:09,580 --> 02:03:12,370
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1249
02:03:51,700 --> 02:03:54,540
What's all this noise? A battle!

1250
02:03:54,700 --> 02:03:56,750
There's been some terrible mistake!

1251
02:03:56,790 --> 02:03:59,630
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

1252
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:30,840
Die, Jedi dogs! What did I say?

1253
02:05:40,390 --> 02:05:43,350
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1254
02:05:49,030 --> 02:05:51,900
Excuse me. I'm trapped. I can't get up.

1255
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:07,630
You call this a diplomatic solution?

1256
02:06:07,670 --> 02:06:09,880
No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1257
02:06:14,890 --> 02:06:15,930
Uh-oh.

1258
02:06:15,970 --> 02:06:17,140
Roger, roger.

1259
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:37,490
R2, what are you doing here?

1260
02:06:40,790 --> 02:06:43,250
What are you doing? Stop that!

1261
02:06:43,290 --> 02:06:46,040
You're going to strain something.
My neck!

1262
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:51,920
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag.

1263
02:06:57,550 --> 02:06:58,890
I'm quite beside myself.

1264
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:10,940
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1265
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:15,030
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1266
02:07:37,630 --> 02:07:41,640
Master Windu,
you have fought gallantly,

1267
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:47,980
worthy of recognition
in the archives of the Jedi order.

1268
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:52,320
Now it is finished.

1269
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:58,360
Surrender,
and your lives will be spared.

1270
02:07:58,860 --> 02:08:02,830
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

1271
02:08:02,870 --> 02:08:07,080
Then, I'm sorry, old friend.

1272
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:20,140
Look!

1273
02:08:30,730 --> 02:08:35,150
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.

1274
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:34,750
I've had the most peculiar dream.

1275
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:47,220
If Dooku escapes,

1276
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:51,060
rally more systems to his cause he will.

1277
02:09:55,810 --> 02:09:57,150
Hold on!

1278
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:04,200
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1279
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,290
Good call, my young Padawan.

1280
02:10:26,640 --> 02:10:29,100
The Jedi have
amassed a huge army.

1281
02:10:29,390 --> 02:10:31,270
That doesn't seem possible.

1282
02:10:31,310 --> 02:10:33,980
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1283
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:38,110
We must send
all available droids into battle.

1284
02:10:38,150 --> 02:10:39,440
There are too many.

1285
02:10:51,330 --> 02:10:54,410
- Pilot, land in that assembly area!
- Yes, sir.

1286
02:11:04,130 --> 02:11:07,970
Sir, I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1287
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:12,930
To the forward
command center take me.

1288
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:38,330
Attack those Federation starships!
Quickly!

1289
02:11:49,390 --> 02:11:53,220
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1290
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:57,690
Very good. Very good.

1291
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:27,800
This is not looking good at all!

1292
02:12:29,220 --> 02:12:32,550
We must get the starships
back into space.

1293
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:41,400
My master will never allow the Republic

1294
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:42,810
to get away with this treachery.

1295
02:13:02,380 --> 02:13:04,790
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

1296
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:09,340
They will be much safer there
with my master.

1297
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:07,690
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1298
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,650
Yes, sir.

1299
02:14:10,490 --> 02:14:13,280
Move all quadrants to sector 5-1-5.

1300
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:55,280
Look over there!

1301
02:14:58,660 --> 02:15:00,950
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1302
02:15:01,490 --> 02:15:03,160
We're out of rockets, sir.

1303
02:15:03,330 --> 02:15:06,080
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1304
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:10,090
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1305
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:30,570
Padmé!

1306
02:15:33,990 --> 02:15:36,400
- Put the ship down!
- Anakin!

1307
02:15:36,450 --> 02:15:40,280
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way! Follow that speeder!

1308
02:15:46,290 --> 02:15:48,460
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1309
02:15:48,500 --> 02:15:52,250
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1310
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:55,380
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1311
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:57,680
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!

1312
02:15:57,720 --> 02:16:00,640
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1313
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:03,640
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1314
02:16:08,270 --> 02:16:09,690
She would do her duty.

1315
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:21,370
The droid army is in full retreat.

1316
02:16:21,410 --> 02:16:24,580
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

1317
02:16:51,560 --> 02:16:54,570
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

1318
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:56,630
We'll take him together.
Go in slowly on the left.

1319
02:16:56,650 --> 02:16:57,780
I'm taking him now!

1320
02:16:57,820 --> 02:17:00,280
No, Anakin! No! No!

1321
02:17:06,450 --> 02:17:10,250
As you see,
my Jedi powers are far beyond yours.

1322
02:17:10,290 --> 02:17:12,830
Now back down.

1323
02:17:18,090 --> 02:17:19,970
I don't think so.

1324
02:17:32,770 --> 02:17:35,520
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1325
02:17:35,570 --> 02:17:38,740
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1326
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:43,490
Surely you can do better.

1327
02:17:54,630 --> 02:17:57,300
- Are you all right?
- Uh-huh.

1328
02:17:59,300 --> 02:18:01,380
We'd better get back
to the forward command center.

1329
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:03,090
No. No.

1330
02:18:03,590 --> 02:18:06,600
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1331
02:18:06,640 --> 02:18:09,850
- Get a transport. Hurry!
- Right away.

1332
02:18:35,630 --> 02:18:36,920
Brave of you, boy.

1333
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:40,590
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

1334
02:18:40,630 --> 02:18:42,970
- I am a slow learner.
- Anakin!

1335
02:19:44,820 --> 02:19:49,450
- Master Yoda.
- Count Dooku.

1336
02:19:49,780 --> 02:19:53,200
You have interfered
with our affairs for the last time.

1337
02:20:23,690 --> 02:20:27,280
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1338
02:20:27,570 --> 02:20:30,780
The dark side I sense in you.

1339
02:20:31,070 --> 02:20:33,990
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.

1340
02:20:35,830 --> 02:20:37,120
Even you.

1341
02:20:51,640 --> 02:20:54,810
Much to learn you still have.

1342
02:20:55,390 --> 02:20:58,270
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided

1343
02:20:58,310 --> 02:21:01,560
by our knowledge of the Force...

1344
02:21:02,230 --> 02:21:05,110
but by our skills with a lightsaber.

1345
02:21:46,650 --> 02:21:50,110
Fought well you have, my old Padawan.

1346
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:52,150
This is just the beginning.

1347
02:23:06,900 --> 02:23:08,730
Anakin!

1348
02:24:24,930 --> 02:24:27,890
The Force is with us,
Master Sidious.

1349
02:24:27,940 --> 02:24:30,860
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1350
02:24:32,570 --> 02:24:35,150
You have done well.

1351
02:24:35,190 --> 02:24:37,280
I have good news for you, my lord.

1352
02:24:38,900 --> 02:24:42,320
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1353
02:24:42,370 --> 02:24:45,120
Everything is going as planned.

1354
02:24:55,250 --> 02:24:56,880
Do you believe
what Count Dooku said

1355
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:59,720
about Sidious controlling the Senate?

1356
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:01,970
It doesn't feel right.

1357
02:25:02,010 --> 02:25:05,100
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1358
02:25:06,470 --> 02:25:08,100
Lies, deceit,

1359
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:11,940
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1360
02:25:11,980 --> 02:25:16,650
Nevertheless, I feel we should
keep a closer eye on the Senate.

1361
02:25:16,690 --> 02:25:18,780
I agree.

1362
02:25:19,990 --> 02:25:22,030
Where is your apprentice?

1363
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:26,160
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1364
02:25:27,540 --> 02:25:30,960
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1365
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,130
Victory?

1366
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,630
Victory, you say?

1367
02:25:36,670 --> 02:25:40,470
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

1368
02:25:41,930 --> 02:25:45,300
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

1369
02:25:46,850 --> 02:25:50,980
Begun the Clone War has.
