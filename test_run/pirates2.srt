1
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,640
Will. Why is this happening?

2
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:28,480
I don't know.  You look beautiful.

3
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,370
I think it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.

4
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,490
Make way. Let me through!  How dare you!

5
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,140
Stand your men down at once! Do you hear me?

6
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,430
Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been too long.

7
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,230
Cutler Beckett?

8
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,020
It's Lord now. Actually.

9
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,620
Lord or not, you have no reason and no authority to arrest this man.

10
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,700
In fact, I do. Mr. Mercer?

11
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,530
The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner.

12
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,320
This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann!

13
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,560
Oh, is it? That's annoying, my mistake...  Arrest her.

14
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,380
- On what charges?!
- No!

15
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:22,770
Aha, here's the one for William Turner.  And I have another one for a Mr. James Norrington. Is he present?

16
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,070
What are the charges?

17
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,850
Commodore Norrington resigned his commission some months ago.

18
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,590
I don't believe that was the answer to the question I asked.

19
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,010
Lord Beckett, in the category of questions not answered -

20
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:40,190
We are under the jurisdiction of the King's governor of Port Royal and you will tell us what we are charged with.

21
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:47,730
The charge... is conspiring to set free a man convicted of crimes against the Crown and Empire

22
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,610
and condemned to death for which the...

23
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,310
For which the punishment, regrettably, is also death.

24
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,620
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.

25
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,630
Captain!

26
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,300
Captain Jack Sparrow.

27
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:13,710
Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought you might.

28
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:18,770
50 men on a dead man's chest.

29
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:23,940
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

30
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,450
Drink and the devil had done (??) for the rest.

31
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:35,790
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

32
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,490
Sorry, mate.

33
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,340
Do you mind if we make a little side trip?

34
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,010
I didn't think so.

35
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,170
Not quite according to plan.

36
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,590
Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.

37
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,990
You got what you went in for, then?

38
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,480
Muhuh.

39
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,390
Captain, I think the crew - meaning me, as well -

40
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,870
were expecting something a bit more...  shiny.

41
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,170
What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear-shapes, reclaimed by the sea and the treasure with it.

42
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,050
And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic.

43
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,540
And the hurricane!

44
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:27,420
All in all, it seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating.

45
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,920
Shiny?

46
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,560
Aye, shiny.

47
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,470
Is that how you're all feeling, then? Perhaps dear ol' Jack is not serving your best interests as Captain?

48
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,250
Awk, walk the plank.

49
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,900
What did the bird say?!

50
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,880
Do not blame the bird. Show us, what is on that piece of cloth there.

51
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,190
You know that don't do no good.

52
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,180
It does me.

53
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,500
It's a key.

54
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,770
No, much more better! It is a drawing of a key.

55
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:19,200
Gentlemen, what do keys do?

56
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,560
Keys... unlock things?

57
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,810
And whatever this key unlocks, inside there's something valuable.

58
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,320
So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!

59
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:37,380
No. We don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks.

60
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,270
So, what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have,

61
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,020
without first having found the key what unlocks it.

62
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,140
So, we're going after this key!

63
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:54,130
You're not making any sense at all. Any more questions?

64
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,900
So... Do we have a heading?

65
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,860
Ah!  A heading.

66
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,060
Set sail in a...

67
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,160
general...

68
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,570
that way direction!

69
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,770
Captain?

70
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,550
Come on. Snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Oi, oi!

71
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,110
I've notice lately,

72
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,920
the Captain seem to be acting a bit strange...er.

73
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,750
Setting sail without knowing his own heading,

74
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:39,390
something's got Jack vexed. You mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow, bodes ill for us all.

75
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,500
Lord Beckett, the prisoner as ordered, sir.

76
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,390
Those won't be necessary.

77
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,250
The East India Trading Company has need of your services.

78
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:16,520
We wish for you to act as our agent in a business transaction with our mutual friend - Captain Sparrow.

79
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,710
More acquaintance than friend. How do you know him?

80
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,110
We've had dealings in the past.

81
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,240
And we've each left our mark on the other.

82
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,540
What mark did he leave on you?

83
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,810
By your efforts, Jack Sparrow was set free.

84
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:40,310
I would like you to go to him and recover a certain property in his possession.

85
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,960
Recover. At the point of a sword?

86
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,370
Bargain.

87
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,190
Letters of Marque.

88
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:04,300
You will offer what amounts to a full pardon - Jack will be free, a privateer in the employ of England.

89
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,780
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free.

90
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,600
Freedom.

91
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,100
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

92
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,400
The world is shrinking. The blank edges of the map filled in.

93
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,700
Jack must find his place in the New World or perish.

94
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,810
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

95
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,840
You and your fianc? face the hangman's noose.

96
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,610
So you get both Jack and the Black Pearl.

97
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,430
The Black Pearl?

98
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,860
The property you want that he possesses.

99
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,900
A ship? Hardly.

100
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,090
The item in question is considerably smaller and far more valuable.

101
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,310
??

102
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,450
a compass?

103
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,320
Ah, you know it.

104
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,960
Bring back that compass, or there's no deal.

105
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,230
Why is the rum always gone?

106
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,370
Oh... that's why.

107
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,300
Time's run out, Jack.

108
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,120
Bootstrap. Bill Turner?

109
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,010
You look good, Jack.

110
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,280
Is this a dream?

111
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,100
No.

112
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,960
I thought not, if it were, there'd be rum.

113
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,310
You got the Pearl back, I see.

114
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,100
I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way.

115
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,750
Your son.

116
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,940
William?

117
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,210
Ended up pirate after all.

118
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,280
And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?

119
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,500
He sent me.

120
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,600
Davy Jones.

121
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,250
Ah. So it's you, then.

122
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,000
He shanghaied you into service, eh?

123
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,950
I chose it.

124
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,840
I'm sorry for the part I played in the mutiny against you, Jack.

125
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,090
I stood up for ya.

126
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,660
Everything went wrong after that.

127
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:09,310
They strapped me to a cannon, I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

128
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,930
the weight of the water crushing down on me.

129
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,070
Unable to move,

130
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,670
unable to die, Jack,

131
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:23,850
and I thought that even the tiniest hope of escaping this fate, I would take it.

132
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,110
I would trade anything for it.

133
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,300
It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment.

134
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,810
You made a deal with him, too, Jack.

135
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,750
He raised the Pearl from the depths for you, thirteen years you've been Captain.

136
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,950
Technically, I -

137
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,090
Jack. Won't be able to talk yourself out of this.

138
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,150
The terms would apply to me, apply to you, as well.

139
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:50,830
One soul, bound to crew a hundred years upon his ship.

140
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,320
Yes, but The Flying Dutchman already has a Captain, so there's really -

141
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,070
Then it's the Locker for you!

142
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,260
Though this is terrible, the leviathan will find you

143
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,240
and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it.

144
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:09,430
Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?

145
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,830
I already told you, Jack.

146
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,170
The time is up.

147
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:22,220
It comes now.(??)

148
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,180
the black spot.

149
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:38,430
On deck all hands! Make faster -- gasket! On deck! Scurry!

150
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,090
Scurry on! Move it! Move it!! I want movement!

151
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,010
Mr. Skinner, pick it up! (??)

152
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,700
I want a --- (??), plenty running.

153
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,970
Run as if the devil himself and itself was upon us!

154
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,970
Do we have a heading?

155
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,170
Ah!

156
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,910
Rum! Land.

157
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,240
Ah!

158
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,090
Which port?

159
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,320
I didn't say port. I said land, any land.  Ah!

160
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,840
Jack's hat! Steer about!

161
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,860
No, no, leave it.

162
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,910
Rum.

163
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,650
Back to your stations, the lot of ya!

164
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:30,730
Jack?

165
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,280
Shh!

166
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,050
For the love of Mother and Child, Jack, what's coming after us?

167
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,610
Nothing.

168
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,170
You're not... you can't be here.

169
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,660
I think you'll find he can.

170
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,290
Mr. Swann.

171
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:02,710
Governor Swann, still. Do you think I wear this wig to keep my head warm?

172
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,250
Jack's compass? What does Beckett want with that?

173
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:12,820
Doesn't matter. I'm to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal and in exchange the charges against us will be dropped.

174
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,680
No, we must find our own avenue to secure your freedom.

175
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,370
Is that a lack of faith in Jack... or in me?

176
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:25,780
You would risk your life to save Sparrow's does not mean that he would do the same for anyone else.

177
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,190
Now,

178
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,520
where's that dog with the keys?

179
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,530
I have faith in you. Both of you.

180
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,690
Where will you find him?

181
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,630
Tortuga.

182
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,690
I'll start there and I won't stop searching 'till I find him.

183
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,470
And then I intend to return here to marry you.

184
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,810
Properly?

185
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,030
With your leave, if you'll still have me.

186
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,720
If it weren't for these bars, I'd have you already.

187
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,630
I'll wait for you.

188
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,450
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

189
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,000
Captain Jack Sparrow?

190
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,110
Hadn't been thought about,

191
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,790
heard he was dead.

192
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,440
Singapore, that's what I heard. Drunk, with a smile on his face.

193
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,270
Sure as a tide, Jack Sparrow,

194
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,550
turned up in Singapore.

195
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,900
Jack Sparrow?

196
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,780
I haven't seen him in a month.

197
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,860
When you find him, you give him a message.

198
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,570
Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

199
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:50,170
but this island just south of the straits where I trade spice for...

200
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,530
delicious,long pork.

201
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:57,990
Cannot say about Jack. But you'll find that ship there.

202
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,110
A ship with black sails.

203
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,620
My brother will take you ashore.

204
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,340
What's wrong, the beach is right there?

205
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,800
Ne bougeais pas, c'set beaucoup trop dangereaux.

206
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,440
What?

207
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,010
Je ne pois, c'est trop dangereaux, j'avais le dit.  Bon voyage, monsieur.

208
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,230
Bon voyage, monsieur.

209
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,940
Jack! Jack Sparrow!

210
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,850
Marty!

211
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,080
Cotton!

212
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,780
Anybody?

213
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,820
Ah, a familiar face.

214
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,020
Awk, don't eat me!

215
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,500
I'm not going to eat you.

216
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,900
Don't eat me. Don't eat me. Awk!

217
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,630
Gibbs.

218
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,620
Come on! Let's go!

219
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,170
Come on!!

220
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,020
who wants it?!

221
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,810
I can do this all day!

222
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,780
Jack? Jack Sparrow.

223
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,400
I can honestly say I'm glad to see you.

224
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,960
Jack, it's me, Will Turner!

225
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,410
Tell them to let me down.

226
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:17,250
Jack, the compass, that's all I need. Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested for trying to help you.

227
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,710
She faces the gallows!

228
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,970
Maliki liki! Maliki liki!(??????)

229
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,380
Save me.

230
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,050
Jack, what did you tell them? No!

231
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,280
What about Elizabeth?

232
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,840
Jaaack!

233
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,240
Come quickly.

234
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,840
You've got to tell me what's happening.

235
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,090
I may still have some standing in the keep. I've arranged passage to England. The Captain is a friend of mine.

236
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,190
No! Will's gone to find Jack!

237
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,420
We cannot count on William Turner. Come!

238
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,050
He's a better man than you give him credit for.

239
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:18,560
Of course, this is no time for innocence. Beckett has offered one pardon only. One!

240
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,240
And that is promised to Jack Sparrow. Even if Will succeeds...

241
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,310
you're not asking me to endure the sight of my daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.

242
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,090
Perhaps, I can ensure a fair trial for Will, if he returns.

243
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,650
A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.

244
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,360
Then there is nothing left for you here.

245
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,160
Wait inside.

246
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,280
Captain?

247
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,660
Captain..

248
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,460
Evening, Gov'ner.  Shame, huh?

249
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:09,410
He was carrying this  It's a letter to the King.

250
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,210
It's from you.

251
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,570
Ah...  Elizabeth.

252
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,750
What are you doing?!

253
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,270
Where is she?

254
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,940
Who?

255
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:50,260
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm as your father believes.

256
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,840
Then what is?

257
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,570
I'm afraid currency is the currency of the realm.

258
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:00,540
I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding.

259
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,490
I'm here to negotiate.

260
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,150
I'm listening.

261
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,590
I'm listening intently.

262
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,050
These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King?

263
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:18,460
Yes, and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal.

264
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,420
Or else I would not still be here.

265
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,230
You sent Will to get you the compass and buy Jack Sparrow,

266
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,480
it will do you no good.

267
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,080
Do explain.

268
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,810
I have been to the Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself.

269
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,180
There is something you need to know.

270
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,100
Aah, I see.

271
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:45,390
You think the compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta and so you hope to save me from an evil fate.

272
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,370
But you mustn't worry.

273
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:54,660
I care not for cursed Aztec gold, my desires are not so provincial.

274
00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:00,150
There's more than one chest of value in these waters.

275
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,650
So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer.

276
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,620
Consider it in your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.

277
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,350
So I did.

278
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,170
A marriage interrupted.

279
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,660
Or fate intervenes.

280
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,850
You're making great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

281
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,070
These are not going to Jack.

282
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,870
Oh, really. To insure Mr. Turner's freedom?

283
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:39,080
I'll still want that compass. Consider that in your calculations.

284
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,740
Well, I say it was divine providence what escaped us from jail.

285
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:08,540
And I'll say, it was me being clever. Ain't that right, poochy?

286
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,640
Well, how d'you know it weren't divine providence what inspired you to be clever.

287
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,750
Anyways, I'm no' stealing no ship.

288
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:20,130
It ain't stealing, it's salvaging. And since when did you care?

289
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:24,420
Since we're not immortal no more. We've got to take care of our immortal souls.

290
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,400
You know you can't read.

291
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,740
It's the Bible, you get credit for trying.

292
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:35,630
Pretending to read the Bible's a laugh! That's a mark against the...

293
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,970
Look.  There it is.

294
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,290
It's gonna swim?

295
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,260
Must've seen a catfish.

296
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,040
Stupid mongrel!

297
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,090
Come on!

298
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,020
It's ours for the taking!

299
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:29,120
Tide's coming in, that should help. Salvaging is saving, in a manner of speaking.

300
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,400
There's the truth of it!

301
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:44,580
Suppose we'd better save it as soon as we can. What with us in such a vulnerable state, y'know?

302
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,450
Amen to that.

303
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,480
Thank you.

304
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,450
Why would he do this to us? If Jack is the chief -

305
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:31,300
Aye. The Pelegostos have made Jack their chief. But he only remains chief as long as he acts like a chief.

306
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,340
So he had no choice. He's a captive there as much as the rest of us.

307
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:40,880
Worse, as it turns out. You see, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a god in human form.

308
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,680
And they intend to do 'im the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

309
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,100
They'll roast him and eat him.

310
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,080
Where's the rest of the crew?

311
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,800
These cages we're in weren't built 'till after we got here.

312
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,980
The feast is about to begin. Jack's life will end...

313
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,600
when the drums stop.

314
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,200
Well, we can't just sit here and wait then, can we?

315
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,510
No! No no. Oi, no no! More wood.

316
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,730
Big fire. Big fire! I am chief, want big fire!

317
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,250
C'mon then.

318
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,310
More wood.

319
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,520
Oh, bugger.

320
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,710
A little seasoning, aye?

321
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,680
Well done.

322
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,030
Put your legs through! Start the climb!

323
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:56,430
Come on men, it'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!

324
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:01,520
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone. About six would do.

325
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,850
Oooh, dear.

326
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,010
Hurry!

327
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,940
Heave! Is that all you've got?

328
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,340
Stop, stop. Stop!

329
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,330
What are you doning? Stop!

330
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,680
Snake!

331
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,990
Move!

332
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,710
Fire! fire!

333
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,180
Well, go on, go get them! Helalla!

334
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,920
Helalla! No no, oi! No no.

335
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,880
Not good.

336
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,110
Pull it loose, find a rock!

337
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,500
Roll the cage!

338
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,290
Lift the cage!

339
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,880
Hurry!

340
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,300
Lift it high like a lady's skirt.

341
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,160
This way lads.

342
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,710
Stop it!

343
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:10,050
Pull loose the mooring line. The mooring line!

344
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:14,490
Hey! Little hairy thing. Give it back!  Don't bite it!

345
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,000
Pull loose the mooring line!

346
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,120
It's got me eye. It won't give it back.

347
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,770
Well, how'd you get it back last time?

348
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,620
Excellent! Our work's half done!

349
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,450
We done it for you! Knew you'd be coming back for it.

350
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,810
Make ready to sail, boys!

351
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,930
What about Jack? I won't leave without him.

352
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,350
Oi!

353
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,830
Time to go.

354
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,660
Cast off those lines!

355
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,550
Make ready to cast off!

356
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,930
Oi! Good doggy.

357
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,460
Hurry up!!!

358
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:21,050
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost

359
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,830
- Captain Jack Sparrow.

360
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:54,990
Let's put some distance between us and this island and head out to open sea.

361
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,260
Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only as so far as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.

362
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,550
Now, that seems a bit contradictory, Captain.

363
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:07,880
I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs. Now, where is that monkey? I want to shoot something.

364
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:13,850
Jack.

365
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:14,780
Ah.

366
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,730
Elizabeth is in danger.

367
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:18,560
Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on her. Maybe just lock her up somewhere?

368
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,200
She is locked up in a prison, bound to hang for helping you.

369
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,450
There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes.

370
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:31,970
I need that compass of yours, Jack. I must trade it for her freedom.

371
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,850
Mr. Gibbs?

372
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,590
Captain?

373
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,480
We have a need to travel upriver.

374
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:47,690
By need, do you, mean a trifling need, fleeting, as in, say, a passing fancy?

375
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,920
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

376
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,660
What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

377
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:01,780
William... I shall trade you the compass, if you will help me...

378
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,520
to find this.

379
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,910
You want me to find this.

380
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:13,220
No. You want you to find this.

381
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:24,420
Because the finding of this, finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating in your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly belle ol' what's her face.

382
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,150
Savvy?

383
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,900
This is going to save Elizabeth.

384
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,190
How much do you know about Davy Jones?

385
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,660
Not much.

386
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,690
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

387
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,650
What's all this?

388
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:17,490
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share and wear it one after the other.

389
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,100
It's not like that, sir. This ship is haunted.

390
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,830
Is it now?  You?

391
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:27,490
There is a female presence amongst us here, sir.

392
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,960
All the men, they can feel it.

393
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,060
Belongs to a lady widowed before her marriage, I figure it.

394
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,400
Searching for her husband lost the sea.

395
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,250
Virgin, too, likely as not.  And that bodes ill by all accounts.

396
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:45,670
I say that we throw the dress overboard and we hope the spirit follows it.

397
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,610
No! That will just anger this spirit, sir.

398
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:52,840
What we need to do is to find out what the spirit needs and then just get it back to her

399
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,230
Enough! Enough!

400
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,100
You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of ye.

401
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,360
Now this appears to be as no more that we have a stowaway on board.

402
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:07,460
A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find her.

403
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,910
Oh, and, eh, she's probably naked.

404
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,280
Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?

405
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:48,130
Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones.

406
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:52,630
A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off

407
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,750
and drag an entire ship down to the crushing darkness.

408
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,220
The Kraken.

409
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:06,450
They say the stench of its breath is... ooh.

410
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:17,560
Imagine, the last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the Kraken and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses.

411
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,440
If you believe such things.

412
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,250
And the key will spare him that?

413
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:26,130
Now that's the very question Jack wants answered.

414
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:29,630
Bad enough even to go visit...

415
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,850
her.

416
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,760
Her?

417
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,360
Aye.

418
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,640
No worries, mates.

419
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,750
Tia Dalma and I go way back. Thick as thieves.

420
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,510
Nigh inseparable we are.

421
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:22,260
Were... Have been. Before.

422
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,410
I'll watch your back.

423
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,820
It's me front I'm worried about.

424
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,090
Mind the boat.

425
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:26,780
Mind the boat.

426
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:29,140
Mind the boat.

427
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,530
Mind the boat.

428
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:31,380
Mind the boat.

429
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,110
Mind the boat.

430
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,260
Jack Sparrow.

431
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,450
Tia Dalma.

432
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:57,970
I always knowed the wind was going to blow you back to me one day.

433
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,360
You...

434
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:12,430
You have a touch a' destiny about you.

435
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:15,990
William. Turner.

436
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:18,880
You know me?

437
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,230
You want to know me.

438
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:25,560
There'll be no knowing here.  We've come for help and we're not leaving without it.

439
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,800
I thought I knew you.

440
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,080
Not so well as I'd hoped. Come.

441
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,660
Come.

442
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,330
What service may I do ya?

443
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:41,630
You know I demand payment.

444
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,000
I brought payment.

445
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:54,350
Look...  an undead monkey. Top that!

446
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,520
No.  You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.

447
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,910
The payment is fair.

448
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:07,850
We're looking for this.

449
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,180
And what it goes to.

450
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:19,270
The compass you bartered from me, it cannot lead you to this?

451
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:22,520
Maybe. Why?

452
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:30,310
Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants.

453
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:36,610
Or do you know but are loath to claim it as your own.

454
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:45,250
Your key go to a chest. And it is what lay inside the chest you seek. Don't it?

455
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,690
What is inside?

456
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:52,460
Gold? Jewels? Unclaimed properties of valuable nature?

457
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:56,280
Nothing bad, I hope.

458
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,750
You know of Davy Jones, yes?

459
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,360
A man of the sea.

460
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:11,200
A great sailor. Until he run afoul of that which vex all men.

461
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,400
What vexes all men?

462
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,290
What indeed.

463
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:19,240
The sea?

464
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,640
Sums.

465
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,870
The dichotomy of good and evil.

466
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,080
A woman!

467
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,870
A woman. He fell in love.

468
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:33,040
No no no no, I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.

469
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,630
Same story, different version and all are true.

470
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:45,490
See it was a woman as changing, and harsh and untamable as the sea.

471
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,800
He never stopped loving her.

472
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,670
But the pain it caused him was too much to live with.

473
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:57,300
But not enough to cause him to die.

474
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,430
What exactly did he put into the chest?

475
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,490
Him heart.

476
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:05,680
Literally or figuratively?

477
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,180
He couldn't live, putting his heart in a chest.

478
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,430
Could he?

479
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:20,050
It was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings. And so,

480
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:29,020
him carved out him heart, lock it down in a chest, and hide the chest from the world.

481
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:36,170
The key he keep with him at all times.

482
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:37,280
You knew this.

483
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,000
I did not. I didn't know where the key was. But now we do.

484
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,050
So, all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, aye?

485
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,430
Let me see your hand.

486
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,980
The black spot! The black spot.

487
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,470
Black spot.

488
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:12,900
My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.

489
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:35,980
Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot step on land but once every ten years.

490
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:42,410
Land is where you will be safe, Jack Sparrow, and so you will carry land with you.

491
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:55,640
Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.

492
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,460
Yes.

493
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,870
Is the... jar of dirt going to help?

494
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,910
If you don't want it, give it back.

495
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,820
No.

496
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,500
Then it helps.

497
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:16,610
It seems... we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.

498
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:23,650
A touch...  of destiny.

499
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,320
That's the Flying Dutchman?

500
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:44,370
She doesn't look like much.

501
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:49,510
Neither do you... do not underestimate it.

502
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,110
Must've run afoul of the reef.

503
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:53,660
What's your plan?

504
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:57,150
I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.

505
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:59,620
And if there are crewmen?

506
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,620
I cut down anyone in my path.

507
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,830
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

508
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:09,220
Your chariot awaits you. Ahahaha!

509
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:50,020
Go on your whereabouts and pray.

510
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,330
Get back! Back!

511
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,220
Five men still alive, the rest have moved on.

512
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:04,230
Do you fear death?

513
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:10,840
Do you fear that dark abyss?

514
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:19,260
All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished.

515
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:24,000
I can offer you an escape.

516
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,490
Don't listen to him!

517
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:41,000
Do you not fear death?

518
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,760
I'll take my chances, sir.

519
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,150
To the depths.

520
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,740
Cold blood!

521
00:58:53,740 --> 00:59:02,990
Life is cruel. Why should the afterlife be any different? I offer you a choice.

522
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:09,360
Join my crew and postpone the judgment.

523
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:15,380
One hundred years before the mast.

524
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:19,470
Will ye serve?

525
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,150
I-I-I will serve.

526
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:23,540
That-a.

527
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:35,090
You are neither dead nor dying. What is your purpose here?

528
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:42,980
Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.

529
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,330
What is your purpose here?

530
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:52,060
Jack Sparrow... sent me to settle his debt.

531
00:59:52,060 --> 01:00:00,640
Ha. Did he now? I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

532
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:23,450
You have a debt to pay. You've been Captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. That was our agreement.

533
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:27,270
Technically, I was only Captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.

534
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:33,090
Then you were a poor Captain, but a Captain nonetheless. Have you not introduced yourself

535
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:39,810
all these years as 'Captain Jack Sparrow'?

536
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:42,800
Yeah, I gave you payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.

537
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,990
One soul is not equal to another.

538
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:50,230
Aha! So we've establish my proposal is sound in principle, now we're just haggling over price.

539
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,580
Price?

540
01:00:57,450 --> 01:01:00,580
Just how many souls, do you think, my soul is worth?

541
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:10,110
One hundred souls. Three days.

542
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:13,670
You're a darling, mate. Send me back the boy, I'll get started right off.

543
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:22,770
I keep the boy, a good, faith payment. That leaves you only ninety-nine to go. Haha, haha.

544
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:29,990
Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic, a terrific soprano. Worth at least four,

545
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:36,080
maybe three and a half..And did I happen to mention...

546
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:47,520
he's in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed.

547
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:57,370
Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?

548
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:05,510
I keep the boy. Ninty-nine souls-ah.

549
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:08,550
But I wonder, Sparrow...

550
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:20,040
can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend - to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?

551
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:28,280
Yep. I'm good with it. Shall we seal it in blood, I mean, uh, ink?

552
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,640
Three days-ah.

553
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,900
Three days.

554
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:51,060
Uh, Mr. Gibbs?

555
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,750
Aye.

556
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:55,110
I feel sullied and unusual.

557
01:02:55,110 --> 01:03:00,670
And how do we intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days?

558
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:05,860
Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be.

559
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:09,640
Aah, Tortuga.

560
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,540
Tortuga.

561
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:21,920
It's an outrage. Port Tariff's buried (??) in fees, war handling and, heaven help us, pilotage.

562
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,420
Are we all to work for these India Trading Company, then?

563
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:31,020
I'm afraid, sir... Tortuga is the only free post left in these waters.

564
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:38,270
A pirate port is what you mean. Well, I'm sorry, an honest sailor is what I am and make my living fair and I sleep well each night, thank you.

565
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,090
Sir!

566
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:07,240
She wants you to do something.

567
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:11,790
She's trying to give a sign.

568
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,030
Look, there! There it is! There's the sign.

569
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,620
I seen it.

570
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,560
So we can be saved. Looks like entrails.

571
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,880
That'd be a bad sign.

572
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,350
What's that over there?

573
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,860
And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?

574
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:08,060
Truth be told, I never sailed a day in me life. I figure I should get out and see the world while I'm still young.

575
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:11,850
You'll do. Make your mark.  Next!

576
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:21,580
My wife run off with my dog, and I'm drunk for a month, and I don't give an ass rat's if I live or die.

577
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:24,630
Perfect! Next!

578
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:26,960
Me have one arm and a bum leg.

579
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,710
It's the crow's nest for you.

580
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:29,760
I know what I want.

581
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,790
Next!

582
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:36,440
Ever since I was little, I've always wanted to sail the seas. Forever.

583
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,140
Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.

584
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:41,380
Thanks very much.

585
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:42,810
How are we going?

586
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:46,870
Including those four? That gives us... four.

587
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,720
And what's your story?

588
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,910
My story?

589
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:59,700
It's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind.

590
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:11,150
I chased a man across the seven seas. (??)and my life.

591
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:17,190
Commodore?

592
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:19,610
No, not anymore, weren't you listening?

593
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:31,830
I nearly had you all off Tripoli. I would've, if not for the hurricane.

594
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:35,160
Lord. You didn't try to sail through it?

595
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:40,710
So do I make your crew or not?

596
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:43,400
You haven't said where you're going.

597
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,520
Somewhere nice!

598
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:51,490
So am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow?

599
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:56,490
Or should I just kill you now?

600
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,080
You're hired.

601
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,380
Sorry. Old habits and all that.

602
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,930
Easy sailor!

603
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:27,220
Time to go.

604
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:27,950
Aye.

605
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,040
Thanks, mate.

606
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,800
Carry on.

607
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:36,500
Come on, then! Who wants some? For my lordly line, I'll have you one by one. Come on, who's first?

608
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,330
I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself.

609
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:15,020
James Norrington.  What has the world done to you?

610
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:52,410
Heave! Heave! Heave!

611
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:04,050
Secure the mast, man called Mr. Turner.

612
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,750
Secure it!

613
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:17,200
- Step aside!
- mind yourself!

614
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,360
Hey! Let go, boy!

615
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:35,220
Haul that weasel to his feet.

616
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:44,270
Five lashes are in my due. To stay honor.

617
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:45,710
No.

618
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:51,870
Impeding me in my duties? You'll share the punishment.

619
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:53,290
I'll take it all.

620
01:10:53,290 --> 01:11:00,990
Will you now? And what would prompt such an act of charity?

621
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:05,340
My son.

622
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:12,460
He's my son.

623
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:31,990
What fortuitous circumstance be this. Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.

624
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,360
No. No, I won't!

625
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:47,900
The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner. Your issue will feel its sting be it at the Bo'sun's hand or your own.

626
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,830
No.

627
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:55,700
- Bo'sun!
- No!

628
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:42,780
You've had it easy boy.

629
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:43,920
Will!

630
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,790
I don't need your help.

631
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:53,850
The Bo'sun prides himself on cleaving flesh from bone with every swing.

632
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:58,910
So I'm to understand what you did was an act of compassion.

633
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:00,190
Yes.

634
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:17,730
One hundred years before the mast. Loosing who you are, bit by bit.
'Till you end up, end up like poor, Wyvern, here.

635
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:25,130
Once you've sworn an oath to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it. 
Not until your debt is paid.

636
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:26,770
I've sworn no oath.

637
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:32,880
Then you must get away.

638
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,940
Not until I find this.

639
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,870
The key.

640
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,990
The Dead Man's Chest.

641
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:51,080
What do you know of it?

642
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:58,540
Open the chest with the key and stab the heart. No, don't stab the heart.

643
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:08,410
The Dutchman needs a living heart or there'll be no captain. If there's no captain, there's no one to have the key.

644
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:12,030
So the Captain has the key.

645
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,030
Where is the key?

646
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:15,180
Hidden.

647
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:16,750
Where is the chest.

648
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:21,070
Hidden.

649
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:22,970
Captain Sparrow?

650
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:25,490
Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard.

651
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:29,040
I'm here to find the man I love.

652
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,320
I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.

653
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:38,830
Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.

654
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:42,460
Elizabeth?  Hide the rum.

655
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:47,680
You know these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.

656
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,720
Jack.

657
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,220
I know Will came to find you, where is he?

658
01:14:54,220 --> 01:15:04,320
Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me,

659
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:15,320
poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew.
