1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,000
A long time ago in a galaxy far,
far away....

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:23,000
STAR
WARS

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:34,500
Episode VII
THE FORCE AWAKENS

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,500
Luke Skywalker has vanished.

5
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,300
In his absence, the sinister FIRST ORDER has
risen from the ashes of the Empire...

6
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,500
and will not rest until Skywalker,
the last Jedi, has been destroyed.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
With the support of the REPUBLIC,
General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,000
She is desperate to find
her brother Luke and gain his help...

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,500
in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy.

10
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Leia has sent her most daring pilot
on a secret mission to Jakku...

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,000
where an old ally has discovered
a clue to Luke’s whereabouts....

12
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,875
This will begin to make things right.

13
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:03,577
I've travelled too far, and seen too much,
to ignore the despair in the galaxy.

14
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:07,968
Without the Jedi, there can
be no balance in the Force.

15
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,043
Well because of you,
now we have a chance.

16
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:13,288
The General's been
after this for a long time.

17
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:14,744
"The General"?

18
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:17,231
To me, she's royalty.

19
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:19,549
Well, she certainly is that.

20
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:26,473
We got company.

21
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,396
You have to hide.

22
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:42,233
You have to leave.

23
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:45,436
Go!

24
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,451
Come on BB-8, hurry!

25
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:33,589
<i>Blast that X-wing!
Over there! Over there!</i>

26
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:40,764
I see 'em!

27
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,623
You take this.
It's safer with you than it is with me.

28
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:18,957
You get as far away
from here as you can.

29
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:20,535
Do you hear me?

30
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:22,678
I'll come back for you!

31
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,894
It'll be all right.

32
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,322
<i>Keep moving!</i>

33
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:28,526
<i>Stay here.</i>

34
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,701
<i>Look how old you've become.</i>

35
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:58,031
Something far worse has happened to you.

36
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:01,232
<i>You know what I've come for.</i>

37
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:03,418
I know where you come from.

38
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:06,038
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.

39
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:09,756
<i>The map to Skywalker.
We know you found it.</i>

40
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,468
<i>And now you're going to
give it to the First Order.</i>

41
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:16,136
The First Order rose
from the Dark Side.

42
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:17,473
You did not.

43
00:07:18,116 --> 00:07:21,114
<i>I'll show you the Dark Side.</i>

44
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,635
You may try.

45
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:27,214
But you can not deny the truth,
that is your family.

46
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,393
<i>You're so right.</i>

47
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,015
So who talks first?
You talk first, I talk first?

48
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:08,268
<i>The old man gave it to you.</i>

49
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:10,121
It's just very hard to understand
you with all the...

50
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:11,235
<i>Search him.</i>

51
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:12,436
...apparatus.

52
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:16,888
<i>Nothing sir.</i>

53
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:17,989
<i>Put him on board.</i>

54
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:26,533
<i>Sir, the villagers.</i>

55
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,934
<i>Kill them all.</i>

56
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:33,127
<i>On my command.</i>

57
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:35,430
<i>Fire!</i>

58
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:37,539
No, no!

59
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:08,231
<i>Nothing here.
Go ahead!</i>

60
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:51,324
All right. All right!

61
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:18,880
<i>FN-2187.</i>

62
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:22,015
<i>Submit your blaster for inspection.</i>

63
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,660
Yes, Captain.

64
00:10:24,351 --> 00:10:27,056
<i>And who gave you permission
to remove that helmet?</i>

65
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:28,486
I'm sorry, Captain.

66
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,079
<i>Report to my division at once.</i>

67
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,535
What you brought me today is worth...

68
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,859
...one quarter portion.

69
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:05,320
Tal'ama parqual!

70
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:11,279
Parqual zatana!

71
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:17,895
Noma!

72
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:25,419
Shh!

73
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:29,382
That's just Teedo.
Wants you for parts.

74
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:32,000
He has no respect for anyone.

75
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:37,000
Your antenna is bent.

76
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:47,935
Where do you come from?

77
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:54,579
Classified, really?
Me too. Big secret.

78
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:58,385
Niima Outpost is that way,
stay off Kelvin Ridge.

79
00:15:58,486 --> 00:16:02,065
Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north.
You'll drown in the sand.

80
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:10,223
Don't follow me.
Town is that way.

81
00:16:13,095 --> 00:16:14,374
No!

82
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:32,188
In the morning, you go.

83
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:39,223
You're welcome.

84
00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:55,035
<i>I had no idea we had the best
pilot in the Resistance on board.</i>

85
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,326
<i>Comfortable?</i>

86
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,179
Not really.

87
00:17:01,122 --> 00:17:02,737
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

88
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:07,072
<i>No one has been
able to get out of you...</i>

89
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:10,459
<i>...what you did with the map.</i>

90
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:13,313
You might wanna rethink
your technique.

91
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:31,144
<i>Where is it?</i>

92
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:36,847
The Resistance will not
be intimidated by you.

93
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:43,844
<i>Where... is it?</i>

94
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:56,358
<i>It's in a droid.
A BB unit.</i>

95
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,993
Well then. If it's on Jakku,
we'll soon have it.

96
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:01,054
<i>I leave that to you.</i>

97
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:05,709
Don't give up hope.
He still might show up.

98
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,315
Whoever it is your
waiting for. Classified.

99
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:11,962
I know all about waiting.

100
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,090
For my family.

101
00:18:15,774 --> 00:18:18,512
They'll be back.
One day.

102
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:20,235
Come on.

103
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:26,500
These five pieces are worth...

104
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:28,675
let me see here...

105
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:32,087
...one half portion.

106
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:34,234
Last week they were
a half portion each.

107
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:36,179
What about the droid?

108
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:39,959
What about him?

109
00:18:40,094 --> 00:18:42,125
I'll pay for him.

110
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,288
60 portions.

111
00:19:02,494 --> 00:19:03,694
Actually...

112
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,133
...the droid is not for sale.

113
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:10,627
Come on.

114
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:17,590
Follow the girl and get that droid.

115
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:22,776
<i>Ren wants the prisoner.</i>

116
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,880
<i>Turn here.</i>

117
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:38,482
<i>Listen carefully. If you do exactly
as I say, I can get out of here.</i>

118
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:39,583
What?

119
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,887
This is a rescue.
I'm helping you escape.

120
00:19:42,988 --> 00:19:44,623
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

121
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,930
You with the Resistance?

122
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:47,996
What? No no no.
I'm breaking you out.

123
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:50,517
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?
- I can fly anything.

124
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:53,535
Why are you helping me?

125
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:56,645
Because it's the
right thing to do.

126
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:58,319
You need a pilot.

127
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,834
I need a pilot.

128
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:02,751
We're gonna do this.

129
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:03,797
Yeah?

130
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,377
<i>Okay, stay calm,
stay calm.</i>

131
00:20:10,378 --> 00:20:11,478
I am calm.

132
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,138
<i>I'm talking to myself.</i>

133
00:20:15,262 --> 00:20:16,362
<i>Not yet.</i>

134
00:20:18,236 --> 00:20:19,711
<i>Okay go. This way.</i>

135
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:28,109
I always wanted to fly one of these things.

136
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:30,300
- Can you shoot?
- Blasters, I can.

137
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:31,550
Okay, same principle.

138
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,896
Use the toggle on the left to switch between
missiles, cannons and mag pulse.

139
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:37,086
Use the site on the right to aim.
Triggers to fire.

140
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:38,373
This is very complicated.

141
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:45,957
I can fix this.

142
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,803
We have an unsanctioned
departure from Bay 2.

143
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:54,875
Alert General Hux.
And stop that fighter.

144
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:18,988
I got it!

145
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:25,003
This thing really moves.

146
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:33,100
All right, we gotta take out as many of these
cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far.

147
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:33,690
All right.

148
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:35,905
I'm gonna get us in position.
Just stay sharp.

149
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,470
Up ahead, up ahead!
You see it?

150
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:42,663
I've got us dead centered.
It's a clean shot.

151
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:53,061
- Yeah!
- Yes!

152
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,031
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

153
00:21:55,032 --> 00:21:56,032
I saw it.

154
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:02,403
Hey, what's your name?

155
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,900
FN-2187.

156
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:05,445
F... what?

157
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,116
That's the only name they ever gave me.

158
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:09,697
Well I ain't using it.
FN, huh?

159
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,204
Finn.
I'm gonna call you Finn.

160
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,205
Is that all right?

161
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,544
"Finn". Yeah "Finn".
I like that!

162
00:22:14,545 --> 00:22:15,545
I like that!

163
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:16,860
I'm Poe.
Poe Dameron.

164
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,381
- Good to meet you, Poe.
- Good to meet you too, Finn!

165
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:24,752
Sir. They've taken out
our turbolasers.

166
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:27,247
Use the ventral cannons.

167
00:22:27,503 --> 00:22:29,104
Yes sir.
Bringing them online.

168
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:32,189
<i>General Hux.
Is it the Resistance pilot?</i>

169
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,167
Yes, and he had help.
From one of our own.

170
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:40,053
We're checking the registers now
to identify which Stormtrooper it was.

171
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:43,567
<i>The one from the village.
FN-2187.</i>

172
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:46,299
Sir.
Ventral cannons hot.

173
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:47,771
Fire!

174
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:59,404
One's coming towards you.
My right, your left. Do you see it?

175
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,736
Hold on.
I see it!

176
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:06,129
Nice shot!

177
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:13,618
Where are we going?

178
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:15,619
We're going back to Jakku.
That's where.

179
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,240
We can't go back to Jakku.
We need to get outta this system.

180
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:20,205
I gotta get my droid before
the First Order does.

181
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:21,666
- What... a droid?
- That's right.

182
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,973
He's a BB unit, orange and white.
One of a kind.

183
00:23:23,974 --> 00:23:26,266
I don't care what color he is!
No droid can be that important!

184
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:27,254
This one is, pal!

185
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:29,208
We gotta get as far away
from the First Order as we can.

186
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:30,644
We go back to Jakku, we die.

187
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:33,560
That droid has a map that
leads straight to Luke Skywalker!

188
00:23:33,593 --> 00:23:35,231
You gotta be kidding me...

189
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:44,190
<i>FN-2187 reported to my division,
was evaluated and sent to Reconditioning.</i>

190
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:46,303
No prior signs of non-conformity?

191
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:48,127
<i>This was his first offense.</i>

192
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:49,328
General.

193
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:50,552
They've been hit.

194
00:23:50,653 --> 00:23:52,270
- Destroyed?
- Disabled.

195
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,692
They were heading back to Jakku.

196
00:23:53,717 --> 00:23:56,185
The fighter's projected to crash
in the Goazon Badlands.

197
00:23:56,186 --> 00:24:00,054
They were going back for the droid.
Send a squad to the wreckage.

198
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:23,424
Poe!

199
00:24:24,806 --> 00:24:25,875
Poe!

200
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:27,857
Poe!

201
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:33,115
Poe! I got you.

202
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:35,919
Poe!

203
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:43,774
Poe!

204
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:10,192
<i>Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.</i>

205
00:26:10,354 --> 00:26:12,822
Capture the droid if we can,
but destroy it if we must.

206
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:14,818
<i>How capable are
your soldiers, General?</i>

207
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:16,410
I won't have you question my methods.

208
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:18,652
<i>They're obviously skilled at
committing high treason.</i>

209
00:26:18,653 --> 00:26:21,280
<i>Perhaps Leader Snoke should
consider using a clone army.</i>

210
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,788
My men are exceptionally trained.
Programmed from birth.

211
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:26,309
<i>Then they should have
no problem retrieving the droid.</i>

212
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:27,594
<i>Unharmed.</i>

213
00:26:28,364 --> 00:26:33,235
Careful, Ren. That your personal interests
not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.

214
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:35,508
<i>I want that map.</i>

215
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:38,611
<i>For your sake,
I suggest you get it.</i>

216
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,176
Water...

217
00:26:47,178 --> 00:26:48,178
Water...

218
00:26:50,888 --> 00:26:52,200
Is that water?

219
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,032
What?

220
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:22,493
Get away!

221
00:27:32,204 --> 00:27:33,104
Hey!

222
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,067
<i>They work for Unkar.</i>

223
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:55,556
<i>He must have really wanted you.</i>

224
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,056
Who?

225
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,929
Him?

226
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:22,551
What's your hurry, thief?

227
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:24,466
What? Thief?

228
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:26,798
Hey! What?

229
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:28,965
The jacket!
This droid says you stole it.

230
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:31,564
I've had a pretty messed up day, all right?

231
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:34,200
So I'd appreciate it
if you stop accusing me...

232
00:28:34,765 --> 00:28:36,411
- Stop it!
- Where'd you get it?

233
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:38,339
It belongs to his master.

234
00:28:41,329 --> 00:28:44,581
It belonged to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?

235
00:28:46,645 --> 00:28:48,968
He was captured,
by the First Order.

236
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:51,813
I helped him escape,
but our ship crashed.

237
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,415
Poe didn't make it.

238
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:03,212
Look, I tried to help him.
I'm sorry...

239
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,876
So you're with the Resistance?

240
00:29:17,593 --> 00:29:18,836
Obviously.

241
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,328
Yes I am.

242
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:23,650
I'm with the Resistance, yeah.
I am with the Resistance.

243
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:27,890
I've never met a Resistance fighter before.

244
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:33,172
This is what we look like.
Some of us. Others look different.

245
00:29:33,427 --> 00:29:36,286
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.
He has to get back to your base.

246
00:29:36,387 --> 00:29:38,802
Apparently he has a map that
leads to Luke Skywalker...

247
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:40,518
and everyone's after it.

248
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:42,727
Luke Skywalker?

249
00:29:43,238 --> 00:29:44,818
I thought he was a myth.

250
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,578
What?

251
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:56,541
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

252
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,223
Come on, BB-8!

253
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,185
- Let go of me!
- Come on, we gotta move!

254
00:30:04,186 --> 00:30:06,460
I know how to run without
you holding my hand!

255
00:30:08,596 --> 00:30:09,878
BB-8 stay close!

256
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,512
This way!

257
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,012
<i>Call in the air strike!</i>

258
00:30:22,213 --> 00:30:23,713
They're shooting at both of us.

259
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:25,764
Yeah, they saw you with me.
You're marked.

260
00:30:25,765 --> 00:30:27,278
Well, thanks for that!

261
00:30:27,322 --> 00:30:29,633
I'm not the one who
chased you down with a stick!

262
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,000
Does anyone have blasters around here?

263
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:32,950
Are you okay?

264
00:30:38,913 --> 00:30:41,110
Stop taking my hand!

265
00:30:56,727 --> 00:30:57,727
Hey!

266
00:31:01,002 --> 00:31:02,211
Are you okay?

267
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,922
Yeah.

268
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:06,726
Follow me.

269
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:18,915
We can't outrun them!

270
00:31:18,931 --> 00:31:20,925
We might... in that quad-jumper!

271
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:22,716
We need a pilot!

272
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:23,917
We've got one!

273
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:24,918
You?

274
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:27,756
What about that ship?

275
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:29,551
That one's garbage!

276
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:36,233
The garbage will do.

277
00:31:52,347 --> 00:31:54,135
Gunner position is down there!

278
00:31:57,122 --> 00:31:58,840
You ever fly this thing?

279
00:31:58,941 --> 00:32:01,855
No! This ship hasn't flown in years!

280
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:03,049
Great.

281
00:32:09,247 --> 00:32:10,965
I can do this, I can do this.

282
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:13,331
I can do this, I can do this.

283
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:35,004
Hey!

284
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:41,386
That's mine!

285
00:32:44,861 --> 00:32:46,110
Stay low! Stay low!

286
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:47,211
- What?
- Stay low!

287
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:48,707
It confuses their tracking!

288
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,772
BB-8, hold on!

289
00:32:51,073 --> 00:32:52,548
I'm going low!

290
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:12,337
What are you doing back there?

291
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:13,676
Are you ever gonna fire back?

292
00:33:13,677 --> 00:33:14,829
I'm working on it!

293
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,564
- Are the shields up?
- Not so easy without a co-pilot.

294
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:19,360
Try sitting in this thing.

295
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,290
We need cover, quick!

296
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,570
We're about to get some!

297
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:37,735
I hope.

298
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:04,975
Dammit!

299
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:17,593
Come on, come on...

300
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:23,046
- Nice shot!
- I'm getting pretty good at this!

301
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:39,243
The cannon's stuck in forward position,
I can't move it!

302
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,397
You gotta lose 'em.

303
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:47,268
- Get ready!
- Okay... for what?

304
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,070
Are we really doing this?

305
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,890
Oh no...

306
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:50,573
- Nice shooting.
- That was some flying.

307
00:35:50,574 --> 00:35:51,174
Thanks!

308
00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:52,275
- How did you do that?
- I don't know!

309
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:53,293
No one trained you?

310
00:35:53,294 --> 00:35:54,793
I've flown some ships
but I've never left the planet!

311
00:35:54,794 --> 00:35:56,175
- Your last shot was dead on.
- That was amazing!

312
00:35:56,176 --> 00:35:58,029
- You got him with one blast!
- You set me up for it!

313
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,750
- It was perfect!
- That was pretty good.

314
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:04,949
You're okay.
He's with the Resistance.

315
00:36:06,155 --> 00:36:07,596
He's gonna get you home.

316
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:10,159
We both will.

317
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:16,923
I don't know your name.

318
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:20,559
Finn.
What's yours?

319
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:22,726
I'm Rey.

320
00:36:27,355 --> 00:36:28,455
Rey...

321
00:36:29,696 --> 00:36:31,431
Help me with this! Quick!

322
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,457
What's going on?

323
00:36:44,394 --> 00:36:48,101
Sir. We were unable to
acquire the droid on Jakku.

324
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,787
It escaped capture aboard a
stolen Corellian YT model freighter.

325
00:36:55,871 --> 00:36:59,639
<i>The droid... stole a freighter?</i>

326
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,140
Not exactly, sir.

327
00:37:01,894 --> 00:37:03,349
It had help.

328
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:11,386
We have no confirmation but we believe
FN-2187 may have helped in the escape.

329
00:37:28,495 --> 00:37:29,895
<i>Anything else?</i>

330
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:34,602
The two were accompanied by a girl.

331
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:41,056
<i>What girl?</i>

332
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:46,784
It's the motivator!
Grab me a Harris wrench... check in there!

333
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:47,662
How bad is it?

334
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:49,228
If we wanna live, not good!

335
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:51,672
They're hunting for us now.
We gotta get outta this system!

336
00:37:51,673 --> 00:37:54,357
BB-8 said the location of the
Resistance base is "need to know".

337
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:56,058
If I'm taking you there,
I need to know.

338
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,159
This?

339
00:37:58,392 --> 00:38:00,409
You gotta tell us where your base is.

340
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:02,785
I don't speak that.

341
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:06,419
All right, between us,
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

342
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,979
I'm just trying to get away
from the First Order.

343
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,019
But you tell us where the base is,
I'll get you there first.

344
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,880
Deal?

345
00:38:12,881 --> 00:38:14,050
Droid, please!

346
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:15,566
Pilex driver, hurry.

347
00:38:15,724 --> 00:38:18,248
- So where's your base?
- Go on BB-8, tell her.

348
00:38:21,605 --> 00:38:22,705
Please...

349
00:38:24,412 --> 00:38:27,451
- The Ileenium system?
- Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one.

350
00:38:27,452 --> 00:38:28,804
Get us there as fast as you can.

351
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:31,567
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

352
00:38:31,568 --> 00:38:32,470
What about you?

353
00:38:32,471 --> 00:38:33,904
I've gotta get back to Jakku!

354
00:38:33,987 --> 00:38:36,587
Back to Jak...?
Why does everyone wanna go back to Jakku?

355
00:38:36,604 --> 00:38:37,152
No, that one!

356
00:38:37,153 --> 00:38:39,217
- That place is...
- No. No.

357
00:38:39,218 --> 00:38:40,341
The one I'm pointing to.

358
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:42,620
No. No. No.

359
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:45,148
If we don't patch this up, the
propulsion tank will overflow...

360
00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:46,993
and flood the ship with poisonous gas!

361
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:47,894
- This?
- Yes!

362
00:38:50,025 --> 00:38:54,070
Rey. You're a pilot.
You can fly anywhere. Why go back?

363
00:38:54,271 --> 00:38:55,371
You got a family?

364
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:56,975
Got a boyfriend?
Cute boyfriend?

365
00:38:56,976 --> 00:38:58,540
None of your business, that's why!

366
00:39:00,594 --> 00:39:02,430
- That can't be good.
- No, it can't be.

367
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:11,249
Someone's locked onto us.
All controls are overridden.

368
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:19,108
Get off, get off!

369
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,705
See anything?

370
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,460
Oh no...

371
00:39:32,574 --> 00:39:33,874
It's the First Order.

372
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,019
What do we do?
There must be something.

373
00:39:36,353 --> 00:39:38,268
- You said poisonous gas.
- I fixed that.

374
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:39,469
Can you unfix it?

375
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,362
C'mon BB-8.

376
00:39:46,763 --> 00:39:47,843
I got him.

377
00:39:50,844 --> 00:39:53,844
<i>I'm okay.
BB-8 get off me...</i>

378
00:39:56,689 --> 00:39:58,434
Do you think this'll work
on the Stormtroopers?

379
00:39:58,435 --> 00:40:01,404
Yeah. Their masks filter
out smoke, not toxins.

380
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:10,352
- Hurry!
- <i>I'm hurrying.</i>

381
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,156
Chewie...

382
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,880
We're home.

383
00:40:41,423 --> 00:40:43,527
Where are the others?
Where's the pilot?

384
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:45,615
- <i>I'm the pilot.</i>
- You?

385
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:48,000
<i>No, it's true.
We're the only ones on board.</i>

386
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:49,155
<i>You can understand that thing?</i>

387
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:51,704
And "that thing" can
understand you too, so watch it.

388
00:40:51,705 --> 00:40:52,790
Come on outta there.

389
00:40:54,258 --> 00:40:56,527
- Where'd you get this ship?
- Niima Outpost.

390
00:40:56,528 --> 00:40:58,681
Jakku? That junkyard?

391
00:40:58,682 --> 00:41:00,082
Thank you!
Junkyard...

392
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,363
Told you we should've
double-checked the Western Reaches.

393
00:41:02,487 --> 00:41:04,351
Who had it, Ducain?

394
00:41:04,352 --> 00:41:06,330
I stole it, from Unkar Plutt.

395
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,671
He stole it from the Irving boys,
who stole it from Ducain.

396
00:41:08,672 --> 00:41:10,707
Who stole it from me!

397
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:14,951
Well you tell him that Han Solo just stole
back the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> for good.

398
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:18,135
This is the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>?
You're Han Solo?

399
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:20,914
I used to be.

400
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,383
Han Solo, the Rebellion General?

401
00:41:23,384 --> 00:41:25,040
No, the smuggler!

402
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,380
Wasn't he a war hero?

403
00:41:26,646 --> 00:41:29,833
This is the ship that made the
Kessel Run in 14 parsecs!

404
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:31,204
12!

405
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:33,809
14.

406
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,369
Hey...

407
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,101
Some moof-milker put a
compressor on the ignition line.

408
00:41:54,102 --> 00:41:55,008
Unkar Plutt did.

409
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:56,625
I thought it was a mistake too.
Puts too much...

410
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:58,681
- stress on the hyperdrive.
- Stress on the hyperdrive.

411
00:41:59,946 --> 00:42:01,510
Chewie, throw 'em in a pod.

412
00:42:01,511 --> 00:42:03,786
We'll drop them at the
nearest inhabited planet.

413
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:06,564
Wait, no!
We need your help.

414
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:07,712
My help?

415
00:42:07,713 --> 00:42:10,873
This droid has to get to the
Resistance base as soon as possible!

416
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:13,870
He's carrying a map to
Luke Skywalker.

417
00:42:18,377 --> 00:42:21,247
You are the Han Solo
that fought with the Rebellion.

418
00:42:27,204 --> 00:42:28,704
You knew him.

419
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:36,326
Yeah, I knew him.
I knew Luke.

420
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:41,915
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.

421
00:42:42,347 --> 00:42:43,547
Wait, what?

422
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:45,774
Did you just say Rathtar?

423
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:47,541
Hey!

424
00:42:47,577 --> 00:42:50,280
You're not hauling Rathtars
on this freighter, are you?

425
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,205
I'm hauling Rathtars.

426
00:42:52,796 --> 00:42:56,233
Oh great.
It's the Guavian Death Gang.

427
00:42:56,234 --> 00:42:58,154
Must've tracked
us from Nantoon.

428
00:42:58,155 --> 00:42:59,621
What's a Rathtar?

429
00:42:59,732 --> 00:43:01,206
They're big and they're dangerous.

430
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:02,881
You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?

431
00:43:02,882 --> 00:43:04,252
- No.
- Good.

432
00:43:04,253 --> 00:43:06,131
I got three of 'em going to King Prana.

433
00:43:06,132 --> 00:43:08,294
Three? How'd you get them on board?

434
00:43:08,408 --> 00:43:10,348
I used to have a bigger crew.

435
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,807
Get below and stay
there until I say so.

436
00:43:15,808 --> 00:43:17,619
And don't even think
about taking the <i>Falcon</i>.

437
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,529
What about BB-8?

438
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,146
He stays with me until I get rid of the gang.
Then you can have him back and be on your way.

439
00:43:22,147 --> 00:43:24,208
What about the Rathtars.
Where are you keeping them?

440
00:43:26,195 --> 00:43:27,295
There's one.

441
00:43:27,296 --> 00:43:28,529
What are you gonna do?

442
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:31,198
Same thing I always do.
Talk my way out of it.

443
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:34,220
Yes I do!
Every time.

444
00:43:51,415 --> 00:43:55,101
Han Solo.
You're a dead man.

445
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:57,953
Bala-Tik.
What's the problem?

446
00:43:58,086 --> 00:44:00,861
The problem is we
loaned you 50,000 for this job.

447
00:44:00,862 --> 00:44:02,124
Can you see them?

448
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,225
No.

449
00:44:03,442 --> 00:44:06,756
I heard you also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.

450
00:44:06,757 --> 00:44:09,138
You know you can't
trust those little freaks.

451
00:44:09,488 --> 00:44:11,027
<i>How long've we known each other?</i>

452
00:44:11,028 --> 00:44:12,152
<i>The question is how...</i>

453
00:44:12,153 --> 00:44:14,261
- They have blasters.
- A lot of them.

454
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:17,711
<i>... not long.</i>
We want our money back now.

455
00:44:17,712 --> 00:44:21,135
You think hunting Rathtars is cheap?
I spent that money.

456
00:44:21,136 --> 00:44:23,497
Kanjiklub wants their
investment back, too.

457
00:44:23,498 --> 00:44:25,955
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

458
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:27,910
Tell that to Kanjiklub.

459
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,831
Tasu Leech.
Good to see you.

460
00:44:40,842 --> 00:44:45,035
Wrong again, Solo.
It's over for you and your associate.

461
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:52,291
Boys. You're both gonna
get what I promised!

462
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:54,682
Have I ever not delivered for you before?

463
00:44:54,683 --> 00:44:55,383
Yeah.

464
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,017
Twice.

465
00:44:59,403 --> 00:45:00,936
What was the second time?

466
00:45:00,937 --> 00:45:02,237
Your game is old.

467
00:45:02,438 --> 00:45:05,232
There's no one in the galaxy
left for you to swindle.

468
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:07,035
Nowhere left for you to hide.

469
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:08,935
That BB unit...

470
00:45:08,936 --> 00:45:11,901
The First Order is looking
for one just like it.

471
00:45:15,221 --> 00:45:16,805
And two fugitives.

472
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,617
First I've heard of it.

473
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,235
Search the freighter.

474
00:45:27,213 --> 00:45:28,313
Wait wait...

475
00:45:31,781 --> 00:45:35,045
If we close the blast doors in that
corridor, we can trap both gangs.

476
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:36,569
We'll close the blast doors from here?

477
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,285
Resetting the fuses should do it.

478
00:45:46,305 --> 00:45:48,339
I got a bad feeling about this.

479
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,235
Oh no.

480
00:45:49,236 --> 00:45:50,236
Oh no, what?

481
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,384
Wrong fuses.

482
00:45:52,385 --> 00:45:53,585
Kill them!

483
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,871
And take the droid!

484
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:21,663
This was a mistake!

485
00:46:21,664 --> 00:46:22,664
Huge!

486
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,880
What do they look like?

487
00:46:42,828 --> 00:46:44,113
They look like that.

488
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,137
- This way.
- Are you sure?

489
00:46:50,461 --> 00:46:51,728
No! No!

490
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:53,744
Finn!

491
00:46:55,253 --> 00:46:56,253
Finn!

492
00:46:58,018 --> 00:46:59,018
Rey!

493
00:47:08,298 --> 00:47:09,485
Rey run!

494
00:47:09,486 --> 00:47:10,586
Finn!

495
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:13,046
Finn!

496
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:14,869
<i>Get off me!</i>

497
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,441
<i>Rey!</i>

498
00:47:33,081 --> 00:47:34,480
Get off! Get off!

499
00:47:36,822 --> 00:47:37,822
Finn!

500
00:47:38,987 --> 00:47:40,453
It had me! But the door...

501
00:47:40,454 --> 00:47:41,554
That was lucky!

502
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:46,997
I got the door.
Cover us!

503
00:47:55,448 --> 00:47:56,448
Chewie!

504
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:00,210
You okay?

505
00:48:01,931 --> 00:48:02,958
Wow.

506
00:48:05,247 --> 00:48:06,561
Come on, come on!

507
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:13,236
- Han.
- You, close the door behind us.

508
00:48:13,237 --> 00:48:14,712
You, take care of Chewie.

509
00:48:22,322 --> 00:48:23,615
Hey, where are you going?

510
00:48:23,616 --> 00:48:27,138
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too.
If we don't prime that we're not going anywhere.

511
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:28,439
I hate that guy.

512
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,223
- And you could use a co-pilot.
- I got one, he's back there.

513
00:48:33,407 --> 00:48:35,835
Watch the thrust.
We're going outta here at lightspeed.

514
00:48:35,836 --> 00:48:37,475
From inside the hangar?
Is that even possible?

515
00:48:37,476 --> 00:48:39,901
I never ask that question
until after I've done it.

516
00:48:41,826 --> 00:48:44,188
This is not how I thought
this day was gonna go.

517
00:48:44,189 --> 00:48:46,290
Angle the shields.
Hang on back there!

518
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,535
No problem!

519
00:48:57,317 --> 00:48:58,957
Come on baby, don't let me down!

520
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:01,847
What?

521
00:49:01,848 --> 00:49:03,148
Compressor.

522
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:14,689
Inform the First Order that
Han Solo has the droid they want.

523
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,917
And it's aboard the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.

524
00:49:25,658 --> 00:49:30,303
The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance.

525
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:35,100
Leading them to the last Jedi.

526
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:40,013
If Skywalker returns...

527
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:44,706
...the new Jedi will rise.

528
00:49:45,636 --> 00:49:47,545
Supreme Leader,
I take full responsibil...

529
00:49:47,546 --> 00:49:49,440
General!

530
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:54,173
Our strategy must now change.

531
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:56,392
The weapon.
It is ready.

532
00:49:56,814 --> 00:49:58,614
I believe the time has come to use it.

533
00:49:58,815 --> 00:50:01,619
We shall destroy the government
that supports the Resistance.

534
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,074
The Republic.

535
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:06,635
Without their friends to protect them,
the Resistance will be vulnerable.

536
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,694
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.

537
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:10,999
Go.

538
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:13,370
Oversee preparations.

539
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:15,166
Yes, Supreme Leader.

540
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,724
There has been an awakening.

541
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:25,712
Have you felt it?

542
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:28,527
<i>Yes.</i>

543
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,521
There's something more.

544
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:37,312
The droid we seek
is aboard the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.

545
00:50:37,896 --> 00:50:40,769
In the hands of your father...

546
00:50:41,187 --> 00:50:44,728
Han Solo.

547
00:50:47,332 --> 00:50:49,348
<i>He means nothing to me.</i>

548
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:54,833
Even you, master of the
Knights of Ren...

549
00:50:55,334 --> 00:50:58,578
...have never faced such a test.

550
00:50:59,117 --> 00:51:02,736
<i>By the grace of your training,
I will not be seduced.</i>

551
00:51:03,592 --> 00:51:05,269
We shall see.

552
00:51:08,025 --> 00:51:10,809
We shall see...

553
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:19,169
Electrical overload!

554
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,237
I can fix that!

555
00:51:20,538 --> 00:51:21,838
The coolant's leaking.

556
00:51:22,796 --> 00:51:24,271
Try transferring auxiliary power...

557
00:51:24,272 --> 00:51:25,627
- to secondary tank.
- To secondary tank.

558
00:51:25,628 --> 00:51:26,528
I got it.

559
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,997
Chewie, come on!

560
00:51:30,714 --> 00:51:32,834
I need help with
this giant hairy thing!

561
00:51:32,835 --> 00:51:33,922
Stop moving!

562
00:51:35,254 --> 00:51:36,154
Chewie...

563
00:51:37,117 --> 00:51:39,585
You hurt Chewie,
you're gonna deal with me!

564
00:51:39,586 --> 00:51:41,769
Hurt him?
He almost killed me six times!

565
00:51:42,694 --> 00:51:43,777
Which is fine.

566
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:47,646
This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be
pieces of us in three different systems.

567
00:51:50,856 --> 00:51:52,156
What'd you do?

568
00:51:52,872 --> 00:51:54,945
I by-passed the compressor.

569
00:51:57,769 --> 00:51:58,769
Huh...

570
00:52:01,602 --> 00:52:02,846
Move, ball.

571
00:52:05,152 --> 00:52:08,994
Nah, don't say that.
You did great, just rest.

572
00:52:09,532 --> 00:52:10,993
Good job, kid.

573
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,512
Thanks.

574
00:52:12,513 --> 00:52:13,813
You're welcome.

575
00:52:18,613 --> 00:52:19,931
So...

576
00:52:20,164 --> 00:52:21,893
Fugitives, huh?

577
00:52:23,569 --> 00:52:24,892
The First Order wants the map.

578
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:26,493
Finn is with the Resistance.

579
00:52:26,915 --> 00:52:28,495
I'm just a scavenger.

580
00:52:30,245 --> 00:52:31,945
Let's see what you got.

581
00:52:32,803 --> 00:52:33,939
Go ahead.

582
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:47,068
This map's not complete.
It's just a piece.

583
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:51,690
Ever since Luke disappeared,
people have been looking for him.

584
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:53,798
Why did he leave?

585
00:52:54,941 --> 00:52:57,835
He was training
a new generation of Jedi.

586
00:52:57,836 --> 00:53:01,984
One boy, an apprentice
turned against him, destroyed it all.

587
00:53:03,508 --> 00:53:08,408
Luke felt responsible.
He just walked away from everything.

588
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,352
Do you know what happened to him?

589
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,011
A lot of rumors. Stories.

590
00:53:14,643 --> 00:53:16,795
People who knew him best...

591
00:53:18,557 --> 00:53:21,082
think he went looking for
the first Jedi Temple.

592
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,910
The Jedi were real.

593
00:53:23,911 --> 00:53:28,584
I used to wonder about that myself.
Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.

594
00:53:29,278 --> 00:53:34,162
A magical power holding together good
and evil, the Dark Side and the Light.

595
00:53:35,455 --> 00:53:37,397
The crazy thing is...

596
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:41,658
...it's true.

597
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:45,963
The Force, the Jedi.

598
00:53:48,336 --> 00:53:49,611
All of it.

599
00:53:52,275 --> 00:53:53,889
It's all true.

600
00:53:57,875 --> 00:53:59,402
No, you rest.

601
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,145
You want my help?
You're getting it.

602
00:54:02,146 --> 00:54:04,846
Gonna see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.

603
00:54:05,468 --> 00:54:06,808
This is our stop.

604
00:54:24,175 --> 00:54:27,366
I didn't know there was this
much green in the whole galaxy.

605
00:54:54,943 --> 00:54:57,452
Hey Solo. I'm not sure
what we're walking into here.

606
00:54:57,453 --> 00:54:58,654
Did you just call me "Solo"?

607
00:54:58,855 --> 00:55:00,604
Sorry. Han... Mr. Solo.

608
00:55:00,605 --> 00:55:03,812
You should know, I'm
a big deal in the Resistance.

609
00:55:04,113 --> 00:55:06,324
Which puts a real target on my back.

610
00:55:06,348 --> 00:55:08,248
Are there any conspirators here?

611
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:10,510
Like... First Order sympathizers?

612
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:14,766
Listen big deal.
You got another problem.

613
00:55:15,017 --> 00:55:17,373
Women always figure out the truth.

614
00:55:18,852 --> 00:55:20,277
Always.

615
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,703
You might need this.

616
00:55:28,899 --> 00:55:30,546
I think I can handle myself.

617
00:55:30,642 --> 00:55:32,635
I know you do.
That's why I'm giving it to you.

618
00:55:33,336 --> 00:55:34,435
Take it.

619
00:55:36,589 --> 00:55:37,951
You know how to use one of those?

620
00:55:37,952 --> 00:55:39,546
Yeah, you pull the trigger.

621
00:55:39,647 --> 00:55:41,660
Little bit more to it than that.

622
00:55:42,014 --> 00:55:43,781
You got a lot to learn.

623
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:46,507
You got a name?

624
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,199
Rey.

625
00:55:49,003 --> 00:55:50,203
Rey.

626
00:55:54,033 --> 00:55:56,391
I've been thinking about
bringing on some more crew, Rey.

627
00:55:56,392 --> 00:55:58,266
A second mate.
Someone to help out.

628
00:55:58,267 --> 00:56:01,654
Someone who can keep up with Chewie
and me, and appreciates the <i>Falcon</i>.

629
00:56:01,655 --> 00:56:03,368
Are you offering me a job?

630
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:06,314
I wouldn't be nice to you.
It doesn't pay much.

631
00:56:06,315 --> 00:56:08,060
You're offering me a job.

632
00:56:09,376 --> 00:56:10,961
I'm thinking about it.

633
00:56:14,332 --> 00:56:15,498
Well?

634
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:23,298
If you were, I'd be flattered.
But I have to get home.

635
00:56:23,786 --> 00:56:25,638
Where, Jakku?

636
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,389
I've already been away too long.

637
00:56:29,293 --> 00:56:32,279
Chewie, check out
the ship as best you can.

638
00:56:35,467 --> 00:56:38,444
It's too bad.
Chewie kind of likes you.

639
00:56:41,573 --> 00:56:43,342
Solo, why are we here again?

640
00:56:43,343 --> 00:56:45,068
To get your droid
on a clean ship.

641
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:45,932
Clean?

642
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:48,939
Do you think it was luck that
Chewie and I found the <i>Falcon</i>?

643
00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:53,335
If we can find it on our scanners,
the First Order's not far behind.

644
00:56:53,336 --> 00:56:58,687
Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance?
Maz Kanata is our best bet.

645
00:56:59,103 --> 00:57:00,724
We can trust her, right?

646
00:57:00,725 --> 00:57:01,925
Relax, kid.

647
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,214
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.

648
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:09,354
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste,
so let me do the talking.

649
00:57:09,355 --> 00:57:11,136
And whatever you do, don't stare.

650
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,337
At what?

651
00:57:13,135 --> 00:57:14,447
Any of it.

652
00:57:35,283 --> 00:57:37,685
Han Solo!

653
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:42,831
Oh boy...

654
00:57:43,432 --> 00:57:44,716
Hey, Maz!

655
00:57:48,012 --> 00:57:49,944
Where's my boyfriend?

656
00:57:50,295 --> 00:57:52,079
Chewie's working
on the <i>Falcon</i>.

657
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,423
I like that Wookiee.

658
00:57:53,646 --> 00:57:57,314
I assume you need something.
Desperately.

659
00:57:57,315 --> 00:57:58,368
Let's get to it.

660
00:58:23,808 --> 00:58:25,669
Alert the Resistance.

661
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,288
Their missing droid is here!

662
00:58:33,494 --> 00:58:37,615
Inform the First Order...
I've found the droid.

663
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,472
<i>Forgive me.</i>

664
00:58:56,971 --> 00:58:58,873
<i>I feel it again.</i>

665
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:04,192
<i>The pull to the Light.</i>

666
00:59:06,763 --> 00:59:09,346
<i>Supreme Leader senses it.</i>

667
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:11,554
<i>Show me again...</i>

668
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,291
<i>the power of the Darkness.</i>

669
00:59:15,584 --> 00:59:18,289
<i>And I will let nothing
stand in our way.</i>

670
00:59:19,072 --> 00:59:20,691
<i>Show me...</i>

671
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,423
<i>grandfather...</i>

672
00:59:26,584 --> 00:59:30,914
<i>And I will finish what you started.</i>

673
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:44,871
A map.

674
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,077
To Skywalker himself?

675
00:59:47,078 --> 00:59:47,450
You're right back in the mess.

676
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:49,998
Maz, I need you to get
this droid to Leia.

677
00:59:52,257 --> 00:59:53,057
No.

678
00:59:54,292 --> 00:59:58,724
You've been running away
from this fight for too long.

679
00:59:58,925 --> 00:59:59,978
Han.

680
01:00:00,178 --> 01:00:02,484
Nyakee nago wadda.

681
01:00:02,584 --> 01:00:04,025
Go home!

682
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:06,460
Leia doesn't wanna see me.

683
01:00:06,461 --> 01:00:08,662
Please, we came here for your help.

684
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,810
What fight?

685
01:00:11,722 --> 01:00:13,600
The only fight.

686
01:00:13,601 --> 01:00:15,740
Against the Dark Side.

687
01:00:16,035 --> 01:00:20,235
Through the ages, I've seen evil
take many forms.

688
01:00:20,876 --> 01:00:23,206
The Sith. The Empire.

689
01:00:23,238 --> 01:00:26,581
Today, it is the First Order.

690
01:00:26,898 --> 01:00:30,119
Their shadow is spreading
across the galaxy.

691
01:00:30,195 --> 01:00:31,747
We must face them.

692
01:00:31,748 --> 01:00:33,739
Fight them.

693
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:35,572
All of us.

694
01:00:36,004 --> 01:00:37,668
There is no fight
against the First Order!

695
01:00:37,669 --> 01:00:39,026
Not one we can win.

696
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:41,196
Look around.

697
01:00:41,197 --> 01:00:43,732
There's no chance we haven't
been recognized already.

698
01:00:43,733 --> 01:00:46,180
I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...

699
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,720
What's this?

700
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:51,190
What are you doing?

701
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,785
Solo, what is she doing?

702
01:00:57,786 --> 01:00:59,374
I don't know, but it ain't good.

703
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:04,718
If you live long enough you see
the same eyes in different people.

704
01:01:05,387 --> 01:01:10,133
I'm looking at the eyes
of a man who wants to run.

705
01:01:13,244 --> 01:01:15,286
You don't know a thing about me.

706
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:19,331
Where I'm from.
What I've seen.

707
01:01:20,063 --> 01:01:22,748
You don't know the
First Order like I do.

708
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:24,861
They'll slaughter us.

709
01:01:25,673 --> 01:01:27,869
We all need to run.

710
01:01:36,632 --> 01:01:37,832
You see those two?

711
01:01:38,135 --> 01:01:40,932
They'll trade work for
transportation to the Outer Rim.

712
01:01:41,276 --> 01:01:43,603
There, you can disappear.

713
01:01:44,135 --> 01:01:45,035
Finn!

714
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:48,283
Come with me.

715
01:01:48,968 --> 01:01:51,494
What about BB-8?
We're not done yet.

716
01:01:51,495 --> 01:01:53,370
We have to get him back to your base.

717
01:01:57,906 --> 01:01:59,231
I can't.

718
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,483
Keep it, kid.

719
01:02:19,417 --> 01:02:21,506
Who's the girl?

720
01:02:25,878 --> 01:02:28,198
I was told you can get
me to the Outer Rim.

721
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:29,532
What are you doing?

722
01:02:30,783 --> 01:02:32,297
Don't leave without me.

723
01:02:35,716 --> 01:02:37,676
You can't just go.
I won't let you.

724
01:02:37,677 --> 01:02:38,986
I'm not who you think I am.

725
01:02:38,987 --> 01:02:40,187
Finn, what are you talking about?

726
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:41,200
I'm not Resistance.

727
01:02:41,685 --> 01:02:43,209
I'm not a hero.

728
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:48,065
I'm a Stormtrooper.

729
01:02:49,311 --> 01:02:52,942
Like all of them, I was taken
from a family I'll never know.

730
01:02:52,962 --> 01:02:55,080
And raised to do one thing.

731
01:02:55,712 --> 01:02:58,889
But my first battle,
I made a choice.

732
01:02:59,948 --> 01:03:01,931
I wasn't gonna kill for them.

733
01:03:02,422 --> 01:03:05,372
So I ran.
Right into you.

734
01:03:07,259 --> 01:03:09,645
And you looked at me
like no one ever had.

735
01:03:12,048 --> 01:03:14,217
I was ashamed of what I was.

736
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:18,888
But I'm done with the First Order.

737
01:03:18,889 --> 01:03:20,849
I'm never going back.

738
01:03:22,696 --> 01:03:24,955
Rey, come with me.

739
01:03:25,497 --> 01:03:26,829
Don't go.

740
01:03:32,244 --> 01:03:34,013
Take care of yourself.

741
01:03:35,534 --> 01:03:37,163
Please.

742
01:03:50,982 --> 01:03:52,572
<i>No!</i>

743
01:03:53,023 --> 01:03:55,131
<i>No!</i>

744
01:04:08,033 --> 01:04:11,542
<i>No! Come back!</i>

745
01:04:12,274 --> 01:04:14,210
<i>No!</i>

746
01:04:30,359 --> 01:04:32,112
<i>Come back!</i>

747
01:04:42,532 --> 01:04:44,447
<i>No!</i>

748
01:05:35,317 --> 01:05:36,696
<i>No!</i>

749
01:05:37,179 --> 01:05:38,819
<i>It's energy...</i>

750
01:05:42,436 --> 01:05:44,077
<i>Nooo!</i>

751
01:05:44,078 --> 01:05:46,861
<i>...surrounds us, and binds us.</i>

752
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:06,448
<i>No!</i>

753
01:06:06,584 --> 01:06:08,569
Come back!

754
01:06:08,937 --> 01:06:10,367
Quiet, girl.

755
01:06:11,254 --> 01:06:12,554
No!

756
01:06:16,653 --> 01:06:17,753
<i>Rey?</i>

757
01:06:21,786 --> 01:06:25,268
<i>These are your first steps...</i>

758
01:06:30,163 --> 01:06:31,263
What was that?

759
01:06:33,309 --> 01:06:34,903
I shouldn't have gone in there.

760
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:39,710
That lightsaber was Luke's.

761
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:41,427
And his father's before him.

762
01:06:41,578 --> 01:06:44,977
And now, it calls to you!

763
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,925
I have to get back to Jakku.

764
01:06:47,513 --> 01:06:49,185
Han told me.

765
01:06:57,094 --> 01:06:58,774
Dear child.

766
01:06:59,094 --> 01:07:00,674
I see your eyes.

767
01:07:01,024 --> 01:07:03,599
You already know the truth.

768
01:07:04,225 --> 01:07:07,147
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku...

769
01:07:08,123 --> 01:07:10,227
...they're never coming back.

770
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:20,011
But... there's someone
who still could.

771
01:07:22,303 --> 01:07:23,746
Luke.

772
01:07:24,051 --> 01:07:27,827
The belonging you seek
is not behind you.

773
01:07:27,828 --> 01:07:29,385
It is ahead.

774
01:07:29,486 --> 01:07:32,943
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.

775
01:07:33,128 --> 01:07:37,773
It moves through and
surrounds every living thing.

776
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:41,433
Close your eyes.

777
01:07:43,238 --> 01:07:44,438
Feel it.

778
01:07:45,319 --> 01:07:47,132
The Light.

779
01:07:47,533 --> 01:07:50,005
It's always been there.

780
01:07:50,102 --> 01:07:52,071
It will guide you.

781
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:56,781
The saber. Take it.

782
01:08:00,271 --> 01:08:04,435
I'm never touching that thing again.
I don't want any part of this.

783
01:08:30,014 --> 01:08:34,458
<i>Today is the end of the Republic!</i>

784
01:08:35,849 --> 01:08:41,454
<i>The end of a regime
that acquiesces to disorder!</i>

785
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:46,490
<i>At this very moment,
in a system far from here...</i>

786
01:08:46,491 --> 01:08:51,416
<i>The New Republic
lies to the galaxy...</i>

787
01:08:51,593 --> 01:08:55,815
<i>While secretly
supporting the treachery...</i>

788
01:08:56,046 --> 01:08:59,080
<i>Of the loathsome Resistance.</i>

789
01:08:59,589 --> 01:09:02,667
<i>This fierce machine
which you have built...</i>

790
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:07,535
<i>Upon which we stand,
will bring an end to the Senate!</i>

791
01:09:07,536 --> 01:09:09,925
<i>To their cherished fleet!</i>

792
01:09:10,126 --> 01:09:14,958
<i>All remaining systems
will bow to the First Order!</i>

793
01:09:14,959 --> 01:09:17,290
<i>And will remember this...</i>

794
01:09:17,418 --> 01:09:22,535
<i>As the last day of the Republic!</i>

795
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:26,568
Confirm transfer to manual control.

796
01:09:26,869 --> 01:09:28,015
Configure!

797
01:09:28,523 --> 01:09:30,083
<i>Fire!</i>

798
01:10:30,431 --> 01:10:31,817
What is it...?

799
01:10:48,312 --> 01:10:49,900
It was the Republic.

800
01:10:50,685 --> 01:10:52,680
The First Order,
they've done it.

801
01:10:54,581 --> 01:10:56,024
Where's Rey?

802
01:11:13,028 --> 01:11:14,624
What are you doing?

803
01:11:16,344 --> 01:11:18,028
You have to go back.

804
01:11:18,624 --> 01:11:19,824
I'm leaving.

805
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:21,812
BB-8.

806
01:11:22,358 --> 01:11:25,211
No, you can't. You have to go back.
You're too important.

807
01:11:25,637 --> 01:11:27,338
They'll help you.

808
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:43,044
I've had this for ages.

809
01:11:46,698 --> 01:11:48,345
Kept it locked away.

810
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:49,969
Where'd you get that?

811
01:11:50,863 --> 01:11:54,001
A good question... for another time.

812
01:11:54,714 --> 01:11:57,832
Take it! Find your friend!

813
01:12:04,832 --> 01:12:08,235
Those beasts! They're here!

814
01:12:31,923 --> 01:12:34,466
<i>FN-417, hold position!</i>

815
01:12:36,884 --> 01:12:37,960
Oh, safety.

816
01:13:03,803 --> 01:13:04,600
<i>Sir.</i>

817
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:07,770
<i>The droid was spotted heading west,
with a girl.</i>

818
01:13:12,461 --> 01:13:14,883
You have to keep going.
Stay out of sight.

819
01:13:15,484 --> 01:13:17,188
I'll try to fight 'em off.

820
01:13:17,956 --> 01:13:19,308
I hope so, too.

821
01:13:31,934 --> 01:13:33,178
Come on, Chewie!

822
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,795
Rey and BB-8, they need you.
Now go!

823
01:13:39,996 --> 01:13:41,359
I need a weapon!

824
01:13:41,552 --> 01:13:43,131
You have one!

825
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:54,804
Hey, can I try that?

826
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,424
I like this thing.

827
01:14:09,228 --> 01:14:10,640
<i>Traitor!</i>

828
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:56,130
You okay, big deal?

829
01:14:56,231 --> 01:14:57,133
Thanks!

830
01:14:57,334 --> 01:14:58,534
<i>Don't move!</i>

831
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:02,129
<i>TK-338, we have targets in custody!</i>

832
01:15:07,534 --> 01:15:09,813
<i>We have incoming at 28.6.</i>

833
01:15:09,814 --> 01:15:12,611
<i>Move! Dispatch! Move!
GO, go, go!</i>

834
01:15:12,612 --> 01:15:15,624
<i>Scramble all squads!
Repeat, scramble all squads!</i>

835
01:15:15,827 --> 01:15:18,107
<i>Anti-air cover
en route to our position!</i>

836
01:15:20,111 --> 01:15:21,806
It's the Resistance.

837
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:32,350
Go straight ahead and
don't let these dogs scare you!

838
01:15:32,373 --> 01:15:34,073
<i>- Copy that!
- We're with you, Poe!</i>

839
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:03,411
Quick!

840
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:33,685
Yeah!

841
01:16:34,417 --> 01:16:36,451
That's one hell of a pilot!

842
01:17:31,886 --> 01:17:34,273
<i>The girl I've heard so much about.</i>

843
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,927
<i>The droid...</i>

844
01:17:50,275 --> 01:17:52,075
<i>Where is it?</i>

845
01:17:56,988 --> 01:17:58,717
<i>Request air support!</i>

846
01:18:05,908 --> 01:18:06,931
<i>The map.</i>

847
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:10,639
<i>You've seen it.</i>

848
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:13,648
<i>Sir, Resistance fighters!</i>

849
01:18:14,406 --> 01:18:15,905
<i>We need more troops.</i>

850
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:17,304
<i>Pull the division out.</i>

851
01:18:18,246 --> 01:18:21,405
<i>Forget the droid.
We have what we need.</i>

852
01:18:27,925 --> 01:18:29,350
<i>Pull back the tree line!</i>

853
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:45,570
No!

854
01:18:49,744 --> 01:18:51,487
No! No, no!

855
01:18:53,258 --> 01:18:55,990
No! No!

856
01:18:56,996 --> 01:18:58,796
Rey!

857
01:19:17,133 --> 01:19:19,317
He took her! Did you see that?

858
01:19:19,869 --> 01:19:21,425
He took her. She's gone!

859
01:19:21,534 --> 01:19:22,867
Yeah, yeah, I know...

860
01:19:32,326 --> 01:19:33,226
<i>Let's go.</i>

861
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:48,062
Goodness!

862
01:19:48,315 --> 01:19:51,971
Han Solo!
It is I, C-3PO!

863
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:55,104
You probably don't recognize
me because of the red arm.

864
01:19:55,316 --> 01:19:57,701
Look who it is!
Did you see who?

865
01:20:02,059 --> 01:20:04,892
Excuse me, Prin... uh, General.
Sorry.

866
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:06,790
Come along, BB-8. Quickly.

867
01:20:07,468 --> 01:20:10,311
Yes, I must get
my proper arm reinstalled.

868
01:20:12,172 --> 01:20:13,808
You changed your hair.

869
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:17,613
Same jacket.

870
01:20:19,003 --> 01:20:20,911
No, new jacket.

871
01:20:33,857 --> 01:20:35,240
I saw him.

872
01:20:36,447 --> 01:20:38,564
Leia, I saw our son.

873
01:20:40,386 --> 01:20:41,886
He was here.

874
01:21:22,552 --> 01:21:23,452
Hey!

875
01:21:27,911 --> 01:21:29,724
BB-8, my buddy.

876
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:31,876
Oh, it's so good to see you.

877
01:21:31,888 --> 01:21:34,188
Finn saved you?
Where is he?

878
01:21:34,597 --> 01:21:35,597
Poe?

879
01:21:37,424 --> 01:21:38,324
Oh no.

880
01:21:38,325 --> 01:21:40,127
Poe Dameron, you're alive?

881
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:42,688
- So are you!
- What happened to you?

882
01:21:42,762 --> 01:21:45,855
I got thrown from the crash, I woke up
at night... no you, no ship, nothing.

883
01:21:45,856 --> 01:21:47,528
BB-8 says that you saved him.

884
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:48,818
No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

885
01:21:48,819 --> 01:21:52,167
You completed my mission, Finn.
That's my jacket.

886
01:21:53,025 --> 01:21:54,359
No, no, no, no.

887
01:21:54,605 --> 01:21:56,072
Keep it. It suits you.

888
01:21:57,096 --> 01:21:58,896
You're a good man, Finn.

889
01:21:59,538 --> 01:22:01,511
Poe, I need your help.

890
01:22:02,863 --> 01:22:05,855
<i>PZ-4CO, report to
communications.</i>

891
01:22:09,235 --> 01:22:10,446
General Organa.

892
01:22:11,868 --> 01:22:14,081
Sorry to interrupt.
This is Finn.

893
01:22:14,091 --> 01:22:15,225
He needs to talk to you.

894
01:22:15,226 --> 01:22:16,828
And I need to talk to him.

895
01:22:17,007 --> 01:22:19,032
That was incredibly brave, what you did.

896
01:22:19,033 --> 01:22:21,480
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.

897
01:22:21,481 --> 01:22:23,604
Thank you, ma'am...
but a friend of mine was taken prisoner.

898
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,092
Han told me about the girl.

899
01:22:25,692 --> 01:22:26,520
I'm sorry.

900
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:29,000
Finn's familiar with the weapon
that destroyed the Hosnian System.

901
01:22:29,001 --> 01:22:30,161
He worked on the base.

902
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:32,371
We're desperate for
anything you can tell us.

903
01:22:32,372 --> 01:22:34,894
That's where my friend was taken.
I've got to get there, fast.

904
01:22:34,895 --> 01:22:39,248
And I will do everything I can to help,
but first you need to tell us all you know.

905
01:22:42,005 --> 01:22:43,997
That sounds very scary.

906
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:48,419
You must be so brave.

907
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:56,597
General, I regret to inform you, but this map
recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete.

908
01:22:56,598 --> 01:23:00,347
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.

909
01:23:00,348 --> 01:23:04,596
We simply do not have enough
information to locate Master Luke.

910
01:23:04,797 --> 01:23:08,695
I can't believe I was so foolish to think
I could find Luke and bring him home.

911
01:23:08,796 --> 01:23:09,321
Leia...

912
01:23:09,722 --> 01:23:10,759
Don't do that.

913
01:23:10,973 --> 01:23:11,913
Do what?

914
01:23:12,014 --> 01:23:13,145
Anything.

915
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:15,710
Princesses.

916
01:23:17,136 --> 01:23:18,654
I'm trying to be helpful!

917
01:23:19,459 --> 01:23:22,254
When did that ever help?
And don't say the Death Star.

918
01:23:37,655 --> 01:23:38,755
BB-8.

919
01:23:38,783 --> 01:23:40,516
You're wasting your time.

920
01:23:41,341 --> 01:23:45,328
It is very doubtful that R2 would have
the rest of the map in his backup data.

921
01:23:45,973 --> 01:23:47,083
I am afraid not.

922
01:23:47,084 --> 01:23:51,262
R2-D2 has been in low power mode
ever since Master Luke went away.

923
01:23:53,835 --> 01:23:56,829
Sadly, he may never be his old self again.

924
01:23:58,705 --> 01:23:59,969
Listen to me, will you?

925
01:24:01,773 --> 01:24:03,298
I know every time you...

926
01:24:05,848 --> 01:24:08,381
Every time you look at me,
you're reminded of him.

927
01:24:08,382 --> 01:24:10,318
You think I want to forget him?

928
01:24:10,419 --> 01:24:12,131
I want him back!

929
01:24:12,132 --> 01:24:14,219
There's nothing more we could have done.

930
01:24:16,069 --> 01:24:17,609
There's too much Vader in him.

931
01:24:17,610 --> 01:24:19,981
That's why I wanted
him to train with Luke.

932
01:24:20,857 --> 01:24:23,688
I just never should have sent him away.
That's when I lost him.

933
01:24:25,191 --> 01:24:27,024
That's when I lost you both.

934
01:24:29,328 --> 01:24:32,470
We both had to deal
with it in our own way.

935
01:24:32,893 --> 01:24:36,007
I went back to the only
thing I was ever any good at.

936
01:24:36,591 --> 01:24:37,938
We both did.

937
01:24:39,931 --> 01:24:42,768
We lost our son, forever.

938
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:44,105
No.

939
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,842
It was Snoke.

940
01:24:45,943 --> 01:24:48,732
He seduced our son to the Dark Side.

941
01:24:48,733 --> 01:24:50,791
But we can still save him.

942
01:24:50,999 --> 01:24:52,199
Me...

943
01:24:53,501 --> 01:24:54,701
You.

944
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,100
If Luke couldn't reach him,
how could I?

945
01:24:57,672 --> 01:24:59,160
Luke is a Jedi...

946
01:25:00,404 --> 01:25:01,904
You're his father.

947
01:25:04,774 --> 01:25:07,884
There's still Light in him.
I know it.

948
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,200
General.

949
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:13,264
The reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

950
01:25:39,499 --> 01:25:40,699
Where am I?

951
01:25:42,795 --> 01:25:43,975
<i>You're my guest.</i>

952
01:25:44,476 --> 01:25:45,487
Where are the others?

953
01:25:45,588 --> 01:25:50,684
<i>You mean the murderers, traitors
and thieves you call friends?</i>

954
01:25:51,378 --> 01:25:53,708
<i>You'll be relieved to hear
I have no idea.</i>

955
01:25:56,163 --> 01:25:57,984
<i>You still wanna kill me.</i>

956
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:02,066
That happens when you're being
hunted by a creature in a mask.

957
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:28,807
Tell me about the droid.

958
01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:33,105
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.

959
01:26:33,181 --> 01:26:35,351
He's carrying a section
of a navigational chart.

960
01:26:35,352 --> 01:26:36,858
And we have the rest.

961
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,889
Recovered from the archives of the Empire,
but we need the last piece.

962
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:42,358
And somehow you convinced
the droid to show it to you.

963
01:26:44,003 --> 01:26:44,903
You.

964
01:26:46,349 --> 01:26:47,681
A scavenger.

965
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,973
You know I can take
whatever I want.

966
01:26:58,051 --> 01:26:59,885
You're so lonely.

967
01:27:02,304 --> 01:27:03,633
So afraid to leave.

968
01:27:07,818 --> 01:27:10,784
At night, desperate to sleep.

969
01:27:13,963 --> 01:27:15,434
You imagine an ocean.

970
01:27:16,311 --> 01:27:17,611
I see it.

971
01:27:18,952 --> 01:27:20,728
I see the island.

972
01:27:25,207 --> 01:27:26,764
And Han Solo.

973
01:27:29,092 --> 01:27:30,996
You feel like he's the
father you never had.

974
01:27:31,844 --> 01:27:32,871
He would've disappointed you.

975
01:27:32,872 --> 01:27:34,600
Get out of my head.

976
01:27:35,623 --> 01:27:37,305
I know you've seen the map.

977
01:27:38,815 --> 01:27:40,202
It's in there.

978
01:27:40,789 --> 01:27:42,445
And now you'll give it to me.

979
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:52,925
Don't be afraid.
I feel it too.

980
01:27:55,484 --> 01:27:57,671
I'm not giving you anything.

981
01:27:58,571 --> 01:27:59,871
We'll see...

982
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:40,890
You...

983
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:43,249
You're afraid.

984
01:28:45,531 --> 01:28:49,001
That you will never be as
strong as Darth Vader.

985
01:28:57,531 --> 01:28:59,457
<i>The scavenger...</i>

986
01:28:59,719 --> 01:29:01,149
...resisted you?

987
01:29:01,265 --> 01:29:02,954
She is strong with the Force.

988
01:29:02,978 --> 01:29:04,825
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

989
01:29:04,826 --> 01:29:06,226
And the droid?

990
01:29:06,227 --> 01:29:09,166
Ren believed it was
no longer valuable to us.

991
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:12,306
That the girl was all we needed.

992
01:29:12,451 --> 01:29:16,207
As a result, the droid has most likely
been returned to the hands of the enemy.

993
01:29:16,208 --> 01:29:17,810
They may have the map already.

994
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:21,899
Then the Resistance must be
destroyed before they get to Skywalker.

995
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,557
We have their location.

996
01:29:23,721 --> 01:29:26,674
We tracked their reconnaissance
ship to the Ileenium system.

997
01:29:27,006 --> 01:29:28,406
Good.

998
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:31,739
Then we will crush
them once and for all.

999
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:33,557
Prepare the weapon.

1000
01:29:33,997 --> 01:29:36,568
Supreme Leader, I can get
the map from the girl.

1001
01:29:36,769 --> 01:29:38,713
I just need your guidance.

1002
01:29:40,261 --> 01:29:44,393
If what you say
about this girl is true...

1003
01:29:45,015 --> 01:29:49,418
...bring her to me.

1004
01:30:03,597 --> 01:30:09,097
You will remove these restraints
and leave this cell with the door open.

1005
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:14,044
<i>What did you say?</i>

1006
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:21,786
You will remove these restraints
and leave this cell with the door open.

1007
01:30:28,541 --> 01:30:32,135
<i>I'll tighten those restraints,
scavenger scum.</i>

1008
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:50,551
You will remove these restraints
and leave this cell with the door open.

1009
01:30:54,172 --> 01:30:57,810
<i>I will remove these restraints
and leave this cell with the door open.</i>

1010
01:31:06,534 --> 01:31:07,884
And you'll drop your weapon.

1011
01:31:07,931 --> 01:31:09,967
<i>And I'll drop my weapon.</i>

1012
01:31:22,322 --> 01:31:23,422
<i>No.</i>

1013
01:31:24,385 --> 01:31:25,585
<i>No.</i>

1014
01:31:27,108 --> 01:31:28,465
<i>Guards!</i>

1015
01:31:31,128 --> 01:31:32,428
<i>Guards!</i>

1016
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:38,728
Begin charging the weapon!

1017
01:31:39,438 --> 01:31:40,338
Yes, sir.

1018
01:31:40,813 --> 01:31:41,820
Weapon charging.

1019
01:32:00,976 --> 01:32:04,724
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance
flight confirms Finn's report.

1020
01:32:04,725 --> 01:32:08,448
They've somehow created a hyper-lightspeed
weapon built within the planet itself.

1021
01:32:08,549 --> 01:32:09,493
A laser cannon?

1022
01:32:09,494 --> 01:32:11,283
We're not sure how to
describe a weapon of this scale.

1023
01:32:11,384 --> 01:32:14,043
- It's another Death Star.
- I wish that were the case, Major.

1024
01:32:14,044 --> 01:32:16,043
This was the Death Star.

1025
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:20,984
And this is Starkiller Base.

1026
01:32:21,126 --> 01:32:22,510
So it's big.

1027
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:25,491
How is it possible to power
a weapon of that size?

1028
01:32:25,792 --> 01:32:28,020
It uses the power of the sun.

1029
01:32:28,965 --> 01:32:32,382
As the weapon is charged,
the sun is drained until it disappears.

1030
01:32:32,383 --> 01:32:33,296
Ma'am.

1031
01:32:35,324 --> 01:32:38,470
The First Order. They're
charging the weapon again now.

1032
01:32:39,249 --> 01:32:40,745
Our system is the next target.

1033
01:32:41,146 --> 01:32:43,912
Oh my. Without the Republic
fleet, we're doomed.

1034
01:32:44,043 --> 01:32:47,394
Okay, how do we blow it up?
There's always a way to do that.

1035
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:48,208
Han's right.

1036
01:32:48,209 --> 01:32:50,897
In order for that amount of
power to be contained...

1037
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:53,279
that base has to have some
kind of thermal oscillator.

1038
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,311
There is one.

1039
01:32:54,412 --> 01:32:56,837
Precinct 47. Here.

1040
01:32:57,261 --> 01:33:02,506
If we can destroy that oscillator, it might
de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon.

1041
01:33:02,557 --> 01:33:03,528
Maybe the planet.

1042
01:33:03,529 --> 01:33:05,871
We'll go in there and we'll hit that
oscillator with everything we've got.

1043
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:09,332
They have defensive shields
that our ships cannot penetrate.

1044
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:11,100
We disable the shields.

1045
01:33:11,201 --> 01:33:13,946
Kid, you worked there.
What do you got?

1046
01:33:14,047 --> 01:33:14,893
I can do it.

1047
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:16,321
I like this guy.

1048
01:33:16,322 --> 01:33:19,518
I can disable the shields.
But I have to be there, on the planet.

1049
01:33:19,817 --> 01:33:21,940
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?

1050
01:33:22,141 --> 01:33:24,201
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

1051
01:33:24,202 --> 01:33:25,362
So we disable the shields.

1052
01:33:25,373 --> 01:33:28,367
We take out the oscillator
and we blow up their big gun.

1053
01:33:29,406 --> 01:33:30,806
All right. Let's go!

1054
01:33:52,742 --> 01:33:55,644
Chewie, check that donal capitator.
Come on. Let's go.

1055
01:33:55,982 --> 01:33:58,348
Finn, be careful with those.
They're explosives.

1056
01:33:58,349 --> 01:33:59,521
Now you tell me?

1057
01:33:59,622 --> 01:34:02,298
You know, no matter
how much we faught...

1058
01:34:03,863 --> 01:34:06,042
I've always hated watching you leave.

1059
01:34:06,551 --> 01:34:07,799
That's why I did it.

1060
01:34:09,074 --> 01:34:10,772
So you'd miss me.

1061
01:34:13,175 --> 01:34:14,675
I did miss you.

1062
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:19,259
It wasn't all bad, was it?
Huh?

1063
01:34:19,701 --> 01:34:23,063
Some of it was... good.

1064
01:34:23,264 --> 01:34:24,564
Pretty good.

1065
01:34:27,765 --> 01:34:30,185
Some things never change.

1066
01:34:30,294 --> 01:34:33,354
True.
You still drive me crazy.

1067
01:34:42,535 --> 01:34:44,347
If you see our son...

1068
01:34:46,646 --> 01:34:48,484
...bring him home.

1069
01:34:53,879 --> 01:34:58,027
<i>Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718.
We're searching the area.</i>

1070
01:34:58,594 --> 01:35:00,373
<i>She's just beginning
to test her powers.</i>

1071
01:35:00,385 --> 01:35:04,544
<i>The longer it takes to find her,
the more dangerous she becomes.</i>

1072
01:35:19,216 --> 01:35:20,510
How are we getting in?

1073
01:35:20,524 --> 01:35:22,706
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate.

1074
01:35:22,707 --> 01:35:25,894
Keeps anything travelling slower
than lightspeed from getting through.

1075
01:35:26,083 --> 01:35:28,563
We're making our landing
approach at lightspeed?

1076
01:35:29,238 --> 01:35:30,934
All right, Chewie, get ready.

1077
01:35:32,063 --> 01:35:33,821
And... now!

1078
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,240
I am pulling up!

1079
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:48,593
I get any higher, they'll see us!

1080
01:36:10,268 --> 01:36:14,381
Sir, she was not found in hangar 718.
But all troops are on alert.

1081
01:36:14,382 --> 01:36:18,216
<i>Put every hangar on lock-down.
She's going to try to steal a ship to esc...</i>

1082
01:36:19,842 --> 01:36:21,372
<i>Han Solo...</i>

1083
01:36:32,648 --> 01:36:34,644
The flooding tunnels
are over that ridge.

1084
01:36:34,653 --> 01:36:35,925
We'll get in that way.

1085
01:36:36,098 --> 01:36:37,743
What was your job
when you were based here?

1086
01:36:37,756 --> 01:36:39,039
Sanitation.

1087
01:36:41,562 --> 01:36:42,962
Sanitation?

1088
01:36:43,261 --> 01:36:45,606
Then how do you know how
to disable the shields?

1089
01:36:45,607 --> 01:36:46,582
I don't.

1090
01:36:46,596 --> 01:36:48,080
I'm just here to get Rey.

1091
01:36:48,081 --> 01:36:52,208
People are counting on us!
The galaxy is counting on us!

1092
01:36:52,209 --> 01:36:53,906
Solo, we'll figure it out!

1093
01:36:54,328 --> 01:36:55,749
We'll use the Force!

1094
01:36:55,895 --> 01:36:58,317
That's not how the Force works!

1095
01:36:59,483 --> 01:37:01,329
Oh really, you're cold?

1096
01:37:01,539 --> 01:37:02,639
Come on!

1097
01:37:10,850 --> 01:37:11,650
Report.

1098
01:37:12,129 --> 01:37:14,461
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1099
01:37:16,632 --> 01:37:17,532
<i>Hey!</i>

1100
01:37:20,904 --> 01:37:23,210
The longer we're here,
the less luck we're gonna have.

1101
01:37:23,383 --> 01:37:24,049
The shields.

1102
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:25,747
I have an idea about that.

1103
01:37:33,405 --> 01:37:36,278
- You remember me?
- <i>FN-2187</i>.

1104
01:37:36,279 --> 01:37:38,970
Not anymore.
The name's Finn, and I'm in charge.

1105
01:37:38,971 --> 01:37:41,245
I'm in charge now, Phasma.
I'm in charge.

1106
01:37:41,246 --> 01:37:42,549
Bring it down, bring it down.

1107
01:37:43,225 --> 01:37:44,403
Follow me.

1108
01:37:57,408 --> 01:37:58,948
<i>You checked out the new T-17s?</i>

1109
01:37:59,149 --> 01:38:02,118
<i>T-17s, as far as I can tell,
are a great improvement.</i>

1110
01:38:02,219 --> 01:38:05,501
<i>Yeah. That's what they tell you.
But believe me, they don't look like it.</i>

1111
01:38:05,502 --> 01:38:06,482
<i>They don't?</i>

1112
01:38:42,171 --> 01:38:45,206
You want me to blast that bucket
off your head? Lower the shields.

1113
01:38:45,215 --> 01:38:47,505
<i>You're making a big mistake.</i>

1114
01:38:47,575 --> 01:38:48,475
Do it.

1115
01:38:53,583 --> 01:38:56,913
Solo, if this works, we're not gonna
have a lot of time to find Rey.

1116
01:38:57,273 --> 01:38:58,494
Don't worry, kid.

1117
01:38:59,530 --> 01:39:01,352
We won't leave here without her.

1118
01:39:02,722 --> 01:39:05,417
<i>You can't be so stupid as
to think this will be easy.</i>

1119
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:08,430
<i>My troops will storm this
block and kill you all.</i>

1120
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:10,667
I disagree.
What do we do with her?

1121
01:39:10,668 --> 01:39:12,235
Is there a garbage chute?

1122
01:39:13,026 --> 01:39:14,567
Trash compactor?

1123
01:39:15,299 --> 01:39:16,399
Yeah, there is.

1124
01:39:16,521 --> 01:39:18,211
General, their shields are down.

1125
01:39:18,385 --> 01:39:19,853
Thank the Maker!

1126
01:39:19,854 --> 01:39:21,947
Han did it! Send them in.

1127
01:39:22,056 --> 01:39:23,955
Give Poe full
authorization for attack.

1128
01:39:23,964 --> 01:39:26,242
Black Leader, go to sub-lights.
On your call.

1129
01:39:26,392 --> 01:39:29,113
Roger, base.
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

1130
01:39:29,846 --> 01:39:31,266
Dropping out of lightspeed.

1131
01:39:45,227 --> 01:39:46,591
<i>Almost in range!</i>

1132
01:39:46,592 --> 01:39:49,661
Hit the target dead center.
As many runs as we can get!

1133
01:39:49,673 --> 01:39:50,829
Approaching target.

1134
01:39:55,405 --> 01:39:56,515
<i>Fighters incoming!</i>

1135
01:39:57,195 --> 01:39:59,286
<i>Incoming at 28.336</i>

1136
01:39:59,972 --> 01:40:01,585
Shields up! Shields up!

1137
01:40:01,596 --> 01:40:03,233
Dispatch all squadrons!

1138
01:40:03,242 --> 01:40:04,342
Yes, General.

1139
01:40:05,211 --> 01:40:06,611
All right. Lets light it up!

1140
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:18,470
- Direct hit!
- But no damage.

1141
01:40:18,471 --> 01:40:20,000
<i>Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it!</i>

1142
01:40:20,001 --> 01:40:21,008
Another bombing run!

1143
01:40:21,009 --> 01:40:24,014
<i>Remember, when the sun is gone,
that weapon will be ready to fire.</i>

1144
01:40:24,015 --> 01:40:26,320
But as long as there's light,
we got a chance.

1145
01:40:28,217 --> 01:40:29,992
Guys, we got a lot of company!

1146
01:40:36,327 --> 01:40:38,067
<i>We think they
may be splitting up.</i>

1147
01:40:38,074 --> 01:40:40,166
<i>Head to quadrants 4 and 5.</i>

1148
01:40:47,974 --> 01:40:50,036
We'll use the charges
to blow that blast door.

1149
01:40:50,037 --> 01:40:52,771
I'll go in and draw fire,
but I'm gonna need cover.

1150
01:40:52,772 --> 01:40:54,176
You sure you're up for this?

1151
01:40:54,177 --> 01:40:55,085
Hell no.

1152
01:40:55,086 --> 01:40:58,001
I'll go in and try to find Rey.
The troopers will be on our tail.

1153
01:40:58,002 --> 01:40:59,883
We have to be
ready for that.

1154
01:41:00,284 --> 01:41:01,971
There's an access
tunnel that leads...

1155
01:41:02,221 --> 01:41:04,953
Why are you doing that?
Why are you doing this?

1156
01:41:04,967 --> 01:41:06,247
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1157
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:23,840
You all right?

1158
01:41:24,398 --> 01:41:25,053
Yeah.

1159
01:41:25,154 --> 01:41:25,930
Good.

1160
01:41:26,031 --> 01:41:27,685
What happened to you,
did he hurt you?

1161
01:41:27,786 --> 01:41:29,086
Finn, what are you doing here?

1162
01:41:29,087 --> 01:41:30,400
We came back for you.

1163
01:41:32,090 --> 01:41:33,090
What'd he say?

1164
01:41:33,859 --> 01:41:35,076
That it was your idea.

1165
01:41:39,265 --> 01:41:40,213
Thank you.

1166
01:41:43,957 --> 01:41:45,287
How did you get away?

1167
01:41:45,718 --> 01:41:48,561
I can't explain it.
And you wouldn't believe it.

1168
01:41:48,861 --> 01:41:50,946
Escape now. Hug later.

1169
01:42:06,471 --> 01:42:07,763
I got one behind me.

1170
01:42:08,141 --> 01:42:09,401
<i>- You see it?</i>
- Yeah, I'm on it.

1171
01:42:17,805 --> 01:42:20,496
- Furillo's been hit!
- Watch out for ground fire!

1172
01:42:24,964 --> 01:42:28,035
They're in trouble.
We can't leave.

1173
01:42:29,954 --> 01:42:32,631
My friend's got a bag
full of explosives.

1174
01:42:33,608 --> 01:42:34,793
Let's use 'em.

1175
01:42:34,794 --> 01:42:36,517
General, are you seeing this?

1176
01:42:36,518 --> 01:42:39,969
Two more X-wings down.
That's half our fleet destroyed.

1177
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:43,110
And their weapon will be
fully charged in 10 minutes.

1178
01:42:43,111 --> 01:42:45,440
It would take a
miracle to save us now.

1179
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:13,821
That girl knows her stuff.

1180
01:43:23,855 --> 01:43:26,248
We'll set the charges
against every other column.

1181
01:43:27,859 --> 01:43:29,611
You're right.
That's a better idea.

1182
01:43:29,619 --> 01:43:31,863
You take the top.
I'll go down below.

1183
01:43:31,864 --> 01:43:33,057
Detonator.

1184
01:43:33,702 --> 01:43:34,861
We'll meet back here.

1185
01:44:20,789 --> 01:44:22,161
<i>Find them.</i>

1186
01:45:23,330 --> 01:45:24,530
Ben!

1187
01:45:36,919 --> 01:45:38,129
<i>Han Solo.</i>

1188
01:45:38,935 --> 01:45:41,520
<i>I've been waiting for
this day for a long time.</i>

1189
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:04,306
Take off that mask.
You don't need it.

1190
01:46:04,927 --> 01:46:06,825
<i>What do you think you'll see if I do?</i>

1191
01:46:07,132 --> 01:46:09,354
The face of my son.

1192
01:46:30,792 --> 01:46:33,199
Your son is gone.

1193
01:46:34,746 --> 01:46:37,123
He was weak and foolish, like his father.

1194
01:46:37,358 --> 01:46:38,804
So I destroyed him.

1195
01:46:40,845 --> 01:46:43,233
That's what Snoke
wants you to believe.

1196
01:46:44,452 --> 01:46:46,107
But it's not true.

1197
01:46:47,442 --> 01:46:49,502
My son is alive.

1198
01:46:49,903 --> 01:46:50,848
No.

1199
01:46:51,259 --> 01:46:53,329
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1200
01:46:53,378 --> 01:46:55,676
Snoke is using you for your power.

1201
01:46:56,587 --> 01:46:58,914
When he gets what he wants,
he'll crush you.

1202
01:47:03,423 --> 01:47:05,126
You know it's true.

1203
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:13,760
- It's too late.
- No it's not.

1204
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:15,624
Leave here with me.
Come home.

1205
01:47:16,990 --> 01:47:18,383
We miss you.

1206
01:47:27,031 --> 01:47:28,924
I'm being torn apart.

1207
01:47:31,986 --> 01:47:33,952
I wanna be free of this pain.

1208
01:47:39,824 --> 01:47:43,200
I know what I have to do,
but I don't know if I have the strength to do it.

1209
01:47:46,872 --> 01:47:50,524
- Will you help me?
- Yes. Anything.

1210
01:48:40,265 --> 01:48:41,265
No!

1211
01:48:47,955 --> 01:48:49,107
Thank you.

1212
01:50:12,979 --> 01:50:16,061
The oscillator's been damaged,
but is still functional.

1213
01:50:16,062 --> 01:50:19,255
Admiral, their weapon
will fire in two minutes.

1214
01:50:29,894 --> 01:50:31,028
The <i>Falcon's</i> this way.

1215
01:50:52,633 --> 01:50:53,769
We're not done yet.

1216
01:50:57,125 --> 01:50:58,558
You're a monster!

1217
01:50:58,895 --> 01:51:00,677
It's just us now.

1218
01:51:01,969 --> 01:51:03,955
Han Solo can't save you.

1219
01:51:13,319 --> 01:51:14,319
Rey!

1220
01:51:17,082 --> 01:51:19,214
Rey... Rey...

1221
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:23,830
No, no, no...
Rey...

1222
01:51:26,296 --> 01:51:28,002
Traitor!

1223
01:51:37,902 --> 01:51:39,981
That lightsaber...

1224
01:51:40,822 --> 01:51:43,877
- It belongs to me!
- Come get it.

1225
01:53:31,371 --> 01:53:32,691
We just lost R-1!

1226
01:53:33,029 --> 01:53:34,110
<i>We're overwhelmed!</i>

1227
01:53:34,191 --> 01:53:36,021
What do we do?
It isn't working!

1228
01:53:36,506 --> 01:53:39,426
Black Leader, there's a brand
new hole in that oscillator.

1229
01:53:39,537 --> 01:53:41,137
<i>Looks like our friends got in!</i>

1230
01:53:41,852 --> 01:53:44,351
Red-4! Red-6! Cover us!

1231
01:53:44,352 --> 01:53:45,736
- I'm on it!
- Roger!

1232
01:53:45,737 --> 01:53:48,643
Everybody else, hit the target hard!
Give it everything you got!

1233
01:54:00,953 --> 01:54:02,719
I need some help here!
I need some help!

1234
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:04,063
- I'm coming in!
- Watch out!

1235
01:54:04,944 --> 01:54:06,044
I'm hit!

1236
01:54:11,643 --> 01:54:12,206
All teams...

1237
01:54:12,314 --> 01:54:14,883
<i>I'm going in!
Pull up and cover me!</i>

1238
01:54:14,884 --> 01:54:17,193
Copy that, Black Leader!
Good luck, Poe!

1239
01:54:22,975 --> 01:54:25,339
Weapon fully charged in 30 seconds.

1240
01:54:26,197 --> 01:54:27,601
Prepare to fire!

1241
01:56:00,528 --> 01:56:01,923
You need a teacher!

1242
01:56:03,491 --> 01:56:06,239
I can show you
the ways of the Force!

1243
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:09,440
The Force?

1244
01:58:03,411 --> 01:58:05,505
Lieutenant, get back to your station!

1245
01:58:05,506 --> 01:58:08,586
Just look! We won't survive.
Even Hux is gone!

1246
01:58:08,587 --> 01:58:09,926
Supreme Leader.

1247
01:58:10,984 --> 01:58:12,700
The fuel cells have ruptured.

1248
01:58:13,171 --> 01:58:15,347
The collapse of the planet has begun.

1249
01:58:15,348 --> 01:58:19,550
Leave the base at once
and come to me with Kylo Ren.

1250
01:58:20,743 --> 01:58:25,064
It is time... to complete his training.

1251
01:58:27,581 --> 01:58:28,481
Finn...

1252
01:58:28,868 --> 01:58:29,918
Finn...

1253
01:59:19,355 --> 01:59:20,473
All teams...

1254
01:59:20,474 --> 01:59:22,682
- <i>I got eyes on 'em!</i>
- Yes!

1255
01:59:45,376 --> 01:59:48,377
Our job's done here.
Let's go home!

1256
01:59:59,708 --> 02:00:01,648
Easy, easy. He's hurt.

1257
02:00:02,003 --> 02:00:03,203
We got a heartbeat.

1258
02:01:05,893 --> 02:01:09,253
R2-D2!
You've come back!

1259
02:01:12,546 --> 02:01:16,379
You found what?
How dare you call me that!

1260
02:01:18,846 --> 02:01:20,507
Find Master Luke how?

1261
02:01:21,002 --> 02:01:24,259
Come, R2! We must go
tell the others at once!

1262
02:01:25,329 --> 02:01:28,377
General? 
Excuse me, General?

1263
02:01:33,223 --> 02:01:36,279
R2-D2 may contain some
much needed good news.

1264
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:37,506
Tell me.

1265
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,589
Yeah, all right buddy, hold on.

1266
02:02:04,028 --> 02:02:06,358
Oh, the map! It is complete!

1267
02:02:06,359 --> 02:02:07,662
Luke!

1268
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:11,299
Oh my dear friend.
How I've missed you.

1269
02:02:28,131 --> 02:02:32,085
We'll see each other again.
I believe that.

1270
02:02:40,445 --> 02:02:42,292
Thank you, my friend.

1271
02:02:57,077 --> 02:02:58,562
Rey...

1272
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:02,800
May the Force be with you.
