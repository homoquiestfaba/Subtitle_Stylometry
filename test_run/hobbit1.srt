1
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:09,569
<i>My dear Frodo:

2
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:14,578
<i>You asked me once...

3
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,458
<i>...if I had told you everything
there was to know about my adventures.

4
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:20,751
<i>And while I can honestly...

5
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:22,044
<i>...say I have told you...

6
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:24,421
<i>...the truth...

7
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:29,422
<i>...I may not have told you all of it.

8
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:38,268
<i>I am old now, Frodo.

9
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:43,269
<i>I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.

10
00:01:44,317 --> 00:01:46,026
<i>I think...

11
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:49,029
<i>...it is time for you to know...

12
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,200
<i>...what really happened.

13
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:54,952
<i>It began...

14
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:57,746
<i>...long ago...

15
00:01:57,747 --> 00:02:01,125
<i>...in a land far away to the east...

16
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:06,126
<i>...the like of which you will not find
in the world today.

17
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,809
<i>There was the city of Dale.

18
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,144
<i>Its markets known...

19
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:21,437
<i>...far and wide.

20
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:25,607
<i>Full of the bounties of vine and vale.

21
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:30,608
<i>Peaceful and prosperous.

22
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,282
<i>For this city lay before the doors...

23
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:37,202
<i>...of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth:

24
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:39,580
<i>Erebor.

25
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:41,874
<i>Stronghold of Thror...

26
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,877
<i>...King Under the Mountain. Mightiest...

27
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,838
<i>...of the Dwarf Lords.

28
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:50,757
<i>Thror ruled with utter surety...

29
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:53,385
<i>...never doubting his house would endure...

30
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:54,845
<i>...for his line lay secure...

31
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:57,598
<i>...in the lives of his son...

32
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,601
<i>...and grandson.

33
00:03:00,602 --> 00:03:04,062
<i>Ah, Frodo. Erebor.

34
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:06,523
<i>Built deep within the mountain itself...

35
00:03:06,524 --> 00:03:10,360
<i>...the beauty of this fortress city was legend.

36
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:13,113
<i>Its wealth lay in the earth...

37
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:15,032
<i>...in precious gems hewn...

38
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:18,368
<i>...from rock and in great seams of gold...

39
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:23,369
<i>...running like rivers through stone.

40
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,918
<i>The skill of the Dwarves...

41
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,921
<i>...was unequaled, fashioning objects...

42
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:31,757
<i>...of great beauty...

43
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:36,053
<i>...out of diamond, emerald,
ruby and sapphire.

44
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:37,846
<i>Ever they delved deeper...

45
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:40,599
<i>...down into the dark.

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>And that is where they found it.

47
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:53,445
<i>The Heart of the Mountain.

48
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:56,240
<i>The Arkenstone.

49
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:59,284
<i>Thror named it "The King's Jewel".

50
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:02,454
<i>He took it as a sign,
a sign that his right to rule...

51
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:04,331
<i>...was divine.

52
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:05,749
<i>All would pay...

53
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,042
<i>...homage to him.

54
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:08,293
Even the great...

55
00:04:08,294 --> 00:04:13,294
<i>...Elven King, Thranduil.

56
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:20,639
<i>As the great wealth of the Dwarves grew...

57
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,640
<i>...their store of good will ran thin.

58
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:30,937
<i>No one knows exactly what began the rift.

59
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:32,651
<i>The Elves say...

60
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:35,237
<i>...the Dwarves stole their treasure.

61
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:36,989
<i>The Dwarves tell another tale.

62
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,660
<i>They say the Elf King
refused to give them their rightful pay.

63
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:44,121
<i>It is sad, Frodo, how old alliances...

64
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:45,455
<i>...can be broken.

65
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:48,875
<i>How friendships between peoples
can be lost.

66
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:51,712
And for what?

67
00:04:59,762 --> 00:05:03,557
<i>Slowly the days turned sour...

68
00:05:03,558 --> 00:05:08,558
<i>...and the watchful nights closed in.

69
00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:17,696
<i>Thror's love of gold...

70
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:21,283
<i>...had grown too fierce.

71
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:26,079
<i>A sickness had begun to grow within him.

72
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,080
<i>It was a sickness of the mind.

73
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:35,005
<i>And where sickness thrives...

74
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:40,006
<i>...bad things will follow.

75
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:48,894
<i>The first they heard
was a noise...

76
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,771
<i>...like a hurricane coming down...

77
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:51,980
<i>...from the North.

78
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:54,775
<i>The pines on the mountain
creaked and cracked...

79
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:57,361
<i>...in the hot, dry wind.

80
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:04,743
Balin, sound the alarm.

81
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,664
Call out the guard. Do it now!

82
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:10,123
What is it?

83
00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:12,292
Dragon.

84
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:16,630
Dragon!

85
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:17,589
<i>He was...

86
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,590
<i>...a firedrake from the North.

87
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:28,767
<i>Smaug...

88
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:33,768
<i>...had come.

89
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,594
<i>Such wanton death...

90
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:08,056
<i>...was dealt that day.

91
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:09,766
<i>For this city of Men was nothing...

92
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,768
<i>...to Smaug.

93
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:12,811
<i>His eye...

94
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:17,812
<i>...was set on another prize.

95
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:21,570
<i>For dragons...

96
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:23,488
<i>...covet gold...

97
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:24,573
<i>...with a dark and...

98
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:29,574
<i>...fierce desire.

99
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:37,999
<font color=#FF8000>Therk√¢!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(Steady!)</font>

100
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:58,940
Aah!

101
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:03,941
No!

102
00:08:05,948 --> 00:08:08,533
Come on.

103
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:13,534
<i>Erebor was lost.

104
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:16,833
<i>For a dragon...

105
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:19,419
<i>...will guard his plunder...

106
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,420
<i>...as long as he lives.

107
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:32,307
Run for your lives!

108
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:37,308
Ah! Help us!

109
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:50,992
<i>Thranduil would not risk
the lives of his kin against...

110
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:53,161
<i>...the wrath of the dragon.

111
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:55,038
<i>No help came from the Elves...

112
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,039
<i>...that day, nor any day since.

113
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,380
<i>Robbed of their homeland...

114
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:06,925
<i>...the Dwarves of Erebor
wandered the wilderness...

115
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:11,926
<i>...a once mighty people brought low.

116
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:16,184
<i>The young Dwarf prince took work
where he could find it...

117
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:18,687
<i>...laboring in the villages of Men.

118
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:21,398
<i>But always he remembered...

119
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,025
<i>...the mountain smoke beneath the moon...

120
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:27,445
<i>...the trees like torches blazing bright.

121
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:29,197
<i>For he had seen dragon fire...

122
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:30,949
...in the sky...

123
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,829
<i>...and a city turned to ash.

124
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,831
<i>And he never forgave...

125
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:40,417
<i>...and he never forgot.

126
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:45,589
<i>Far away, in another corner of the world...

127
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,506
<i>...dragons were...

128
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:47,507
...only make-believe.

129
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:48,550
Up they go!

130
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:49,551
<i>A party trick...

131
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:50,802
<i>...conjured by Wizards...

132
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:52,470
<i>...on Midsummer's Eve.

133
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:53,388
<i>No more frightening...

134
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:54,681
<i>...than fairy dust.

135
00:09:57,143 --> 00:09:58,184
Bilbo!

136
00:09:58,185 --> 00:10:00,645
<i>And that, my dear Frodo...

137
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:01,605
<i>...is where I come in.

138
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:05,108
Bilbo! Bilbo.

139
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:08,987
<i>It was the beginning
of an unlikely friendship...

140
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:11,865
<i>...that has lasted all my life.

141
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:19,581
<i>But it is not the start of my story.
For me, it began...

142
00:10:19,582 --> 00:10:23,543
<i>Well, it began as you might expect.

143
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:26,922
<i>In a hole in the ground, there lived...

144
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:30,175
<i>...a Hobbit.

145
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:35,176
<i>Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells.

146
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:38,266
<i>This was a Hobbit hole.

147
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:43,267
<i>And that means good food, a warm hearth...

148
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:48,981
<i>...and all the comforts of home.

149
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:23,895
Thank you.

150
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,522
What's this?

151
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:26,898
That is private.

152
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:29,901
Keep your sticky paws off.

153
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:32,195
It's not ready yet.

154
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:33,905
Not ready for what?

155
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:38,906
Reading.

156
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:41,621
What on earth are these?

157
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:43,665
Replies to the party invitations.

158
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:48,211
Ah. Good gracious. Is it today?

159
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:49,796
They all say they're coming.

160
00:11:49,797 --> 00:11:53,800
Except for the Sackville-Bagginses,
who are demanding you ask them in person.

161
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:56,469
Are they, indeed? Over my...

162
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,513
- ...dead body.
- They'd probably find that...

163
00:11:58,514 --> 00:11:59,597
...quite agreeable.

164
00:11:59,598 --> 00:12:01,975
They seem to think you have tunnels
overflowing with gold.

165
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:06,354
It was one small chest, hardly overflowing.

166
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:09,065
And it still smells of Troll.

167
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:10,650
What on earth are you doing?

168
00:12:13,654 --> 00:12:16,573
Taking precautions. You know...

169
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:19,200
...I caught her making off
with the silverware once.

170
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:23,163
- Who?
- Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

171
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:26,791
She had all my spoons
stuffed in her pocket. Ha!

172
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,168
Dreadful woman.

173
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:32,547
Make sure you keep an eye on her
after I'm...

174
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:35,300
When I'm... When I'm...

175
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:40,301
When you're what?

176
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:46,223
It's nothing. Nothing.

177
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,525
You know, some people are beginning
to wonder about you, Uncle.

178
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:55,403
- Huh?
- They think you're becoming odd.

179
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:58,073
Odd? Oh. Hm.

180
00:12:58,074 --> 00:12:59,574
Unsociable.

181
00:12:59,575 --> 00:13:02,660
Unsociable, me? Nonsense.

182
00:13:02,661 --> 00:13:04,120
Be a good lad and put that...

183
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:09,121
...on the gate.

184
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:16,424
Do you think he'll come?

185
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:17,759
Who?

186
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,010
Gandalf.

187
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:23,223
Oh-ho. He wouldn't miss a chance
to let off his Whizpoppers. He'll give us...

188
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:24,891
...quite a show, you'll see.

189
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:27,227
- Right, then. I'm off.
- Off to where?

190
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:29,562
East-farthing Woods.
I'm going to surprise him.

191
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:34,563
Well, go on, then. You don't want to be late.

192
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:42,117
<i>He doesn't approve of being late.
Not that I...

193
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:43,743
<i>...ever was.

194
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:47,372
<i>In those days, I was always on time.

195
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:51,459
<i>I was entirely respectable.

196
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,672
<i>And nothing unexpected...

197
00:13:55,673 --> 00:14:00,673
<i>...ever happened.

198
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,359


199
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:24,367
- Good morning.
- What do you mean?

200
00:14:24,368 --> 00:14:28,288
Do you wish me a good morning
or do you mean that it is a good morning...

201
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:30,665
...whether I want it or not'?

202
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:35,420
Or perhaps you mean to say that you feel good
on this particular morning?

203
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:40,421
Or are you simply stating
that this is a morning to be good on? Hm?

204
00:14:40,718 --> 00:14:44,012
All of them at once, I suppose.

205
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:49,013
Hmm.

206
00:14:49,518 --> 00:14:50,852
Can I help you?

207
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:54,772
That remains to be seen.

208
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:59,773
I'm looking for someone
to share in an adventure.

209
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:05,533
An adventure?

210
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:10,534
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree
would have much interest in adventures.

211
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:16,252
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things.

212
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:18,838
Make you late for dinner. Heh, heh.

213
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:19,839
Mm.

214
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,925
Huh.

215
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:24,552
<i>Hmm.

216
00:15:24,553 --> 00:15:26,888
Oh. Ah.

217
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:28,223
Good morning.

218
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:31,309
To think that I should have lived
to be "good morninged"...

219
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:36,310
...by Belladonna Took's son
as if I were selling buttons at the door.

220
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:38,608
Beg your pardon?

221
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:40,568
You've changed,
and not entirely for the better...

222
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:41,945
...Bilbo Baggins.

223
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:43,363
I'm sorry, do I know you?

224
00:15:43,364 --> 00:15:46,699
Well, you know my name,
although you don't remember I belong to it.

225
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,368
I'm Gandalf.

226
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:52,538
And Gandalf means...

227
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:54,290
...me.

228
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,542
Gandalf?
Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard...

229
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:58,044
...who made such excellent...

230
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:03,007
...fireworks? Old Took used to have them
on Midsummer's Eve. Heh, heh. Ahem.

231
00:16:03,008 --> 00:16:05,885
No idea you were still in business.

232
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:07,595
And where else should I be?

233
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:12,267
Where else...? Ahem.

234
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:16,312
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember
something about me...

235
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:19,857
...even if it's only my fireworks.

236
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:22,527
Yes. Well, that's decided.

237
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:25,905
It'll be very good for you...

238
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:27,740
...and most amusing for me.

239
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:29,575
I shall inform the others.

240
00:16:29,576 --> 00:16:33,037
Inform the who? What? No. No. No... Wait.

241
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:34,414
We do not want...

242
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:38,793
...any adventures here,
thank you. Not today. Not...

243
00:16:38,794 --> 00:16:43,794
I suggest you try Over the Hill
or Across the Water.

244
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:50,634
Good morning.

245
00:17:36,143 --> 00:17:41,143
Morning!

246
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:53,659
Twelve. There we go. Have a very good day.

247
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:18,101
Chum.

248
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:20,812
Hello, Mr. Bilbo. Here.

249
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:24,607
Have a feel of me tubers.
Nice and firm, they are.

250
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:27,402
- Just come in from West Farthing.
- Very impressive, Mr. Worrywort.

251
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:31,364
Now, I don't suppose you've seen
a Wizard lurking around these parts?

252
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:32,907
A tall fellow.

253
00:18:32,908 --> 00:18:34,158
Long, gray beard.

254
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:36,577
Pointy hat.

255
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:41,578
Can't say I have.

256
00:19:26,253 --> 00:19:29,881
Dwalin, at your service.

257
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:32,800
Hm. Uh...

258
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:37,013
Bilbo Baggins, at yours.

259
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:38,139
Do we...

260
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,891
...know each other?

261
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:42,059
No.

262
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,853
Which way, laddie?

263
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:45,354
Is it down here?

264
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:46,439
Is what...

265
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,899
...down where?

266
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,609
<i>Supper.

267
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,487
He said there'd be food and lots of it.

268
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:57,488
He... He said? Who said?

269
00:19:57,826 --> 00:20:02,826
Mmm.

270
00:20:03,707 --> 00:20:06,292
Mmm.

271
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:09,754
Very good, this. Any more?

272
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:12,173
What? Oh, yes, yes.

273
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:17,174
Ah.

274
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:23,643
Help yourself.

275
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:28,644
Hmm. It's just that, um,
I wasn't expecting company.

276
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:37,361
That'll be the door.

277
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:39,492
Balin...

278
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:42,370
...at your service.

279
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:43,412
Good evening.

280
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:45,831
Yes. Yes, it is.

281
00:20:45,832 --> 00:20:48,501
- Though I think it might rain later.
- Hm?

282
00:20:48,502 --> 00:20:50,294
Am I late?

283
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:52,630
Late for what?

284
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:53,589
Oh!

285
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,466
Ha, ha!

286
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:57,385
Evening, brother.

287
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:00,846
By my beard...

288
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:04,016
...you're shorter and wider than last we met.

289
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:06,227
Wider, not shorter.

290
00:21:06,228 --> 00:21:09,313
Sharp enough for both of us.

291
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:20,783
Uh, excuse me? Sorry, I hate to interrupt.

292
00:21:20,784 --> 00:21:25,079
But the thing is, I'm not entirely sure
you're in the right house.

293
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,290
- Have you eaten?
- It's not that I don't like...

294
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,125
...visitors. I like visitors...

295
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:31,419
...as much as the next Hobbit.

296
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,172
But I do like to know them
before they come visiting.

297
00:21:35,173 --> 00:21:36,674
- What is this?
- I don't know.

298
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:39,802
- I think it's cheese. Gone blue.
- It's riddled with mold.

299
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:44,803
The thing is, I don't know either of you.
Not in the slightest. I don't mean...

300
00:21:45,392 --> 00:21:47,643
...to be blunt, but I had to speak my mind.

301
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:50,104
- I'm sorry.
- You think...?

302
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:54,025
Apology accepted.

303
00:21:54,026 --> 00:21:55,693
- Ah.
- Now, fill it up, brother...

304
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:56,611
...don't stint.

305
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:01,574
- You wanna get stuck in?
- I could eat again if you insist, brother.

306
00:22:02,993 --> 00:22:05,036
- Fili.
- And Kili.

307
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:07,038
At your service.

308
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,623
You must be Mr. Boggins.

309
00:22:08,624 --> 00:22:10,958
Nope! You can't come in.
You've come to the wrong house.

310
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,084
What?

311
00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:14,879
- Has it been canceled?
- No one told us.

312
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,464
No, nothing's been canceled.

313
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:21,465
That's a relief.

314
00:22:21,595 --> 00:22:23,137
Careful with these.

315
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:25,556
I just had them sharpened.

316
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:27,475
- It's nice, this place.
- Yeah.

317
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:30,936
- Did you do it yourself?
- What? No, it's been in the family for years.

318
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:33,981
That's my mother's glory box.
Can you please not do that?

319
00:22:33,982 --> 00:22:36,776
Fili, Kili. Come on, give us a hand.

320
00:22:36,777 --> 00:22:39,904
Mr. Dwalin. Ha, ha.

321
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:43,115
Shove this in the hallway.
Otherwise we'll never get everyone in.

322
00:22:43,116 --> 00:22:46,160
- "Everyone"? How many more are there?
- Where do you want this?

323
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:48,245
- Oh, no.
- It's really heavy.

324
00:22:48,246 --> 00:22:51,040
No. No. There's nobody home!

325
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,959
Go away and bother somebody else.

326
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,338
There's far too many Dwarves
in my dining room as it is.

327
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:01,467
If this is some clot-head's idea of a joke...

328
00:23:01,468 --> 00:23:04,136
...I can only say it is in very...

329
00:23:04,137 --> 00:23:05,846
...poor taste.

330
00:23:07,224 --> 00:23:08,182
Get off...

331
00:23:08,183 --> 00:23:09,558
...you big lump!

332
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,565
Gandalf.

333
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:22,822
Excuse me, that's my chicken. Um...

334
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,283
If-- If you don't...
That's my wine. Excuse me!

335
00:23:26,284 --> 00:23:29,620
<font color=#FF8000>Khuzd Belkul!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(A mighty Dwarf!)</font>

336
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:32,665
He's got an injury.

337
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,125
You mean the ax in his head?

338
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:37,169
Dead? No, only between his ears.

339
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:41,674
His legs work fine.

340
00:23:41,675 --> 00:23:43,050
Put those back.

341
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:44,135
Put that back.

342
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:45,428
Put that back.

343
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:46,345
Not the jam.

344
00:23:46,346 --> 00:23:47,513
Excuse me. Excuse me.

345
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:50,599
It's a tad excessive, isn't it?
Have you got a cheese knife?

346
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,644
- "Cheese knife"? He eats it by the block.
- Ugh.

347
00:23:53,645 --> 00:23:57,231
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair...
No, so is that. Take it back, please.

348
00:23:57,232 --> 00:24:01,610
- I cannot hear what you're saying.
- It's an antique. Not for sitting on.

349
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:06,611
That is a book, not a coaster.
And put that map down.

350
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:09,368
- Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf?
- Yes?

351
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:12,204
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?

352
00:24:12,205 --> 00:24:17,205
Oh, no, thank you, Dori.
A little red wine for me, I think.

353
00:24:19,463 --> 00:24:24,383
- Whoop! Mind out.
- Yes. Ah.

354
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:27,428
Uh, Fili, Kili. Uh...

355
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:29,722
Oin, Gloin.

356
00:24:29,723 --> 00:24:32,892
Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur...

357
00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:35,770
- ...Dori, Nori. Ori!
- No. Not my prizewinners, thank you.

358
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:38,022
No, thank you.

359
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,483
<font color=#FF8000>Lu zayara, maima mut karima.</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(Our great leader, he is not here.)</font>

360
00:24:40,484 --> 00:24:43,152
Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.

361
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:45,654
We appear to be one Dwarf short.

362
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:50,655
He is late, is all. He traveled north
to a meeting of our kin. He will come.

363
00:24:51,244 --> 00:24:55,164
Mr. Gandalf? A little glass of red wine,
as requested.

364
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:57,374
It's got a fruity bouquet.

365
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,877
Oh. Cheers.

366
00:24:59,878 --> 00:25:04,381
Bombur's on his second leg of lamb already.

367
00:25:04,382 --> 00:25:05,633
Hmm.

368
00:25:06,843 --> 00:25:09,512
No chance. Not from that distance.

369
00:25:09,513 --> 00:25:11,639
Wanna bet? Bombur...

370
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,140
...catch!

371
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:17,853
I'll help you with that.

372
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:25,611
Oh, you great...

373
00:25:25,612 --> 00:25:26,904
...galumphing git!

374
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:28,197
Who wants an ale? There you go.

375
00:25:28,198 --> 00:25:30,115
Over here, brother.

376
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:31,367
I said have another...

377
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:33,577
...drink. Here you go.

378
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:40,042
Ale on the count of three!

379
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:40,960
One...

380
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:45,961
- ...two...
- Up!

381
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:55,516
I knew you had it in you!

382
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:58,310
Excuse me, that is a doily, not a dishcloth.

383
00:25:58,311 --> 00:25:59,603
But it's full of holes.

384
00:25:59,604 --> 00:26:02,022
It's supposed to look like that. It's crochet.

385
00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:05,192
And a wonderful game it is too,
if you've got the balls for it.

386
00:26:05,193 --> 00:26:07,278
Bebother and confusticate these Dwarves!

387
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,197
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?

388
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:13,200
What's the matter?
I'm surrounded by Dwarves.

389
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:14,952
What are they doing here?

390
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:18,873
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering
once you get used to them.

391
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:21,000
I don't want to get used to them.

392
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:24,336
Look at the state of my kitchen.
There's mud trod into the carpet.

393
00:26:24,337 --> 00:26:25,921
They've pillaged the pantry.

394
00:26:25,922 --> 00:26:28,507
I won't tell you what they've done
in the bathroom.

395
00:26:28,508 --> 00:26:32,553
They've destroyed the plumbing. I don't
understand what they're doing in my house!

396
00:26:32,554 --> 00:26:37,554
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but what should I do with my plate?

397
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:42,934
Here you go, Ori. Give it to me.

398
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,816
Take that back.

399
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:46,942
Excuse me.

400
00:26:46,943 --> 00:26:48,235
That's my mother's...

401
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:49,987
...West Farthing pottery. It's over...

402
00:26:49,988 --> 00:26:54,617
...100 years old!

403
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:55,534
And can you...

404
00:26:55,535 --> 00:26:56,535
...not do that?

405
00:26:56,536 --> 00:26:57,453
You'll blunt them.

406
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:59,997
Ooh. Do you hear that, lads?

407
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:01,040
He says...

408
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,958
...we'll blunt the knives.

409
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:05,044
<i>Blunt the knives, bend the forks

410
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:07,713
<i>Smash the bottles and burn the corks

411
00:27:07,714 --> 00:27:10,674
<i>Chip the glasses and crack the plates

412
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:12,259
<i>That's what Bilbo Baggins

413
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,177
<i>Hates

414
00:27:13,178 --> 00:27:14,803
<i>Cut the cloth, tread on the fat

415
00:27:14,804 --> 00:27:16,847
<i>Leave the bones on the bedroom mat

416
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:20,517
<i>Pour the milk on the pantry floor

417
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:21,852
<i>Splash the wine

418
00:27:21,853 --> 00:27:22,770
<i>On every door

419
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,563
<i>Dump the crooks in a boiling bowl

420
00:27:24,564 --> 00:27:26,357
<i>Pound them up with a thumping pole

421
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:27,274
<i>When you're finished

422
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:31,445
<i>If they are whole

423
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:36,446
<i>Send them down the hall to roll

424
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:43,624
<i>That's what Bilbo Baggins hates

425
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:50,339
Bilbo.

426
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:02,389
He is here.

427
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:06,105
Gandalf.

428
00:28:06,106 --> 00:28:07,147
I thought you said...

429
00:28:07,148 --> 00:28:08,440
...this place would be easy...

430
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:11,193
...to find. I lost my way, twice.

431
00:28:11,194 --> 00:28:14,863
I wouldn't have found it at all
had it not been for that mark on the door.

432
00:28:14,864 --> 00:28:17,992
Mark? There's no mark on that door.
It was painted a week ago.

433
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:21,829
There is a mark. I put it there myself.

434
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,500
Bilbo Baggins, allow me to introduce
the leader of our company...

435
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:28,669
...Thorin Oakenshield.

436
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,714
So...

437
00:28:31,715 --> 00:28:34,466
...this is the Hobbit.

438
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:37,011
Tell me, Mr. Baggins,
have you done much fighting?

439
00:28:37,012 --> 00:28:39,138
- Pardon me?
- Ax or sword?

440
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:40,848
What's your weapon of choice?

441
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:44,518
Well, I do have some skill at conkers,
if you must know...

442
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,480
...but I fail to see why that's relevant.

443
00:28:48,481 --> 00:28:50,274
Thought as much.

444
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:53,277
He looks more like a grocer than a burglar.

445
00:28:58,283 --> 00:28:59,199
What news...

446
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,202
...from the meeting in Ered Luin?
Did they all come?

447
00:29:02,203 --> 00:29:05,456
- Aye. Envoys from all seven kingdoms.
- All of them!

448
00:29:05,457 --> 00:29:09,168
And what did the Dwarves
of the Iron Hills say?

449
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:13,464
Is Dain with us?

450
00:29:13,465 --> 00:29:15,132
They will not come.

451
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:19,261
They say this quest...

452
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:24,262
...is ours and ours alone.

453
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:27,811
You're going on a quest?

454
00:29:27,812 --> 00:29:32,812
Bilbo, my dear fellow,
let us have a little more light.

455
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:36,028
Far to the east...

456
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:39,073
...over ranges and rivers...

457
00:29:39,074 --> 00:29:42,576
...beyond woodlands and wastelands...

458
00:29:42,577 --> 00:29:47,577
...lies a single, solitary peak.

459
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,834
"The Lonely Mountain".

460
00:29:50,835 --> 00:29:53,170
Aye, Oin has read...

461
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:57,841
...the portents,
and the portents say it is time.

462
00:29:57,842 --> 00:29:59,093
Ravens have been seen...

463
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:02,888
...flying back to the mountain,
as it was foretold.

464
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:05,682
"When the birds of yore return...

465
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:07,017
...to Erebor...

466
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:08,769
...the reign of the beast...

467
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:13,565
...will end."

468
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:15,943
- Uh, what beast?
- That would be a reference...

469
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:17,444
...to Smaug the Terrible...

470
00:30:17,445 --> 00:30:18,946
...chiefest and greatest...

471
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:22,116
...calamity of our age.

472
00:30:22,117 --> 00:30:24,034
Airborne fire-breather.

473
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:25,285
Teeth like razors...

474
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:26,995
...claws like meat hooks.

475
00:30:26,996 --> 00:30:28,539
Fond of precious metals.

476
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,998
Yes, I know what a dragon is.

477
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:31,959
I'm not afraid. I'm up for it.

478
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,962
I'll give him a taste of Dwarfish iron
right up his jacksie!

479
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:35,879
Good lad, Ori!

480
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,797
Sit down.

481
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:38,215
The task would be difficult...

482
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:39,842
...with an army behind us...

483
00:30:39,843 --> 00:30:42,177
...but we number just 13.

484
00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:44,680
And not 13 of the best...

485
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:46,306
...nor brightest.

486
00:30:46,307 --> 00:30:48,642
Here, who are you calling dim?

487
00:30:48,643 --> 00:30:50,352
Sorry, what did he say?

488
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:53,021
We may be few in number...

489
00:30:53,022 --> 00:30:56,275
...but we're fighters, all of us...

490
00:30:56,276 --> 00:30:57,526
...to the last Dwarf.

491
00:30:57,527 --> 00:30:59,945
And you forget,
we have a Wizard in our company.

492
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:02,531
Gandalf will have killed
hundreds of dragons.

493
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:04,700
Oh, well, no. I wouldn't say...

494
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:06,869
- How many, then?
- What?

495
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,913
How many dragons have you killed?

496
00:31:11,207 --> 00:31:12,332
Go on.

497
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,084
Give us a number.

498
00:31:16,212 --> 00:31:18,380
Excuse me. Please.

499
00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:22,217
<font color=#FF8000>Atk√¢t!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(Silence!)</font>

500
00:31:22,218 --> 00:31:23,844
If we have read these signs...

501
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:28,807
...do you not think others
will have read them too?

502
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:31,768
Rumors have begun to spread.

503
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:36,106
The dragon, Smaug,
has not been seen for 60 years.

504
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:39,234
Eyes look east to the mountain, assessing...

505
00:31:39,235 --> 00:31:42,946
...wondering, weighing the risk.

506
00:31:42,947 --> 00:31:45,949
Perhaps the vast wealth of our people
now lies unprotected.

507
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:50,120
Do we sit back while others claim
what is rightfully ours?

508
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:52,289
Or do we seize this chance...

509
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,248
...to take back Erebor?

510
00:31:53,249 --> 00:31:55,292
<font color=#FF8000>Du Bek√¢r! Du Bek√¢r!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(To arms! To arms!)</font>

511
00:31:55,293 --> 00:31:58,503
You forget, the Front Gate is sealed.

512
00:31:58,504 --> 00:31:59,630
There is no way...

513
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:01,757
...into the mountain.

514
00:32:01,758 --> 00:32:06,758
That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.

515
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:11,016
How came you by this?

516
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:12,267
It was given to me...

517
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:14,102
...by your father.

518
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:15,854
By Thrain.

519
00:32:15,855 --> 00:32:18,190
For safekeeping.

520
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:19,149
It is yours...

521
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:24,150
...now.

522
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:30,077
If there is a key...

523
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:32,287
...there must be a door.

524
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:33,205
These runes...

525
00:32:33,206 --> 00:32:37,000
...speak of a hidden passage
to the Lower Halls.

526
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:39,336
There's another way in.

527
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:43,340
Well, if we can find it,
but Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

528
00:32:45,468 --> 00:32:48,512
The answer lies hidden somewhere
in this map...

529
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:50,722
...and I do not have the skill to find it.

530
00:32:50,723 --> 00:32:55,723
But there are others in Middle-earth
who can.

531
00:32:55,853 --> 00:32:59,398
The task I have in mind
will require a great deal of stealth...

532
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:03,235
...and no small amount of courage.

533
00:33:03,236 --> 00:33:07,614
But if we are careful and clever,
I believe that it can be done.

534
00:33:07,615 --> 00:33:09,491
That's why we need a burglar.

535
00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:13,161
Hmm. And a good one too.
An expert, I'd imagine.

536
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:17,874
And are you?

537
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,501
Am I what?

538
00:33:19,502 --> 00:33:22,754
He said he's an expert. Hey.

539
00:33:22,755 --> 00:33:27,755
Me? No. No, no, no. I'm not a burglar.
I've never stolen a thing in my life.

540
00:33:27,802 --> 00:33:30,679
Well, I'm afraid I have to agree
with Mr. Baggins.

541
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,889
He's hardly burglar material.

542
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,558
Nope.

543
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,562
Aye, the Wild is no place for gentle folk
who can neither fight nor fend for themselves.

544
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:40,897
He's just fine.

545
00:33:45,987 --> 00:33:47,404
Enough!

546
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:49,197
If I say Bilbo Baggins...

547
00:33:49,198 --> 00:33:50,907
...is a burglar, then a burglar...

548
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:53,910
...he is.

549
00:33:53,911 --> 00:33:55,370
Hobbits are light...

550
00:33:55,371 --> 00:33:59,750
...on their feet. In fact, they can pass
unseen by most, if they choose.

551
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:03,545
And, while the dragon is accustomed
to the smell of Dwarf...

552
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:06,006
...the scent of a Hobbit is all but...

553
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:10,135
...unknown to him,
which gives us a distinct advantage.

554
00:34:10,136 --> 00:34:13,013
You asked me to find
the 14th member of this company...

555
00:34:13,014 --> 00:34:14,806
...and I have chosen Mr. Baggins.

556
00:34:14,807 --> 00:34:16,224
There's more to him...

557
00:34:16,225 --> 00:34:17,934
...than appearances suggest.

558
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:22,356
And he's got a great deal more to offer
than any of you know.

559
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:27,357
Including himself.

560
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:34,447
You must trust me on this.

561
00:34:34,994 --> 00:34:36,661
Very well.

562
00:34:36,662 --> 00:34:38,455
- We will do it your way.
- No, no.

563
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:41,041
- Give him the contract.
- We're in. We're off.

564
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:43,168
It's just the usual. Summary...

565
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:45,253
...of out-of-pocket expenses,
time required...

566
00:34:45,254 --> 00:34:46,254
...remuneration...

567
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:49,007
...funeral arrangements, so forth.

568
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:53,387
Funeral arrangements?

569
00:34:56,182 --> 00:34:58,392
I cannot guarantee his safety.

570
00:34:58,393 --> 00:35:00,102
Understood.

571
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:05,103
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.

572
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:08,068
Agreed.

573
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,985
"Terms: Cash on...

574
00:35:08,986 --> 00:35:12,823
...delivery, up to but not exceeding
one-fourteenth of total profit, if any."

575
00:35:12,824 --> 00:35:14,866
Hmm. Seems fair.

576
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:18,745
"Present company shall not be liable
for injuries inflicted by...

577
00:35:18,746 --> 00:35:23,746
...or sustained as a consequence thereof,
including, but not limited to lacerations...

578
00:35:25,378 --> 00:35:29,673
...evisceration..."

579
00:35:29,674 --> 00:35:31,883
- Incineration?
- Aye.

580
00:35:31,884 --> 00:35:36,884
He'll melt the flesh off your bones
in the blink of an eye.

581
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,475
You all right, laddie?

582
00:35:40,476 --> 00:35:43,770
Huh? Yeah.

583
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:45,522
Feel a bit faint.

584
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:47,691
- Think furnace with wings.
- Air.

585
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:49,317
I need air.

586
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:51,486
Flash of light, searing pain, then...

587
00:35:51,487 --> 00:35:54,239
...poof. You're nothing more than a pile of ash.

588
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,240
Hmm.

589
00:36:00,413 --> 00:36:02,664
Nope.

590
00:36:02,665 --> 00:36:04,875
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.

591
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:08,170
I'll be all right.
Just let me sit quietly for a moment.

592
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:11,256
You've been sitting quietly for far too long.

593
00:36:11,257 --> 00:36:13,091
Tell me...

594
00:36:13,092 --> 00:36:15,594
...when did doilies
and your mother's dishes...

595
00:36:15,595 --> 00:36:17,804
...become so important to you?

596
00:36:17,805 --> 00:36:22,805
I remember a young Hobbit who was always
running off in search of Elves in the woods.

597
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,146
Who would stay out late,
come home after dark...

598
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:29,941
...trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.

599
00:36:29,942 --> 00:36:32,611
A young Hobbit who would have liked
nothing better...

600
00:36:32,612 --> 00:36:36,531
...than to find out what was beyond
the borders of the Shire.

601
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:37,449
The world...

602
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:41,369
...is not in your books and maps.

603
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,287
It's out...

604
00:36:42,288 --> 00:36:45,248
...there.

605
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:47,709
I can't just go running off into the blue.

606
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,046
I am a Baggins of Bag-end.

607
00:36:51,047 --> 00:36:54,883
You are also a Took.

608
00:36:54,884 --> 00:36:55,842
Did you know...

609
00:36:55,843 --> 00:36:57,552
...that your great-great-great-great-uncle...

610
00:36:57,553 --> 00:36:59,930
...Bullroarer Took was so large...

611
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:01,473
...he could ride a real horse?

612
00:37:01,474 --> 00:37:02,641
- Yes.
- Yes...

613
00:37:02,642 --> 00:37:03,808
...well, he could.

614
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:06,853
In the Battle of Green Fields,
he charged the Goblin ranks.

615
00:37:06,854 --> 00:37:10,857
He swung his club so hard,
it knocked the Goblin king's head clean off...

616
00:37:10,858 --> 00:37:15,237
...and it sailed 100 yards through the air
and went down a rabbit hole.

617
00:37:15,238 --> 00:37:17,697
And thus, the battle was won.

618
00:37:17,698 --> 00:37:22,698
And the game of golf invented
at the same time.

619
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:26,289
I do believe you made that up.

620
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:31,290
Well, all good stories
deserve embellishment.

621
00:37:31,504 --> 00:37:36,504
You'll have a tale or two to tell of your own
when you come back.

622
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,390
Can you promise that I will come back?

623
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:45,141
No.

624
00:37:45,142 --> 00:37:47,978
And if you do...

625
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:51,856
...you will not be the same.

626
00:37:51,857 --> 00:37:54,693
That's what I thought.

627
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:59,364
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this.

628
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:04,365
You've got the wrong Hobbit.

629
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:12,711
It appears we have lost our burglar.

630
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:14,921
Probably for the best.

631
00:38:14,922 --> 00:38:17,465
The odds were always against us.

632
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:20,969
After all, what are we?

633
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,389
Merchants, miners...

634
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,766
...tinkers, toy-makers.

635
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:30,186
Heh, heh. Hardly the stuff of legend.

636
00:38:30,187 --> 00:38:33,690
There are a few warriors amongst us.

637
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:35,775
Old warriors.

638
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,361
I would take each and every one
of these Dwarves...

639
00:38:38,362 --> 00:38:40,655
...over an army from the Iron Hills.

640
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:44,326
For when I called upon them,
they answered.

641
00:38:44,327 --> 00:38:47,287
Loyalty, honor...

642
00:38:47,288 --> 00:38:50,707
...a willing heart.

643
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:53,627
I can ask no more than that.

644
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:54,544
You don't...

645
00:38:54,545 --> 00:38:56,463
...have to do this.

646
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:58,298
You have a choice.

647
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:02,093
You've done honorably by our people.

648
00:39:02,094 --> 00:39:06,181
You have built a new life for us
in the Blue Mountains.

649
00:39:06,182 --> 00:39:07,474
A life of peace...

650
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:10,060
...and plenty.

651
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:15,061
A life that is worth more than
all the gold in Erebor.

652
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:20,566
From my grandfather to my father,
this has come to me.

653
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:23,239
They dreamt of the day...

654
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,827
...when the Dwarves of Erebor
would reclaim their homeland.

655
00:39:27,828 --> 00:39:31,706
There is no choice, Balin.

656
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:35,669
Not for me.

657
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,964
Then we are with you, laddie.

658
00:39:39,965 --> 00:39:44,886
We will see it done.

659
00:40:03,698 --> 00:40:07,200
<i>Far over

660
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:12,201
<i>The misty mountains cold

661
00:40:12,665 --> 00:40:17,168
<i>To dungeons deep

662
00:40:17,169 --> 00:40:21,840
<i>And caverns old

663
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:26,553
<i>We must away

664
00:40:26,554 --> 00:40:31,516
<i>'Ere break of day

665
00:40:31,517 --> 00:40:35,270
<i>To find our

666
00:40:35,271 --> 00:40:40,233
<i>Long-forgotten gold

667
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:43,987
<i>The pines were roaring

668
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:48,988
<i>On the height

669
00:40:49,285 --> 00:40:50,285
<i>The winds

670
00:40:50,286 --> 00:40:53,246
<i>Were moaning

671
00:40:53,247 --> 00:40:58,247
<i>In the night

672
00:40:58,252 --> 00:41:02,714
<i>The fire was red

673
00:41:02,715 --> 00:41:07,469
<i>It flaming spread

674
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:11,306
<i>The trees like torches

675
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:16,307
<i>Blazed With light

676
00:41:55,434 --> 00:42:00,434
Hello?

677
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:08,988
Yes.

678
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:13,989
Yes.

679
00:43:22,938 --> 00:43:24,105
Here...

680
00:43:24,106 --> 00:43:26,024
...Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?

681
00:43:26,025 --> 00:43:28,610
- Can't stop, I'm already late!
- Late for what?

682
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:33,611
I'm going on an adventure!

683
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,747
I said it. Didn't I say it?
Corning here was a waste of time.

684
00:43:40,748 --> 00:43:42,498
That's true enough.

685
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:45,543
Ridiculous notion. Use a Hobbit?
A Halfling?

686
00:43:45,544 --> 00:43:47,128
Whose idea was it anyway?

687
00:43:47,129 --> 00:43:49,005
Wait!

688
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:50,256
Wait!

689
00:43:50,257 --> 00:43:52,008
Whoa, whoa.

690
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:58,510
Whoa, whoa.

691
00:44:01,268 --> 00:44:04,562
I signed it.

692
00:44:04,563 --> 00:44:09,563
Here.

693
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,282
Everything appears...

694
00:44:16,283 --> 00:44:17,909
...to be in order.

695
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,870
Welcome, Master Baggins...

696
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:24,707
...to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.

697
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:31,464
Give him a pony.

698
00:44:31,465 --> 00:44:33,257
No, no, that won't be necessary.

699
00:44:33,258 --> 00:44:35,635
Thank you. I'm sure I can keep up on foot.

700
00:44:35,636 --> 00:44:38,388
I've done my fair share of walking holidays,
you know?

701
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:43,389
Even got as far as Frogmorton once. Aah!

702
00:44:54,321 --> 00:44:58,199
Come on, Nori. Pay up.

703
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,451
- One more.
- ks, lad.

704
00:45:00,452 --> 00:45:02,203
What's that about?

705
00:45:02,204 --> 00:45:06,916
Oh, they took wagers
on whether or not you'd turn up.

706
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:11,087
Most of them bet that you wouldn't.

707
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:12,880
And what did you think?

708
00:45:12,881 --> 00:45:17,468
Well...

709
00:45:17,469 --> 00:45:22,469
My dear fellow,
I never doubted you for a second.

710
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:31,107
It's horse hair. Having a reaction.

711
00:45:32,484 --> 00:45:34,736
No, wait, wait, stop.

712
00:45:34,737 --> 00:45:37,155
Stop! We have to turn around.

713
00:45:37,156 --> 00:45:38,322
What on earth...

714
00:45:38,323 --> 00:45:39,365
...is the matter?

715
00:45:39,366 --> 00:45:43,161
- I forgot my handkerchief.
- Here.

716
00:45:43,162 --> 00:45:47,123
Use this.

717
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:53,625
Move on.

718
00:45:57,301 --> 00:46:00,303
<i>You'll have to manage
without pocket handkerchiefs...

719
00:46:00,304 --> 00:46:02,805
<i>...and a good many other things,
Bilbo Baggins...

720
00:46:02,806 --> 00:46:06,768
<i>...before we reach our journey's end.

721
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:07,769
<i>You were born...

722
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:12,770
<i>...to the rolling hills
and little rivers of the Shire.

723
00:46:13,192 --> 00:46:16,277
<i>But home is now behind you.

724
00:46:16,278 --> 00:46:21,278
<i>The world is ahead.

725
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:05,030
Hello, girl. Who's a good girl?

726
00:47:06,995 --> 00:47:09,122
It's our little secret, Myrtle.

727
00:47:09,123 --> 00:47:11,290
You must tell no one. Shh, shh.

728
00:47:15,796 --> 00:47:18,214
What was that?

729
00:47:18,215 --> 00:47:19,966
<i>Orcs.

730
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:22,677
Orcs?

731
00:47:22,678 --> 00:47:23,719
Throat-cutters.

732
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,805
There'll be dozens of them out there.

733
00:47:25,806 --> 00:47:26,848
The lone-lands...

734
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:29,016
...are crawling with them.
- They strike...

735
00:47:29,017 --> 00:47:33,062
...in the wee small hours when everyone's
asleep. Quick and quiet, no screams.

736
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:37,608
Just lots of blood.

737
00:47:38,902 --> 00:47:42,446
You think that's funny?

738
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:45,616
You think a night raid by Orcs is a joke?

739
00:47:45,617 --> 00:47:48,244
We didn't mean anything by it.

740
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:50,329
No, you didn't.

741
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:54,292
You know nothing of the world.

742
00:47:54,293 --> 00:47:56,711
Don't mind him, laddie.

743
00:47:56,712 --> 00:48:01,712
Thorin has more cause than most
to hate Orcs.

744
00:48:06,054 --> 00:48:09,473
After the dragon took the Lonely Mountain...

745
00:48:09,474 --> 00:48:10,766
...King Thror...

746
00:48:10,767 --> 00:48:15,767
...tried to reclaim
the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria.

747
00:48:17,149 --> 00:48:22,149
<i>But our enemy had got there first.

748
00:48:32,748 --> 00:48:37,501
<i>Moria had been taken by legions of Orcs...

749
00:48:37,502 --> 00:48:39,587
<i>...led by the most vile...

750
00:48:39,588 --> 00:48:42,173
<i>...of all their race...

751
00:48:42,174 --> 00:48:43,000
<i>Azog...

752
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,500
<font color=#FF0000>Goryagug!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(You will all die!)</font>

753
00:48:44,593 --> 00:48:47,595
<i>...the Defiler.

754
00:48:47,596 --> 00:48:50,765
<i>The giant Gundabad Orc...

755
00:48:50,766 --> 00:48:55,766
...had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin.

756
00:48:59,942 --> 00:49:02,777
He began...

757
00:49:02,778 --> 00:49:04,862
...by beheading the king.

758
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:20,127
No!

759
00:49:20,128 --> 00:49:22,380
Thrain, Thorin's father...

760
00:49:22,381 --> 00:49:25,174
...was driven mad by grief.

761
00:49:25,175 --> 00:49:28,386
He went missing. Taken prisoner or killed...

762
00:49:28,387 --> 00:49:31,305
...we did not know.

763
00:49:31,306 --> 00:49:33,557
We were leaderless.

764
00:49:33,558 --> 00:49:37,311
<i>Defeat and death...

765
00:49:37,312 --> 00:49:42,066
<i>...were upon us.

766
00:49:42,067 --> 00:49:47,067
That is when I saw him.

767
00:49:48,156 --> 00:49:50,825
A young Dwarf prince...

768
00:49:50,826 --> 00:49:52,451
<i>...facing down...

769
00:49:52,452 --> 00:49:57,452
<i>...the pale Orc.

770
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:00,251
<i>He stood alone...

771
00:50:00,252 --> 00:50:02,545
<i>...against this terrible foe.

772
00:50:12,055 --> 00:50:13,889
<i>His armor rent...

773
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:14,849
...wielding nothing...

774
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:16,600
<i>...but an oaken branch...

775
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:21,601
<i>...as a shield.

776
00:50:30,407 --> 00:50:31,407
<i>Azog...

777
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:35,661
<i>...the Defiler learned that day...

778
00:50:35,662 --> 00:50:40,662
...that the line of Durin
would not be so easily broken.

779
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:51,600
<font color=#FF8000>Mim nu tar√¢g! Du bek√¢r!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(No more curved on the beards! To arms!)</font>

780
00:51:07,944 --> 00:51:11,364
<i>Our forces rallied...

781
00:51:11,365 --> 00:51:15,034
<i>...and drove the Orcs back.

782
00:51:15,035 --> 00:51:17,161
<i>And our enemy...

783
00:51:17,162 --> 00:51:20,623
<i>...had been defeated.

784
00:51:20,624 --> 00:51:23,667
But there was no feast...

785
00:51:23,668 --> 00:51:26,629
...nor song that night...

786
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:31,630
<i>...for our dead
were beyond the count of grief.

787
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:37,469
<i>We few had survived.

788
00:51:42,979 --> 00:51:47,979
<i>And I thought to myself then...

789
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:53,652
<i>...there is one who I could follow.

790
00:51:55,158 --> 00:51:58,035
There is one...

791
00:51:58,036 --> 00:52:03,036
...I could call king.

792
00:52:18,974 --> 00:52:22,685
And the pale Orc?

793
00:52:22,686 --> 00:52:24,353
What happened to him?

794
00:52:24,354 --> 00:52:28,315
He slunk back into the hole
whence he came.

795
00:52:28,316 --> 00:52:33,316
That filth died of his wounds long ago.

796
00:52:55,177 --> 00:52:57,000
{\an8}<font color=#FF0000>Zidgar durgim...</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(Inform our master...)</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>(...we've found the dwarf-maggot!)</font>

798
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:19,617
Here, Mr. Gandalf...

799
00:53:19,618 --> 00:53:22,244
...can't you do something
about this deluge?

800
00:53:22,245 --> 00:53:24,872
It is raining, Master Dwarf...

801
00:53:24,873 --> 00:53:29,126
...and it will continue to rain
until the rain is done.

802
00:53:29,127 --> 00:53:30,836
If you wish to change...

803
00:53:30,837 --> 00:53:34,924
...the weather of the world,
find yourself another Wizard.

804
00:53:34,925 --> 00:53:36,383
- Are there any?
- What?

805
00:53:36,384 --> 00:53:39,136
- Other Wizards.
- There are five of us.

806
00:53:39,137 --> 00:53:43,849
The greatest of our order
is Saruman the White.

807
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:47,603
Then there are the two Blue Wizards...

808
00:53:47,604 --> 00:53:51,148
Do you know,
I've quite forgotten their names.

809
00:53:51,149 --> 00:53:52,608
And who is the fifth?

810
00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:56,737
Well, that would be Radagast the Brown.

811
00:53:56,738 --> 00:54:01,738
Is he a great Wizard?
Or is he more like you?

812
00:54:02,536 --> 00:54:07,498
I think he's a very great Wizard,
in his own way.

813
00:54:07,499 --> 00:54:08,791
He's a gentle soul...

814
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:12,211
...who prefers the company
of animals to others.

815
00:54:12,212 --> 00:54:15,464
He keeps a watchful eye
over the vast forest lands...

816
00:54:15,465 --> 00:54:18,175
<i>...to the east. And a good thing too.

817
00:54:18,176 --> 00:54:23,176
<i>For always evil will look to find
a foothold in this world.

818
00:54:29,688 --> 00:54:34,688
Not good. Not good at all.

819
00:54:40,365 --> 00:54:45,365
Eww.

820
00:54:57,007 --> 00:54:59,675
Oh, no. Sebastian.

821
00:55:03,054 --> 00:55:08,054
Good gracious.

822
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,369
Come on. Move back! Give him some air...

823
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:32,370
...for goodness sake.

824
00:55:39,215 --> 00:55:42,217
There. There.

825
00:55:42,218 --> 00:55:45,721
I don't understand why it's not working.

826
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:50,517
It's not as if it's witchcraft.

827
00:55:50,518 --> 00:55:53,896
Witchcraft.

828
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:58,897
Oh, but it is.

829
00:55:58,902 --> 00:56:03,902
A dark and powerful magic.

830
00:56:45,323 --> 00:56:53,000
<font color=#0080C0>Lerya laman naiquentallo. Celvameld√´, s√≠ a hlar√´ √≥maquettar.

833
00:57:36,374 --> 00:57:37,374
Where on...

834
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:41,170
...this good earth
did those foul creatures come from?

835
00:57:43,173 --> 00:57:45,466
The old fortress?

836
00:57:45,467 --> 00:57:47,000
Show me.

837
00:58:20,251 --> 00:58:22,461
We'll camp here for the night.

838
00:58:22,462 --> 00:58:27,090
Fili, Kili, look after the ponies.
Make sure you stay with them.

839
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:31,345
A farmer and his family used to live here.

840
00:58:31,346 --> 00:58:34,306
- Oin, Gloin. Get a fire going.
- Aye.

841
00:58:34,307 --> 00:58:35,516
Right you are.

842
00:58:35,517 --> 00:58:40,103
I think it would be wiser to move on.

843
00:58:40,104 --> 00:58:43,273
We could make for the Hidden Valley.

844
00:58:43,274 --> 00:58:45,359
I have told you already...

845
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,402
...I will not go near that place.

846
00:58:47,403 --> 00:58:49,863
Why not? The Elves could help us.

847
00:58:49,864 --> 00:58:52,115
We could get food, rest, advice.

848
00:58:52,116 --> 00:58:55,536
- I do not need their advice.
- We have a map...

849
00:58:55,537 --> 00:58:58,622
...that we cannot read.
Lord Elrond could help us.

850
00:58:58,623 --> 00:59:00,999
Help?

851
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,293
A dragon attacks Erebor.

852
00:59:03,294 --> 00:59:06,588
What help came from the Elves?

853
00:59:06,589 --> 00:59:08,715
Orcs plunder Moria...

854
00:59:08,716 --> 00:59:12,427
...desecrate our sacred halls.
The Elves looked on...

855
00:59:12,428 --> 00:59:15,138
...and did nothing.

856
00:59:15,139 --> 00:59:19,393
And you ask me to seek out the very people
who betrayed my grandfather.

857
00:59:19,394 --> 00:59:20,853
Who betrayed my father.

858
00:59:20,854 --> 00:59:23,397
You are neither of them.

859
00:59:23,398 --> 00:59:24,314
I did not...

860
00:59:24,315 --> 00:59:27,276
...give you that map and key
for you to hold onto the past.

861
00:59:27,277 --> 00:59:32,277
I did not know
that they were yours to keep.

862
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:38,328
Everything all right?
Gandalf, where are you going?

863
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:41,915
To seek the company of the
only one around here who's got any sense.

864
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:42,875
And who's that?

865
00:59:42,876 --> 00:59:45,002
Myself, Mr. Baggins.

866
00:59:45,003 --> 00:59:49,423
I've had enough of Dwarves for one day.

867
00:59:49,424 --> 00:59:52,050
Come on, Bombur, we're hungry.

868
00:59:52,051 --> 00:59:57,051
Is he coming back?

869
00:59:58,641 --> 01:00:00,142
He's been a long time.

870
01:00:00,143 --> 01:00:01,602
- Who?
- Gandalf.

871
01:00:01,603 --> 01:00:03,937
He's a Wizard. He does as he chooses.

872
01:00:03,938 --> 01:00:07,524
Here, do us a favor. Take this to the lads.

873
01:00:07,525 --> 01:00:09,276
Stop it. You've had plenty.

874
01:00:09,277 --> 01:00:13,113
Aye, it's not a bad stew, Bombur.
I've had worse.

875
01:00:13,114 --> 01:00:15,324
Dori could've cooked it. Ha-ha-ha.

876
01:00:15,325 --> 01:00:20,325
Hilarious.

877
01:00:28,212 --> 01:00:29,713
What's the matter?

878
01:00:29,714 --> 01:00:34,301
- We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.
- Only we've encountered a slight problem.

879
01:00:34,302 --> 01:00:36,386
We had 16.

880
01:00:36,387 --> 01:00:41,387
Now there's 14.

881
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:45,020
Daisy and Bungo are missing.

882
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:46,939
Well, that's not good. Ha, ha.

883
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,733
And that is not good at all.
Shouldn't we tell Thorin?

884
01:00:49,734 --> 01:00:52,819
Uh, no. Let's not worry him.

885
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,239
As our official burglar,
we thought you might like to look into it.

886
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,116
Well, uh...

887
01:00:58,117 --> 01:01:02,496
- Look, something big uprooted these trees.
- That was our thinking.

888
01:01:02,497 --> 01:01:07,497
It's something very big
and possibly quite dangerous.

889
01:01:07,794 --> 01:01:09,419
Hey...

890
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,588
There's a light.

891
01:01:11,589 --> 01:01:15,509
Over here.

892
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:18,220
Stay down.

893
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:23,642
What is it?

894
01:01:23,643 --> 01:01:28,643
Trolls.

895
01:01:43,371 --> 01:01:44,621
Oh.

896
01:01:51,963 --> 01:01:56,963
He's got Myrtle and Minty. I think they're
gonna eat them. We have to do something.

897
01:01:58,011 --> 01:02:00,053
Yes, you should.

898
01:02:00,054 --> 01:02:01,680
Mountain Trolls are slow...

899
01:02:01,681 --> 01:02:04,307
...and stupid, and you're small,
they'll never see you.

900
01:02:04,308 --> 01:02:06,476
It's perfectly safe. We'll be behind you.

901
01:02:06,477 --> 01:02:08,603
If you run into trouble,
hoot twice like a barn owl...

902
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:10,188
...and once like a brown owl.

903
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:13,275
 Twice like a barn owl.
No, twice like a brown... Once like a...

904
01:02:13,276 --> 01:02:15,652
Like a... Are you sure this is a good idea?

905
01:02:15,653 --> 01:02:18,864
Mutton yesterday, mutton today...

906
01:02:18,865 --> 01:02:23,452
...and, blimey, if it don't look like
mutton again tomorrow.

907
01:02:23,453 --> 01:02:25,620
Quit your griping.

908
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:30,042
These ain't sheep. These is fresh nags.

909
01:02:30,043 --> 01:02:34,421
Oh! I don't like horse. I never have.

910
01:02:34,422 --> 01:02:36,715
- Not enough fat on them.
- Well, it's better...

911
01:02:36,716 --> 01:02:39,593
...than leathery old farmer.
All skin and bone, he was.

912
01:02:39,594 --> 01:02:40,761
I'm still picking...

913
01:02:40,762 --> 01:02:42,596
...bits of him out of me teeth.

914
01:02:43,765 --> 01:02:47,100
Well, that's lovely, that is. A floater.

915
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:49,227
Might improve the flavor.

916
01:02:49,228 --> 01:02:51,980
Ah. There's more where that came from.

917
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:53,523
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Ow!

918
01:02:57,111 --> 01:03:00,906
Sit down!

919
01:03:07,163 --> 01:03:11,583
Well, I hope you're gonna gut these nags.

920
01:03:11,584 --> 01:03:14,586
I don't like the stinky parts.

921
01:03:14,587 --> 01:03:17,589
- Ow!
- I said sit down.

922
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:18,799
I'm starving!

923
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,052
Now, are we having horse tonight or what?

924
01:03:22,053 --> 01:03:24,179
Shut your cakehole.

925
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:26,973
You'll eat what I give you.

926
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:30,852
How come he's the cook?
Everything tastes the same.

927
01:03:30,853 --> 01:03:32,604
Everything tastes like chicken.

928
01:03:32,605 --> 01:03:34,022
Except the chicken.

929
01:03:34,023 --> 01:03:35,482
What tastes like fish!

930
01:03:35,483 --> 01:03:38,735
I'm just saying,
a little appreciation would be nice.

931
01:03:41,114 --> 01:03:43,740
Oh. "Thank you very much, Bert.

932
01:03:43,741 --> 01:03:45,117
Lovely stew, Bert."

933
01:03:45,118 --> 01:03:49,371
- How hard is that?
- Shh. Shh, shh. Shh.

934
01:03:49,372 --> 01:03:50,330
Just needs...

935
01:03:50,331 --> 01:03:53,375
...a sprinkle of squirrel dung.

936
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:54,292
Here...

937
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:55,544
...that's my grog.

938
01:03:58,005 --> 01:04:02,884
Sorry. Ow!

939
01:04:02,885 --> 01:04:07,681
Ooh. That is beautifully balanced, that is.

940
01:04:07,682 --> 01:04:11,601
Wrap your laughing gear around that, eh?

941
01:04:11,602 --> 01:04:13,019
Good, isn't it?

942
01:04:14,564 --> 01:04:17,607
That's why I'm the cook.

943
01:04:24,907 --> 01:04:29,327
Oh, me guts are grumbling.
I got to snaffle something.

944
01:04:29,328 --> 01:04:32,581
- Flesh, I need flesh.
- Ah! Ah!

945
01:04:35,501 --> 01:04:37,294
Blimey!

946
01:04:37,295 --> 01:04:40,380
Bert. Bert!
Look what's come out of me hooter.

947
01:04:40,381 --> 01:04:42,799
It's got arms and legs and everything.

948
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,218
- What is it?
- I don't know.

949
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:50,219
I don't like the way it wriggles around.

950
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,519
What are you, then? An oversized squirrel?

951
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,396
I'm a burglar... Uh, Hobbit.

952
01:04:56,397 --> 01:04:58,648
A burglar Hobbit?

953
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:00,442
Can we cook him?

954
01:05:00,443 --> 01:05:05,443
We can try.

955
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,033
He wouldn't make more than a mouthful.

956
01:05:08,034 --> 01:05:10,994
Not when he's skinned and boned.

957
01:05:10,995 --> 01:05:12,579
Perhaps there's more...

958
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:15,207
...burglar Hobbits around these parts.
Might be enough...

959
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:17,459
...for a pie.

960
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,628
- Grab him!
- He's too quick.

961
01:05:19,629 --> 01:05:23,131
Right. Come here, you little...

962
01:05:23,132 --> 01:05:24,633
Gotcha.

963
01:05:24,634 --> 01:05:27,093
Are there any more of you little fellas...

964
01:05:27,094 --> 01:05:30,263
- ...hiding where you shouldn't?
- No.

965
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:31,806
He's lying.

966
01:05:31,807 --> 01:05:36,311
- No, I'm not!
- Hold his toes over the fire.

967
01:05:36,312 --> 01:05:39,481
Make him squeal!

968
01:05:42,443 --> 01:05:43,693
Drop him!

969
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:45,862
You what?

970
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:47,614
I said...

971
01:05:47,615 --> 01:05:48,865
...drop him.

972
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,056
Get the sacks!

973
01:06:13,057 --> 01:06:16,393
Stick them in the sacks!

974
01:06:37,623 --> 01:06:42,623
Ow!

975
01:07:04,567 --> 01:07:05,483
Come on!

976
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:07,110
Get up!

977
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:10,030
- Bilbo!
- Don't!

978
01:07:10,031 --> 01:07:12,699
Lay down your arms...

979
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:17,700
...or we'll rip his off.

980
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:33,136
- Oh! That's hot, that's hot, that's hot!
- Don't bother cooking them.

981
01:07:33,137 --> 01:07:37,557
Let's just sit on them
and squash them into jelly.

982
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:41,936
They should be sauteed and grilled
with a sprinkle of sage.

983
01:07:41,937 --> 01:07:43,646
Is this really necessary?

984
01:07:43,647 --> 01:07:45,607
That does sound quite nice.

985
01:07:45,608 --> 01:07:48,735
 - Untie me, mister.
- Eat someone your own size.

986
01:07:48,736 --> 01:07:50,820
Never mind the seasoning.

987
01:07:50,821 --> 01:07:53,573
We ain't got all night. Dawn ain't...

988
01:07:53,574 --> 01:07:56,284
...far away. Let's get a move on.

989
01:07:56,285 --> 01:08:01,285
I don't fancy being turned to stone.

990
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:02,916
Wait!

991
01:08:02,917 --> 01:08:04,250
You are making...

992
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:06,127
...a terrible mistake.

993
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:07,670
You can't reason with them.

994
01:08:07,671 --> 01:08:09,130
- They're half-wits!
- Half-wits?

995
01:08:09,131 --> 01:08:11,174
What does that make us?

996
01:08:11,175 --> 01:08:13,134
I meant with...

997
01:08:13,135 --> 01:08:14,302
...the seasoning.

998
01:08:14,303 --> 01:08:17,138
What about the seasoning?

999
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:18,681
Well, have you smelt them?

1000
01:08:18,682 --> 01:08:22,435
You're gonna need something stronger
than sage before you plate this lot up.

1001
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:24,062
- Traitor!
 - What do you know...

1002
01:08:24,063 --> 01:08:26,106
...about cooking Dwarf?

1003
01:08:26,107 --> 01:08:27,440
Shut up.

1004
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:32,028
Let the flurgaburburhobbit talk.

1005
01:08:32,029 --> 01:08:35,156
The secret to cooking Dwarf is...

1006
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:38,451
- Yes? Come on. Tell us the secret.
- It's, uh...

1007
01:08:38,452 --> 01:08:42,997
Yes, I'm telling you. The secret is...

1008
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:44,958
...to skin them first.

1009
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:47,961
What? Skin us?

1010
01:08:47,962 --> 01:08:49,754
Tom, get me filleting knife.

1011
01:08:49,755 --> 01:08:51,589
I'll skin you, you little...!

1012
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:53,591
I won't forget that. I won't forget it.

1013
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:56,136
What a load of rubbish.

1014
01:08:56,137 --> 01:08:59,222
I've eaten plenty with their skins on.

1015
01:08:59,223 --> 01:09:00,348
Scarf them, I say...

1016
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:02,225
...boots and all.

1017
01:09:02,226 --> 01:09:04,686
He's right.

1018
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:09,687
Nothing wrong with a bit of raw Dwarf.

1019
01:09:09,984 --> 01:09:12,527
Nice and crunchy.

1020
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:13,945
Oh, not that one.

1021
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:15,280
He's infected.

1022
01:09:15,281 --> 01:09:16,197
Huh?

1023
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:17,198
You what?

1024
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:21,494
Yeah, he's got worms in his tubes.

1025
01:09:21,495 --> 01:09:22,495
Eww!

1026
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:23,663
Aah!

1027
01:09:23,664 --> 01:09:25,415
In fact, they all have.

1028
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:28,209
They're infested with parasites.
It's a terrible business.

1029
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:30,128
I wouldn't risk it. I wouldn't.

1030
01:09:30,129 --> 01:09:31,045
Parasites?

1031
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:33,131
Did he say "parasites"?

1032
01:09:33,132 --> 01:09:35,884
We don't have parasites.
You have parasites!

1033
01:09:35,885 --> 01:09:38,011
What are you talking about, laddie?

1034
01:09:41,307 --> 01:09:43,349
I've got parasites as big as my arm.

1035
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:46,144
Mine are the biggest parasites.
I've got huge parasites.

1036
01:09:48,022 --> 01:09:49,689
- We're riddled.
 - Yes, I'm riddled.

1037
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:51,107
Yes, we are, badly.

1038
01:09:51,108 --> 01:09:54,152
What would you have us do, then?

1039
01:09:54,153 --> 01:09:56,029
Let them all go?

1040
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:57,697
- Well...
 - You think...

1041
01:09:57,698 --> 01:09:59,782
...I don't know what you're up to?

1042
01:09:59,783 --> 01:10:00,867
This little...

1043
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:04,120
...ferret is taking us for fools.

1044
01:10:04,121 --> 01:10:05,121
Ferret?

1045
01:10:05,122 --> 01:10:06,080
Fools?

1046
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:10,418
The dawn will take you all.

1047
01:10:10,419 --> 01:10:11,377
Who's that?

1048
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:12,295
No idea.

1049
01:10:12,296 --> 01:10:16,758
Can we eat him too?

1050
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:42,450
Get your foot out of my back.

1051
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:51,334
Ah.

1052
01:10:51,335 --> 01:10:52,335
Where did you...

1053
01:10:52,336 --> 01:10:53,920
...go to, if I may ask?

1054
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:55,922
To look ahead.

1055
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:57,090
What brought you back?

1056
01:10:57,091 --> 01:10:59,759
Looking behind.

1057
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,177
Nasty business.

1058
01:11:01,178 --> 01:11:02,929
Still, they're all in one piece.

1059
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:05,765
No thanks to your burglar.

1060
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:09,269
He had the nous to play for time.

1061
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:13,731
None of the rest of you thought of that.

1062
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:16,859
They must have come down
from the Ettenmoors.

1063
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,862
Since when do Mountain Trolls
venture this far south?

1064
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:22,657
Ooh. Not for an age.

1065
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:27,658
Not since a darker power ruled these lands.

1066
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:36,045
They could not have moved in daylight.

1067
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:40,341
There must be a cave nearby.

1068
01:11:49,101 --> 01:11:51,603
Oh, what's that stench?

1069
01:11:51,604 --> 01:11:55,064
It's a Troll-hoard.

1070
01:11:55,065 --> 01:11:57,859
Be careful what you touch.

1071
01:12:10,122 --> 01:12:12,081
Seems a shame just to leave it...

1072
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:15,293
...lying around.

1073
01:12:15,294 --> 01:12:17,420
- Anyone could take it.
- Agreed.

1074
01:12:17,421 --> 01:12:19,255
- Nori.
- Yeah?

1075
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:24,256
Get a shovel.

1076
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:42,858
These swords were not made by any Troll.

1077
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:50,908
Nor were they made
by any smith among Men.

1078
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:57,126
These were forged in Gondolin...

1079
01:12:57,127 --> 01:13:01,798
...by the High Elves of the First Age.
You could not...

1080
01:13:01,799 --> 01:13:06,799
...wish for a finer blade.

1081
01:13:17,314 --> 01:13:20,108
- Set it down.
- That's good.

1082
01:13:20,109 --> 01:13:25,109
All right, come on. Quick.

1083
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:33,413
We're making a long-term deposit.

1084
01:13:33,414 --> 01:13:35,415
Let's get out of this foul place.

1085
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:37,291
Come on, let's go.

1086
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:42,292
Bofur, Gloin, Nori.

1087
01:13:58,731 --> 01:14:01,899
- Bilbo.
- Hmm?

1088
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,151
Here.

1089
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:08,152
This is about your size.

1090
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:13,077
I can't take this.

1091
01:14:13,078 --> 01:14:15,288
The blade is of Elvish make...

1092
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:16,998
...which means...

1093
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:21,377
...it will glow blue
when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.

1094
01:14:21,378 --> 01:14:23,921
I have never used a sword in my life.

1095
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:26,799
And I hope you never have to.

1096
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,886
But if you do, remember this...

1097
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:34,887
True courage is about knowing
not when to take a life...

1098
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:40,851
...but when to spare one.

1099
01:14:43,442 --> 01:14:45,151
Something's coming!

1100
01:14:45,152 --> 01:14:46,068
Gandalf.

1101
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:47,862
Stay together!

1102
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:49,530
Hurry now!

1103
01:14:49,531 --> 01:14:54,531
Arm yourselves!

1104
01:15:09,259 --> 01:15:10,218
Thieves!

1105
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:14,347
Fire! Murder!

1106
01:15:14,348 --> 01:15:16,724
Radagast.

1107
01:15:16,725 --> 01:15:18,851
It's Radagast the Brown.

1108
01:15:18,852 --> 01:15:22,730
Well...

1109
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:24,607
What on earth are you doing here?

1110
01:15:24,608 --> 01:15:26,317
I was looking for you, Gandalf.

1111
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:27,860
Something's wrong.

1112
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:30,154
Something's terribly wrong.

1113
01:15:30,155 --> 01:15:33,825
Yes?

1114
01:15:33,826 --> 01:15:36,744
Oh.

1115
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:38,913
Just give me a minute.

1116
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:42,083
Oh. I had a thought and now I've lost it.

1117
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:43,835
It was right there...

1118
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:46,045
...on the tip of my tongue.

1119
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:47,004
Oh.

1120
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:49,423
It's not a thought at all.

1121
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:52,218
It's a silly old...

1122
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:57,219
...stick insect.

1123
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:02,353
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf.

1124
01:16:02,354 --> 01:16:04,730
A darkness has fallen over it.

1125
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:07,108
Nothing grows anymore.

1126
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:09,360
At least, nothing good.

1127
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:12,196
The air is foul with decay.

1128
01:16:12,197 --> 01:16:14,156
But worse are the webs.

1129
01:16:14,157 --> 01:16:16,492
Webs? What do you mean?

1130
01:16:16,493 --> 01:16:18,786
Spiders, Gandalf.

1131
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:20,371
Giant ones.

1132
01:16:20,372 --> 01:16:25,042
Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant,
or I am not a Wizard.

1133
01:16:25,043 --> 01:16:27,295
I followed their trail.

1134
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:31,173
They came from Dol Guldur.

1135
01:16:31,174 --> 01:16:33,009
Huh?

1136
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:35,219
Dol Guldur?

1137
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:39,265
But the old fortress is abandoned.

1138
01:16:39,266 --> 01:16:42,435
No, Gandalf.

1139
01:16:42,436 --> 01:16:47,436
'Tis not.

1140
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:55,615
<i>A dark power dwells in there...

1141
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:57,742
<i>...such as I have never...

1142
01:16:57,743 --> 01:17:00,786
<i>...felt before.

1143
01:17:00,787 --> 01:17:05,787
<i>It is the shadow of an ancient horror.

1144
01:17:11,214 --> 01:17:15,051
<i>One that can summon the spirits...

1145
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:20,052
<i>...of the dead.

1146
01:17:33,278 --> 01:17:35,905
<i>I saw him, Gandalf.

1147
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:38,950
<i>From out of the darkness...

1148
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:41,160
<i>...a Necromancer...

1149
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:42,954
<i>...has come.

1150
01:17:42,955 --> 01:17:47,041
Radagast.

1151
01:17:50,629 --> 01:17:55,216
Quick! Quick, quick! Quick, quick!

1152
01:17:55,217 --> 01:18:00,217
Wait for me!

1153
01:18:10,607 --> 01:18:12,024
Sorry.

1154
01:18:12,025 --> 01:18:14,610
Try a little Old Toby.

1155
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:19,611
It'll help settle your nerves.

1156
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,283
And out.

1157
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,542
Now...

1158
01:18:29,543 --> 01:18:34,543
...a Necromancer. Are you sure?

1159
01:18:46,601 --> 01:18:48,310
That is not...

1160
01:18:48,311 --> 01:18:53,311
...from the world of the living.

1161
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,282
Was that a wolf?
Are there wolves out there?

1162
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:04,326
Wolves? No, that is not a wolf.

1163
01:19:09,624 --> 01:19:14,624
Kili! Get your bow!

1164
01:19:18,383 --> 01:19:20,051
Warg scouts.

1165
01:19:20,052 --> 01:19:22,261
Which means an Orc pack is not far behind.

1166
01:19:22,262 --> 01:19:23,387
Orc pack?

1167
01:19:23,388 --> 01:19:24,972
Who did you tell about your quest...

1168
01:19:24,973 --> 01:19:26,640
...beyond your kin?

1169
01:19:26,641 --> 01:19:27,558
No one.

1170
01:19:27,559 --> 01:19:28,476
Who did you tell?

1171
01:19:28,477 --> 01:19:30,269
No one, I swear.

1172
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:31,187
What in...

1173
01:19:31,188 --> 01:19:32,438
...Durin's name is going on?

1174
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:35,274
You are being hunted.

1175
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:36,734
We have to get out of here.

1176
01:19:36,735 --> 01:19:38,110
We can't. We have no ponies.

1177
01:19:39,112 --> 01:19:40,946
They bolted.

1178
01:19:40,947 --> 01:19:42,448
I'll draw them off.

1179
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:44,408
These are Gundabad Wargs.

1180
01:19:44,409 --> 01:19:45,576
They will outrun you.

1181
01:19:45,577 --> 01:19:48,579
These are Rhosgobel rabbits.

1182
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:52,124
I'd like to see them try.

1183
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:00,508
<font color=#FF0000>Kogum!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(There!)</font>

1184
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:02,927
Come on! Come on!

1185
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:05,513
Come and get me! Ha, ha!

1186
01:20:05,514 --> 01:20:07,348
<font color=#FF0000>Zidg!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(Wizard!)</font>

1187
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:19,481
Come on.

1188
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:45,302
Stay together.

1189
01:20:45,303 --> 01:20:50,303
Move!

1190
01:20:57,566 --> 01:21:02,566
Ori, no! Get back.

1191
01:21:03,196 --> 01:21:07,783
All of you, come on. Quick!

1192
01:21:07,784 --> 01:21:12,784
Where are you leading us?

1193
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:08,900
{\an8}<font color=#FF0000>Khozdayin harish huru nar!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(The Dwarves, they travels towards East!)</font>

1194
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,500
{\an8}<font color=#FF0000>Gur!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(Quickly!)</font>

1195
01:22:18,271 --> 01:22:19,563
Move!

1196
01:22:19,564 --> 01:22:24,564
Run!

1197
01:22:37,707 --> 01:22:40,876
There they are!

1198
01:22:40,877 --> 01:22:42,127
This way!

1199
01:22:42,128 --> 01:22:47,128
Quickly!

1200
01:22:54,557 --> 01:22:56,976
There's more coming!

1201
01:22:56,977 --> 01:22:58,143
Kili!

1202
01:22:58,144 --> 01:23:01,000
Shoot them!

1203
01:23:04,025 --> 01:23:05,900
We're surrounded!

1204
01:23:09,948 --> 01:23:11,615
Where's Gandalf?

1205
01:23:11,616 --> 01:23:16,616
He's abandoned us.

1206
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:24,791
Hold your ground!

1207
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,000
<font color=#FF8000>Ithrik√Æ!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(Steady!)</font>

1208
01:23:31,511 --> 01:23:33,679
This way, you fools!

1209
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,000
Come on, move!

1210
01:23:37,183 --> 01:23:38,142
Quickly!

1211
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:39,310
All of you!

1212
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:41,478
Come on!

1213
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:43,000
Go, go, go!

1214
01:23:53,241 --> 01:23:56,493
Eight, nine, 10.

1215
01:23:56,494 --> 01:23:57,453
Kili!

1216
01:23:57,454 --> 01:23:58,704
Run!

1217
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:42,831
Elves.

1218
01:24:42,832 --> 01:24:44,083
I cannot see where the...

1219
01:24:44,084 --> 01:24:46,960
...pathway leads.
Do we follow it or no?

1220
01:24:46,961 --> 01:24:51,961
Follow it, of course.

1221
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:57,050
I think that would be wise.

1222
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:18,867
Gandalf.

1223
01:25:18,868 --> 01:25:20,577
Where are we?

1224
01:25:20,578 --> 01:25:21,703
You can feel it?

1225
01:25:21,704 --> 01:25:26,083
Yes. It feels like...

1226
01:25:26,084 --> 01:25:27,543
Well, like magic.

1227
01:25:27,544 --> 01:25:30,254
That's exactly what it is.

1228
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:33,966
A very powerful magic.

1229
01:25:33,967 --> 01:25:38,967
There's light ahead.

1230
01:26:16,676 --> 01:26:20,679
The Valley of Imladris.

1231
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:24,892
In the common tongue,
it's known by another name.

1232
01:26:24,893 --> 01:26:29,188
Rivendell.

1233
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:34,189
Here lies the Last Homely House
East of the Sea.

1234
01:26:35,111 --> 01:26:38,447
This was your plan all along.

1235
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:40,699
To seek refuge with our enemy.

1236
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:44,203
You have no enemies here,
Thorin Oakenshield.

1237
01:26:44,204 --> 01:26:46,330
The only ill will to be found...

1238
01:26:46,331 --> 01:26:49,416
...in this valley
is that which you bring yourself.

1239
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:53,754
You think the Elves will give our quest
their blessing?

1240
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:55,380
They will try to stop us.

1241
01:26:55,381 --> 01:27:00,381
Of course they will. But we have questions
that need to be answered.

1242
01:27:02,889 --> 01:27:06,683
If we are to be successful,
this will need to be handled with tact.

1243
01:27:06,684 --> 01:27:08,227
And respect.

1244
01:27:08,228 --> 01:27:10,896
And no small degree of charm.

1245
01:27:10,897 --> 01:27:15,897
<i>Which is why you will leave
the talking to me.

1246
01:28:11,374 --> 01:28:13,917
Mithrandir.

1247
01:28:13,918 --> 01:28:14,960
Ah.

1248
01:28:14,961 --> 01:28:16,628
Lindir.

1249
01:28:16,629 --> 01:28:19,172
Stay sharp.

1250
01:28:19,173 --> 01:28:21,675
{\an8}<font color=#008000>Lastannem i athrannedh i Vruinen.
<font color=#FFFF00>(We heard that you had crossed the Loudwater.)</font>

1251
01:28:21,676 --> 01:28:23,760
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

1252
01:28:23,761 --> 01:28:26,179
My Lord Elrond is not here.

1253
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:28,849
Not here?

1254
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:30,309
Where is he?

1255
01:28:43,197 --> 01:28:44,740
<font color=#FF8000>Ifrid√Æ bek√¢r!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(Ready weapons!)</font>

1256
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:49,741
Close ranks!

1257
01:29:10,391 --> 01:29:11,683
Gandalf.

1258
01:29:11,684 --> 01:29:15,354
Lord Elrond.

1259
01:29:15,355 --> 01:29:18,857
{\an8}<font color=#008000>Mellonnen! Mo ev√≠nedh?
<font color=#FFFF00>(My friend! Where have you gone?)</font>

{\an8}<font color=#008000>Farannem 'lamhoth i udul o charad.

<font color=#FFFF00>(We slew a number at the Last Bridge.)</font>

1262
01:29:30,536 --> 01:29:34,790
Strange for Orcs to come
so close to our borders.

1263
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:38,960
Something or someone
has drawn them near.

1264
01:29:38,961 --> 01:29:43,961
Ah. That may have been us.

1265
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:49,805
Welcome, Thorin, son of Thrain.

1266
01:29:49,806 --> 01:29:52,683
I do not believe we have met.

1267
01:29:52,684 --> 01:29:55,936
You have your grandfather's bearing.

1268
01:29:55,937 --> 01:29:57,688
I knew Thror when he ruled...

1269
01:29:57,689 --> 01:30:02,689
- ...Under the Mountain.
- Indeed? He made no mention of you.

1270
01:30:05,363 --> 01:30:08,300
<font color=#008000>Nartho i noer, toltho i viruvor.
<font color=#FFFF00>(Light the fires, fetch the miruvor.)</font>

<font color=#008000>Boe i annam vann a nethail vin.
<font color=#FFFF00>(We must give food to our guests.)</font>

1272
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:15,539
What is he saying?

1273
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:18,166
Does he offer us insult?

1274
01:30:18,167 --> 01:30:23,167
No, Master Gloin, he's offering you food.

1275
01:30:28,469 --> 01:30:29,761
Well...

1276
01:30:29,762 --> 01:30:33,014
...in that case, lead on.

1277
01:30:33,015 --> 01:30:34,391
Hey. Come on.

1278
01:30:34,392 --> 01:30:37,436
Try it. Just a mouthful.

1279
01:30:37,437 --> 01:30:40,230
I don't like green food.

1280
01:30:40,231 --> 01:30:41,398
Where's the meat?

1281
01:30:42,859 --> 01:30:45,318
Have they got any chips?

1282
01:30:45,319 --> 01:30:46,361
Kind of you...

1283
01:30:46,362 --> 01:30:47,988
...to invite us.

1284
01:30:47,989 --> 01:30:49,740
Not really dressed for dinner.

1285
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:51,158
Well, you never are.

1286
01:31:10,553 --> 01:31:14,014
I can't say I fancy Elf maids myself, too thin.

1287
01:31:14,015 --> 01:31:15,807
They're all high cheekbones...

1288
01:31:15,808 --> 01:31:18,101
...and creamy skin.

1289
01:31:18,102 --> 01:31:19,686
Not enough facial hair for me.

1290
01:31:19,687 --> 01:31:24,649
Although that one there is not bad.

1291
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:29,650
That's not an Elf maid.

1292
01:31:38,164 --> 01:31:43,164
That's funny.

1293
01:31:51,219 --> 01:31:55,514
This is Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver.

1294
01:31:55,515 --> 01:31:57,307
A famous blade...

1295
01:31:57,308 --> 01:32:02,308
...forged by the High Elves
of the West, my kin.

1296
01:32:03,356 --> 01:32:05,440
May it serve you well.

1297
01:32:05,441 --> 01:32:06,483
And this...

1298
01:32:06,484 --> 01:32:09,486
...is Glamdring...

1299
01:32:09,487 --> 01:32:11,196
...the Foehammer. Sword...

1300
01:32:11,197 --> 01:32:13,532
...of the King of Gondolin.

1301
01:32:13,533 --> 01:32:16,243
These were made for the Goblin Wars
of the First Age.

1302
01:32:16,244 --> 01:32:17,536
I wouldn't bother, laddie.

1303
01:32:17,537 --> 01:32:21,206
Swords are named
for the great deeds they do in war.

1304
01:32:21,207 --> 01:32:23,959
What are you saying,
my sword hasn't seen battle?

1305
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:27,879
I'm not actually sure it is a sword.

1306
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:31,007
More of a letter opener, really.

1307
01:32:31,008 --> 01:32:32,676
- How did you come by these?
- We found them...

1308
01:32:32,677 --> 01:32:35,512
...in a Troll-hoard on the Great East Road...

1309
01:32:35,513 --> 01:32:36,680
...shortly before...

1310
01:32:36,681 --> 01:32:40,934
- ...we were ambushed by Orcs.
- And what were you doing...

1311
01:32:40,935 --> 01:32:44,271
...on the Great East Road?

1312
01:32:44,272 --> 01:32:49,272
Excuse me.

1313
01:32:53,114 --> 01:32:54,948
Thirteen Dwarves...

1314
01:32:54,949 --> 01:32:56,616
...and a Halfling. Hm.

1315
01:32:56,617 --> 01:32:59,828
Strange traveling companions, Gandalf.

1316
01:32:59,829 --> 01:33:02,581
These are the descendants
of the house of Durin.

1317
01:33:02,582 --> 01:33:04,791
They're noble, decent folk.

1318
01:33:04,792 --> 01:33:07,919
And they're surprisingly cultured.

1319
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:08,920
They've got a deep love...

1320
01:33:08,921 --> 01:33:11,715
- ...of the arts.
- Change the tune, why don't you?

1321
01:33:11,716 --> 01:33:13,550
I feel like I'm at a funeral.

1322
01:33:13,551 --> 01:33:15,176
- Did somebody die?
- All right...

1323
01:33:15,177 --> 01:33:20,177
...lads. There's only one thing for it.

1324
01:33:20,808 --> 01:33:23,226
<i>There's

1325
01:33:23,227 --> 01:33:24,936
<i>An

1326
01:33:24,937 --> 01:33:27,272
<i>Inn, there's an inn
There's a merry old inn

1327
01:33:27,273 --> 01:33:29,190
<i>Beneath an old gray hill

1328
01:33:29,191 --> 01:33:32,652
<i>And there they brew a beer so brown
The Man in the Moon

1329
01:33:32,653 --> 01:33:34,154
<i>Himself came down
One night

1330
01:33:34,155 --> 01:33:35,280
<i>To drink his fill

1331
01:33:35,281 --> 01:33:36,656
<i>Oh

1332
01:33:36,657 --> 01:33:38,408
<i>The ostler has a tipsy cat

1333
01:33:38,409 --> 01:33:40,994
<i>That played a five-stringed fiddle

1334
01:33:40,995 --> 01:33:42,495
<i>And up and down he saws his bow

1335
01:33:42,496 --> 01:33:45,165
<i>Now squeaking high

1336
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:47,792
<i>Now purring low

1337
01:33:49,503 --> 01:33:51,963
<i>Now sawing in the middle

1338
01:33:51,964 --> 01:33:53,214
<i>So

1339
01:33:53,215 --> 01:33:53,965
<i>The cat on the fiddle

1340
01:33:53,966 --> 01:33:56,760
<i>Played hey-diddle-diddle
A jig that'll wake the dead

1341
01:33:56,761 --> 01:33:58,637
<i>He squeaked and he sawed
And he quickened

1342
01:33:58,638 --> 01:33:59,512
<i>The tune
And the landlord

1343
01:33:59,513 --> 01:34:00,472
<i>Shook the Man

1344
01:34:00,473 --> 01:34:01,431
<i>In the Moon
"It's after

1345
01:34:01,432 --> 01:34:02,515
<i>Three!" he said!

1346
01:34:11,067 --> 01:34:13,276
Our business is no concern of Elves.

1347
01:34:13,277 --> 01:34:15,236
For goodness sake, Thorin...

1348
01:34:15,237 --> 01:34:17,113
...show him the map.
- It is the legacy...

1349
01:34:17,114 --> 01:34:18,615
...of my people.

1350
01:34:18,616 --> 01:34:22,369
It is mine to protect, as are its secrets.

1351
01:34:22,370 --> 01:34:25,080
Save me from the stubbornness
of Dwarves.

1352
01:34:25,081 --> 01:34:28,208
Your pride will be your downfall.

1353
01:34:28,209 --> 01:34:31,294
You stand in the presence
of one of the few in Middle-earth...

1354
01:34:31,295 --> 01:34:36,295
...who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond.

1355
01:34:42,056 --> 01:34:47,056
Thorin, no.

1356
01:34:53,192 --> 01:34:56,236
Erebor.

1357
01:34:56,237 --> 01:34:58,196
What is your interest...

1358
01:34:58,197 --> 01:35:01,324
...in this map?

1359
01:35:01,325 --> 01:35:03,201
It's mainly academic.

1360
01:35:03,202 --> 01:35:04,160
As you know...

1361
01:35:04,161 --> 01:35:09,161
...this sort of artifact
sometimes contains hidden text.

1362
01:35:13,587 --> 01:35:18,587
You still read ancient Dwarvish,
do you not?

1363
01:35:22,096 --> 01:35:24,389
<font color=#008000>Ah, cirth ithil.</font>

1364
01:35:24,390 --> 01:35:27,017
Moon runes?

1365
01:35:27,018 --> 01:35:29,644
Of course.

1366
01:35:29,645 --> 01:35:31,604
An easy thing to miss.

1367
01:35:31,605 --> 01:35:33,398
Well, in this case, that is true.

1368
01:35:33,399 --> 01:35:36,067
Moon runes can only be read
by the light of a moon...

1369
01:35:36,068 --> 01:35:38,403
...of the same shape and season...

1370
01:35:38,404 --> 01:35:41,239
...as the day on which they were written.

1371
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:46,240
Can you read them?

1372
01:35:47,621 --> 01:35:50,874
These runes were written
on a Midsummer's Eve...

1373
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:55,754
...by the light of a crescent moon
nearly 200 years ago.

1374
01:35:55,755 --> 01:35:59,466
It would seem you were meant
to come to Rivendell.

1375
01:35:59,467 --> 01:36:00,925
Fate is with you...

1376
01:36:00,926 --> 01:36:02,886
...Thorin Oakenshield. The same moon...

1377
01:36:02,887 --> 01:36:07,887
...shines upon us tonight.

1378
01:36:24,283 --> 01:36:25,450
"Stand by the...

1379
01:36:25,451 --> 01:36:29,037
...gray stone when the thrush knocks...

1380
01:36:29,038 --> 01:36:34,038
...and the setting sun with
the last light of Durin's Day...

1381
01:36:34,043 --> 01:36:38,588
- ...will shine upon the keyhole."
- Durin's Day?

1382
01:36:38,589 --> 01:36:42,217
It is the start of the Dwarves' new year,
when the last moon of autumn...

1383
01:36:42,218 --> 01:36:45,261
...and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together.

1384
01:36:45,262 --> 01:36:47,347
This is ill news.

1385
01:36:47,348 --> 01:36:50,058
Summer is passing.
Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

1386
01:36:50,059 --> 01:36:51,518
We still have time.

1387
01:36:51,519 --> 01:36:54,145
- Time? For what?
- To find the entrance.

1388
01:36:54,146 --> 01:36:58,108
We have to be standing in exactly
the right spot at exactly the right time.

1389
01:36:58,109 --> 01:37:02,070
Then, and only then,
can the door be opened.

1390
01:37:02,071 --> 01:37:02,987
So this is...

1391
01:37:02,988 --> 01:37:06,491
...your purpose, to enter the mountain?

1392
01:37:06,492 --> 01:37:08,034
What of it?

1393
01:37:08,035 --> 01:37:12,580
There are some who would not deem it wise.

1394
01:37:12,581 --> 01:37:15,166
What do you mean?

1395
01:37:15,167 --> 01:37:20,167
You are not the only guardian
to stand watch over Middle-earth.

1406
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:19,684
Not with your...

1407
01:40:19,685 --> 01:40:21,686
...companions?

1408
01:40:21,687 --> 01:40:26,687
Uh, no, I shan't be missed.

1409
01:40:28,110 --> 01:40:33,072
The truth is that most of them
don't think I should be on this journey.

1410
01:40:33,073 --> 01:40:35,783
Indeed?

1411
01:40:35,784 --> 01:40:39,078
I've heard that Hobbits are very resilient.

1412
01:40:42,374 --> 01:40:44,000
Really?

1413
01:40:44,001 --> 01:40:49,001
Mm.

1414
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:54,590
I've also heard they're fond
of the comforts of home.

1415
01:40:57,473 --> 01:41:00,433
I've heard that it's unwise
to seek the council of Elves.

1416
01:41:00,434 --> 01:41:05,434
That they will answer with yes and no.

1417
01:41:12,154 --> 01:41:14,947
You are very welcome to stay here,
if that...

1418
01:41:14,948 --> 01:41:19,948
...is your wish.

1419

1422
01:41:47,606 --> 01:41:50,817
No, you did the same thing.
It's not like you didn't do it.

1423
01:41:50,818 --> 01:41:55,818
Dori! Here, take that.

1424
01:41:59,118 --> 01:42:03,287
Bombur!

1425
01:42:18,053 --> 01:42:20,054
Of course I was going to tell you.
I was waiting...

1426
01:42:20,055 --> 01:42:25,055
...for this very chance. And really, I think
you can trust that I know what I am doing.

1427
01:42:25,102 --> 01:42:27,854
Do you? That dragon has slept...

1428
01:42:27,855 --> 01:42:29,647
...for 60 years.

1429
01:42:29,648 --> 01:42:31,899
What will happen if your plan should fail...

1430
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:34,861
- ...if you wake that beast?
- What if we succeed?

1431
01:42:34,862 --> 01:42:37,196
If the Dwarves take back the mountain...

1432
01:42:37,197 --> 01:42:39,073
...our defenses in the east
will be strengthened.

1433
01:42:39,074 --> 01:42:41,659
It is a dangerous move, Gandalf.

1434
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:43,703
It is also dangerous to do nothing.

1435
01:42:43,704 --> 01:42:48,207
Oh, come, the throne of Erebor
is Thorin's birthright. What is it you fear?

1436
01:42:48,208 --> 01:42:50,084
Have you forgotten?

1437
01:42:50,085 --> 01:42:53,880
A strain of madness
runs deep in that family.

1438
01:42:53,881 --> 01:42:56,799
His grandfather lost his mind.
His father succumbed to...

1439
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,551
...the same sickness.

1440
01:42:58,552 --> 01:43:01,304
Can you swear Thorin Oakenshield...

1441
01:43:01,305 --> 01:43:05,516
...will not also fall?

1442
01:43:05,517 --> 01:43:10,021
Gandalf, these decisions
do not rest with us alone. It is not...

1443
01:43:10,022 --> 01:43:14,650
...up to you or me to redraw
the map of Middle-earth.

1444
01:43:14,651 --> 01:43:18,696
With or without our help, these Dwarves
will march on the mountain.

1445
01:43:18,697 --> 01:43:21,782
They're determined to reclaim
their homeland.

1446
01:43:21,783 --> 01:43:26,783
I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield
feels that he is answerable to anyone.

1447
01:43:27,122 --> 01:43:28,998
Nor, for that matter, am I.

1448
01:43:28,999 --> 01:43:33,999
It is not me you must answer to.

1449
01:43:44,223 --> 01:43:46,807
Lady Galadriel.

1450
01:43:46,808 --> 01:43:48,600
Mithrandir.

1451

1453
01:44:07,955 --> 01:44:11,332
I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.

1454
01:44:11,333 --> 01:44:13,292
He didn't.

1455
01:44:13,293 --> 01:44:18,293
I did.

1456
01:44:20,425 --> 01:44:23,219
Ah.

1457
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:25,137
Saruman.

1458
01:44:25,138 --> 01:44:29,809
You've been busy of late, my friend.

1459
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:32,353
Tell me, Gandalf...

1460
01:44:32,354 --> 01:44:36,065
...did you think these plans
and schemes of yours...

1461
01:44:36,066 --> 01:44:38,150
...would go unnoticed?

1462
01:44:38,151 --> 01:44:40,820
Unnoticed?

1463
01:44:40,821 --> 01:44:42,405
No.

1464
01:44:42,406 --> 01:44:44,949
I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.

1465
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:48,953
The dragon has long been on your mind.

1466
01:44:48,954 --> 01:44:51,163
That is true, my lady.

1467
01:44:51,164 --> 01:44:53,708
Smaug owes allegiance to no one.

1468
01:44:53,709 --> 01:44:56,711
But if he should side with the enemy...

1469
01:44:56,712 --> 01:44:59,797
...a dragon could be used
to terrible effect.

1470
01:44:59,798 --> 01:45:02,049
What enemy?

1471
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:05,094
Gandalf, the enemy is defeated.

1472
01:45:05,095 --> 01:45:10,095
Sauron is vanquished.
He can never regain his full strength.

1473
01:45:11,893 --> 01:45:15,646
Does it not worry you
that the last of the Dwarf rings...

1474
01:45:15,647 --> 01:45:17,732
...should simply vanish...

1475
01:45:17,733 --> 01:45:19,984
...along with its bearer?

1476
01:45:19,985 --> 01:45:23,946
Of the seven Dwarf rings,
four were consumed by dragons...

1477
01:45:23,947 --> 01:45:27,408
...two were taken by Sauron
before he fell in Mordor.

1478
01:45:27,409 --> 01:45:32,409
The fate of the last Dwarf ring
remains unknown.

1479
01:45:34,374 --> 01:45:37,335
The ring that was worn by Thrain.

1480
01:45:37,336 --> 01:45:39,545
Without the ruling Ring of Power...

1481
01:45:39,546 --> 01:45:44,383
...the seven are of no value to the enemy.

1482
01:45:44,384 --> 01:45:45,301
To control...

1483
01:45:45,302 --> 01:45:46,677
...the other rings...

1484
01:45:46,678 --> 01:45:50,598
...he needs the One.

1485
01:45:50,599 --> 01:45:53,392
And that ring was lost long, long ago.

1486
01:45:53,393 --> 01:45:54,602
It was swept out...

1487
01:45:54,603 --> 01:45:57,313
...to sea by the waters of the Anduin.

1488
01:45:57,314 --> 01:46:02,314
Gandalf, for 400 years
we have lived in peace...

1489
01:46:02,653 --> 01:46:04,403
...a hard-won...

1490
01:46:04,404 --> 01:46:05,905
...watchful peace.

1491
01:46:05,906 --> 01:46:09,992
Are we? Are we at peace?

1492
01:46:09,993 --> 01:46:14,993
Trolls have come down from the mountains.
They are raiding villages, destroying farms.

1493
01:46:15,165 --> 01:46:17,625
Orcs have attacked us on the road.

1494
01:46:17,626 --> 01:46:19,627
Hardly a prelude to war.

1495
01:46:19,628 --> 01:46:22,046
Always you must meddle...

1496
01:46:22,047 --> 01:46:24,215
...looking for trouble where none exists.

1497
01:46:24,216 --> 01:46:27,468
Let him speak.

1498
01:46:27,469 --> 01:46:32,469
There is something at work
beyond the evil of Smaug.

1499
01:46:32,641 --> 01:46:35,851
Something far more powerful.

1500
01:46:35,852 --> 01:46:40,852
We can remain blind to it, but it will not
be ignoring us, that I can promise you.

1501
01:46:41,441 --> 01:46:44,443
A sickness lies over the Greenwood.

1502
01:46:44,444 --> 01:46:47,446
The woodsmen who live there now
call it Mirkwood.

1503
01:46:47,447 --> 01:46:51,117
And they say...

1504
01:46:51,118 --> 01:46:52,034
Well?

1505
01:46:52,035 --> 01:46:54,078
Don't stop now.

1506
01:46:54,079 --> 01:46:56,580
Tell us what the woodsmen say.

1507
01:46:56,581 --> 01:46:59,083
They speak of a Necromancer...

1508
01:46:59,084 --> 01:47:00,459
...living in Dol Guldur.

1509
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:03,671
A sorcerer who can summon the dead.

1510
01:47:03,672 --> 01:47:05,256
That's absurd.

1511
01:47:05,257 --> 01:47:08,259
No such power exists in this world.

1512
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:12,638
This Necromancer is nothing more
than a mortal man.

1513
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:15,349
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

1514
01:47:15,350 --> 01:47:17,101
And so I thought too.

1515
01:47:17,102 --> 01:47:20,813
- But Radagast has seen...
- Radagast?

1516
01:47:20,814 --> 01:47:24,316
Do not speak to me
of Radagast the Brown.

1517
01:47:24,317 --> 01:47:26,318
He's a foolish fellow.

1518
01:47:26,319 --> 01:47:30,698
Well, he's odd, I grant you.
He lives a solitary life.

1519
01:47:30,699 --> 01:47:33,159
It's not that. It's his excessive...

1520
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:35,578
...consumption of mushrooms.

1521
01:47:35,579 --> 01:47:37,204
They've addled his brain...

1522
01:47:37,205 --> 01:47:40,040
...and yellowed his teeth.

1523
01:47:40,041 --> 01:47:41,667
I've warned him.

1524
01:47:41,668 --> 01:47:45,087
It is unbefitting one of the Istari
to be wandering the woods...

1525
01:47:45,088 --> 01:47:48,883
<i>You carry something.

1526
01:47:48,884 --> 01:47:52,052
<i>It came to you from Radagast.

1527
01:47:52,053 --> 01:47:55,681
<i>He found it in Dol Guldur.

1528
01:47:55,682 --> 01:47:58,559
Yes.

1529
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:02,146
Show me.

1530
01:48:02,147 --> 01:48:03,522
...listen to me.

1531
01:48:03,523 --> 01:48:07,526
I would think I was talking to myself
for all the attention that he paid.

1532
01:48:07,527 --> 01:48:10,404
By all means...

1533
01:48:10,405 --> 01:48:13,657
What is that?

1534
01:48:13,658 --> 01:48:18,658
A relic of Mordor.

1535
01:48:26,838 --> 01:48:29,006
A Morgul Blade.

1536
01:48:29,007 --> 01:48:32,343
Made for the Witchking of Angmar.

1537
01:48:32,344 --> 01:48:37,344
And buried with him.

1538
01:48:37,599 --> 01:48:39,850
When Angmar fell...

1539
01:48:39,851 --> 01:48:42,645
...the Men of the North took his body...

1540
01:48:42,646 --> 01:48:46,857
...and all that he possessed and sealed it
within the High Fells of Rhudaur.

1541
01:48:46,858 --> 01:48:50,569
Deep within the rock they buried him...

1542
01:48:50,570 --> 01:48:53,948
...in a tomb so dark...

1543
01:48:53,949 --> 01:48:55,741
...it would never come to light.

1544
01:48:55,742 --> 01:48:58,828
This is not possible.

1545
01:48:58,829 --> 01:49:01,789
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs.

1546
01:49:01,790 --> 01:49:03,833
They cannot be opened.

1547
01:49:03,834 --> 01:49:08,834
What proof do we have this weapon
came from Angmar's grave?

1548
01:49:09,297 --> 01:49:10,548
I have none.

1549
01:49:10,549 --> 01:49:13,384
Because there is none.

1550
01:49:13,385 --> 01:49:15,970
Let us examine what we know.

1551
01:49:15,971 --> 01:49:18,389
A single Orc pack...

1552
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:21,350
...has dared to cross the Bruinen.

1553
01:49:21,351 --> 01:49:24,728
A dagger from a bygone age
has been found.

1554
01:49:24,729 --> 01:49:29,729
And a human sorcerer who calls himself
"The Necromancer"...

1555
01:49:30,318 --> 01:49:35,030
...has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress.

1556
01:49:35,031 --> 01:49:39,201
It's not so very much after all.

1557
01:49:39,202 --> 01:49:42,538
The question of this Dwarvish company,
however...

1558
01:49:42,539 --> 01:49:44,415
...troubles me deeply.

1559
01:49:44,416 --> 01:49:46,292
I'm not convinced, Gandalf.

1560
01:49:46,293 --> 01:49:50,170
I do not feel I can condone such a quest.

1561
01:49:50,171 --> 01:49:54,550
If they'd come to me, I might have
spared them this disappointment.

1562
01:49:54,551 --> 01:49:57,845
I do not pretend to understand your reason
for raising their hopes.

1563
01:49:57,846 --> 01:50:02,099
<i>They are leaving.

1564
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:05,603
Yes.

1565
01:50:05,604 --> 01:50:07,646
You knew.

1566
01:50:10,984 --> 01:50:13,193
No, I'm afraid there is...

1567
01:50:13,194 --> 01:50:17,281
...nothing else for it.

1568
01:50:17,282 --> 01:50:19,199
My Lord Elrond.

1569
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:24,200
The Dwarves, they're gone.

1570
01:50:27,459 --> 01:50:29,585
Be on your guard.

1571
01:50:29,586 --> 01:50:32,463
We're about to step over
the Edge of the Wild.

1572
01:50:32,464 --> 01:50:34,965
Balin, you know these paths. Lead on.

1573
01:50:34,966 --> 01:50:39,966
Aye.

1574
01:50:42,098 --> 01:50:44,141
Master Baggins...

1575
01:50:44,142 --> 01:50:49,142
...I suggest you keep up.

1576
01:51:00,033 --> 01:51:01,867
You will follow them.

1577
01:51:01,868 --> 01:51:03,202
Yes.

1578
01:51:03,203 --> 01:51:06,497
You are right to help Thorin Oakenshield.

1579
01:51:06,498 --> 01:51:09,917
But I fear this quest has set in motion...

1580
01:51:09,918 --> 01:51:13,629
...forces we do not yet understand.

1581
01:51:13,630 --> 01:51:17,716
The riddle of the Morgul Blade
must be answered.

1582
01:51:17,717 --> 01:51:21,428
Something moves in the shadows unseen,
hidden from our sight.

1583
01:51:21,429 --> 01:51:23,639
It will not show itself.

1584
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:25,599
Not yet.

1585
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:28,602
But every day it grows in strength.

1586
01:51:28,603 --> 01:51:33,603
You must be careful.

1587
01:51:35,026 --> 01:51:38,445
Mithrandir?

1588
01:51:38,446 --> 01:51:42,449
Why the Halfling?

1589
01:51:42,450 --> 01:51:46,996
I do not know.

1590
01:51:46,997 --> 01:51:51,000
Saruman believes
that it is only great power...

1591
01:51:51,001 --> 01:51:54,336
...that can hold evil in check.

1592
01:51:54,337 --> 01:51:57,965
But that is not what I have found.

1593
01:51:57,966 --> 01:52:01,885
I have found it is the small things...

1594
01:52:01,886 --> 01:52:04,430
...everyday deeds of ordinary folk...

1595
01:52:04,431 --> 01:52:08,100
...that keeps the darkness at bay.

1596
01:52:08,101 --> 01:52:13,101
Simple acts of kindness and love.

1597
01:52:13,481 --> 01:52:18,481
Why Bilbo Baggins?

1598
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:23,198
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid...

1599
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:28,199
...and he gives me courage.

1600
01:52:30,415 --> 01:52:35,415
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.

1601
01:52:35,545 --> 01:52:40,545
You are not alone.

1602
01:52:40,842 --> 01:52:45,842
{\an8}<font color=#008000>Ae boe i le eliathon, im tulithon.
<font color=#FFFF00>(If it will be necessary to help you, I will come.)</font>

1603
01:54:17,188 --> 01:54:22,188
Hey! Hold on!

1604
01:54:26,114 --> 01:54:27,197
Aah!

1605
01:54:27,198 --> 01:54:28,490
Bilbo!

1606
01:54:30,827 --> 01:54:31,994
We must find...

1607
01:54:31,995 --> 01:54:34,037
...shelter!

1608
01:54:34,038 --> 01:54:39,038
Look out!

1609
01:54:41,838 --> 01:54:44,006
Look out, brother!

1610
01:54:44,007 --> 01:54:48,927
Hold on!

1611
01:54:48,928 --> 01:54:51,054
This is no thunderstorm.

1612
01:54:51,055 --> 01:54:54,391
It's a thunder-battle!

1613
01:54:54,392 --> 01:54:59,392
Look!

1614
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:02,649
Well, bless me.

1615
01:55:02,650 --> 01:55:04,610
The legends are true.

1616
01:55:04,611 --> 01:55:09,611
Giants! Stone-Giants!

1617
01:55:15,663 --> 01:55:18,582
Take cover, you fool!

1618
01:55:18,583 --> 01:55:23,583
Hold on!

1619
01:55:28,593 --> 01:55:29,843
What's happening?

1620
01:55:29,844 --> 01:55:34,844
Grab my hand!

1621
01:55:54,953 --> 01:55:56,161
Go, go, go!

1622
01:55:56,162 --> 01:55:57,079
Run! Get off!

1623
01:55:57,080 --> 01:56:02,080
Get off!

1624
01:56:02,252 --> 01:56:07,252
- Run!
- Hold on!

1625
01:56:09,842 --> 01:56:14,842
Look out!

1626
01:56:31,698 --> 01:56:33,490
Jump!

1627
01:56:33,491 --> 01:56:38,491
Come on!

1628
01:56:38,663 --> 01:56:43,663
Hold on!

1629
01:56:48,172 --> 01:56:50,549
No!

1630
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:55,550
No!

1631
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:01,727
No!

1632
01:57:01,728 --> 01:57:06,728
Kili!

1633
01:57:09,193 --> 01:57:13,155
It's all right! They're alive!

1634
01:57:13,156 --> 01:57:14,448
Where's Bilbo?

1635
01:57:14,449 --> 01:57:15,699
Where's the Hobbit?

1636
01:57:17,035 --> 01:57:21,288
There!

1637
01:57:21,289 --> 01:57:23,540
Get him!

1638
01:57:23,541 --> 01:57:24,791
Aah!

1639
01:57:24,792 --> 01:57:25,709
Grab my hand!

1640
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:28,420
Bilbo!

1641
01:57:28,421 --> 01:57:29,713
Ori, be careful!

1642
01:57:29,714 --> 01:57:31,089
Take it!

1643
01:57:31,090 --> 01:57:32,507
I've got you, lad.

1644
01:57:32,508 --> 01:57:37,508
Grab on! Grab on!

1645
01:57:43,728 --> 01:57:45,437
Come on.

1646
01:57:45,438 --> 01:57:46,730
Get him.

1647
01:57:46,731 --> 01:57:51,568
Come on, lad. Up you get.

1648
01:57:51,569 --> 01:57:54,488
I thought we'd lost our burglar.

1649
01:57:54,489 --> 01:57:57,866
He's been lost ever since he left home.

1650
01:57:57,867 --> 01:57:59,951
He should never have come.

1651
01:57:59,952 --> 01:58:03,747
He has no place amongst us.

1652
01:58:03,748 --> 01:58:08,748
Dwalin!

1653
01:58:11,464 --> 01:58:12,756
It looks safe enough.

1654
01:58:12,757 --> 01:58:14,466
Search to the back.

1655
01:58:14,467 --> 01:58:19,467
Caves in the mountain
are seldom unoccupied.

1656
01:58:20,765 --> 01:58:24,601
There's nothing here.

1657
01:58:24,602 --> 01:58:26,895
Right, then. Let's get a fire started.

1658
01:58:26,896 --> 01:58:29,981
No. No fires. Not in this place.

1659
01:58:29,982 --> 01:58:31,858
Get some sleep.

1660
01:58:31,859 --> 01:58:34,528
We start at first light.

1661
01:58:34,529 --> 01:58:38,407
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us.

1662
01:58:38,408 --> 01:58:39,950
That was the plan.

1663
01:58:39,951 --> 01:58:41,535
Plans change.

1664
01:58:41,536 --> 01:58:45,747
Bofur, take the first watch.

1665
01:58:52,338 --> 01:58:54,000
{\an8}<font color=#FF0000>Nuzdun gin nash.</font>

1667
01:59:59,030 --> 01:59:59,946
Where do you think...

1668
01:59:59,947 --> 02:00:04,242
...You're going?

1669
02:00:04,243 --> 02:00:06,703
Back to Rivendell.

1670
02:00:06,704 --> 02:00:09,206
No, no, you can't turn back now, eh?

1671
02:00:09,207 --> 02:00:10,707
You're part of the company.

1672
02:00:10,708 --> 02:00:12,334
You're one of us.

1673
02:00:12,335 --> 02:00:15,462
I'm not, though, am I?

1674
02:00:15,463 --> 02:00:18,965
Thorin said I should never have come
and he was right.

1675
02:00:18,966 --> 02:00:20,008
I'm not a Took...

1676
02:00:20,009 --> 02:00:24,346
...I'm a Baggins.
I don't know what I was thinking.

1677
02:00:24,347 --> 02:00:26,264
I should never have run out my door.

1678
02:00:26,265 --> 02:00:28,683
You're homesick. I understand.

1679
02:00:28,684 --> 02:00:31,353
No, you don't. You don't understand.
None of you do.

1680
02:00:31,354 --> 02:00:34,231
You're Dwarves.
You're used to this life.

1681
02:00:34,232 --> 02:00:35,690
To living on the road...

1682
02:00:35,691 --> 02:00:40,691
...never settling in one place,
not belonging anywhere!

1683
02:00:42,114 --> 02:00:43,823
Oh, I am sorry. I didn't...

1684
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:54,330
No, you're right.

1685
02:00:54,335 --> 02:00:59,335
We don't belong anywhere.

1686
02:01:04,554 --> 02:01:09,554
I wish you all the luck in the world.

1687
02:01:10,059 --> 02:01:15,059
I really do.

1688
02:01:15,898 --> 02:01:19,526
What's that?

1689
02:01:19,527 --> 02:01:24,527
Hmm?

1690
02:01:39,755 --> 02:01:41,047
Wake up!

1691
02:01:41,048 --> 02:01:42,090
Wake up!

1692
02:01:42,091 --> 02:01:43,341
Whoa!

1693
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:10,619
Look out! Look out!

1694
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:11,536
Get away!

1695
02:02:16,334 --> 02:02:18,001
Filthy scum!

1696
02:02:18,002 --> 02:02:23,002
Get back!

1697
02:02:23,966 --> 02:02:28,966
You'll pay for this!

1698
02:02:32,224 --> 02:02:35,060
Got you.

1699
02:02:35,061 --> 02:02:38,813
All right, all right.

1700
02:02:38,814 --> 02:02:43,814
Get off! Get your hands off me!
Get off me!

1701
02:02:47,198 --> 02:02:52,198
Get off me!

1702
02:04:29,508 --> 02:04:34,012
I feel a song coming on.

1703
02:04:36,307 --> 02:04:38,933
<i>Clap, snap
The black crack

1704
02:04:38,934 --> 02:04:41,603
<i>Grip, grab
Pinch and nab

<i>Make 'em stammer and

1707
02:04:46,233 --> 02:04:48,985
<i>Squeak

1708
02:04:48,986 --> 02:04:53,072
<i>Pound, pound
Far

1709
02:04:53,073 --> 02:04:58,073
<i>Underground

1710
02:04:59,955 --> 02:05:02,957
<i>Down, down, down in Goblin-town

1711
02:05:02,958 --> 02:05:05,043
<i>Down, down, down in Goblin-town

1712
02:05:05,044 --> 02:05:08,379
<i>With a swish and a smack
And a whip and a crack

1713
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:11,341
<i>Everybody talks
When they're on my rack

1714
02:05:11,342 --> 02:05:14,886
<i>Pound, pound

1715
02:05:14,887 --> 02:05:17,889
<i>Down, down, down to Goblin-town

1716
02:05:17,890 --> 02:05:20,767
<i>Down, down, down to Goblin-town

1717
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:23,645
<i>Hammer and tongs
Get out your knockers and gongs

1718
02:05:23,646 --> 02:05:28,646
<i>You won't last long
On the end of my prong

1719
02:05:29,568 --> 02:05:31,444
<i>Clash, crash

1720
02:05:31,445 --> 02:05:32,946
<i>Crush and smash

1721
02:05:32,947 --> 02:05:35,490
<i>Bang, break
Shiver and shake

1722
02:05:35,491 --> 02:05:40,203
<i>You can yammer and yelp
But there ain't no help

1723
02:05:40,204 --> 02:05:45,204
<i>Pound, pound

1724
02:05:45,709 --> 02:05:49,254
<i>Down, down, down in Goblin

Yeah!

1727
02:06:08,607 --> 02:06:10,692
Catchy, isn't it?

1728
02:06:10,693 --> 02:06:14,529
It's one of my own compositions.

1729
02:06:14,530 --> 02:06:16,155
That's not a song.

1730
02:06:16,156 --> 02:06:18,074
It's an abomination!

1731
02:06:18,075 --> 02:06:19,284
Abomination.

1732
02:06:19,285 --> 02:06:21,995
Mutations. Deviations.

1733
02:06:21,996 --> 02:06:26,996
That's all you're gonna find down here.

1734
02:06:28,794 --> 02:06:33,794
Who would be so bold
as to come armed into my kingdom?

1735
02:06:34,425 --> 02:06:35,592
Spies?

1736
02:06:35,593 --> 02:06:36,759
Thieves?

1737
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:38,094
Assassins?

1738
02:06:38,095 --> 02:06:39,971
Dwarves, Your Malevolence.

1739
02:06:39,972 --> 02:06:41,890
Dwarves?

1740
02:06:41,891 --> 02:06:43,808
We found them on the Front Porch.

1741
02:06:43,809 --> 02:06:48,313
Well, don't just stand there. Search them.

1742
02:06:48,314 --> 02:06:49,689
Every crack.

1743
02:06:49,690 --> 02:06:54,690
Every crevice.

1744
02:06:57,573 --> 02:06:58,740
It is my belief...

1745
02:06:58,741 --> 02:07:01,284
...your great protuberance, that they...

1746
02:07:01,285 --> 02:07:03,244
...are in league with Elves!

1747
02:07:03,245 --> 02:07:07,290
"Made in Rivendell." Ah.

1748
02:07:07,291 --> 02:07:12,291
Second Age. Couldn't give it away.

1749
02:07:13,422 --> 02:07:15,882
Just a couple of keepsakes.

1750
02:07:15,883 --> 02:07:19,510
What are you doing in these parts?

1751
02:07:19,511 --> 02:07:23,389
Uh, don't worry, lads. I'll handle this.

1752
02:07:23,390 --> 02:07:24,933
What's...? What's that?

1753
02:07:24,934 --> 02:07:29,934
No tricks. I want the truth, warts and all.

1754
02:07:29,939 --> 02:07:32,774
You're going to have to speak up.

1755
02:07:32,775 --> 02:07:35,443
Your boys flattened my trumpet.

1756
02:07:35,444 --> 02:07:39,405
I'll flatten more than your trumpet!

1757
02:07:39,406 --> 02:07:43,952
If it's more information you want,
I'm the one you should speak to.

1758
02:07:43,953 --> 02:07:47,705
Mm-hm.

1759
02:07:47,706 --> 02:07:51,709
We were on the road.
Well, it's not so much a road as a path.

1760
02:07:51,710 --> 02:07:54,504
It's not even that, come to think of it.
More like a track.

1761
02:07:54,505 --> 02:07:58,174
Anyway, the point is, we were on this road,
like a path, like a track.

1762
02:07:58,175 --> 02:08:01,803
And then we weren't, which is a problem,
because we were...

1763
02:08:01,804 --> 02:08:03,137
- ...supposed to be in Dunland...
- Shut up.

1764
02:08:03,138 --> 02:08:04,555
...last Tuesday.

1765
02:08:04,556 --> 02:08:06,557
Visiting distant relations.

1766
02:08:06,558 --> 02:08:08,518
Some inbreds on me mother's side.

1767
02:08:08,519 --> 02:08:10,228
Shut up!

1768
02:08:13,357 --> 02:08:17,443
If they will not talk, we'll make them squawk.

1769
02:08:17,444 --> 02:08:19,195
Bring up the mangler.

1770
02:08:19,196 --> 02:08:22,156
Bring up the bonebreaker.

1771
02:08:22,157 --> 02:08:24,075
Start with the youngest.

1772
02:08:24,076 --> 02:08:27,787
Wait!

1773
02:08:27,788 --> 02:08:31,290
Well, well, well.

1774
02:08:31,291 --> 02:08:34,502
Look who it is.

1775
02:08:34,503 --> 02:08:38,715
Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror...

1776
02:08:38,716 --> 02:08:43,386
...King Under the Mountain.

1777
02:08:43,387 --> 02:08:46,931
Oh, but I'm forgetting.
You don't have a mountain.

1778
02:08:46,932 --> 02:08:48,725
And you're not a king...

1779
02:08:48,726 --> 02:08:51,102
...which makes you...

1780
02:08:51,103 --> 02:08:56,103
...nobody, really.

1781
02:08:56,442 --> 02:09:01,442
I know someone who would
pay a pretty price for your head.

1782
02:09:02,156 --> 02:09:04,282
Just a head.

1783
02:09:04,283 --> 02:09:07,744
Nothing attached.

1784
02:09:07,745 --> 02:09:11,080
Perhaps you know of whom I speak.

1785
02:09:11,081 --> 02:09:16,081
An old enemy of yours.

1786
02:09:16,128 --> 02:09:21,128
A pale Orc, astride a white Warg.

1787
02:09:22,217 --> 02:09:27,217
Azog the Defiler was destroyed.

1788
02:09:27,806 --> 02:09:30,391
He was slain in battle long ago.

1789
02:09:30,392 --> 02:09:34,353
So you think his defiling days are done,
do you?

1790
02:09:36,231 --> 02:09:38,900
Send word to the pale Orc.

1791
02:09:38,901 --> 02:09:43,279
Tell him I have found his prize.

1792
02:10:19,399 --> 02:10:22,235
Yes.

1793
02:10:22,236 --> 02:10:24,779
Yes.

1794
02:10:24,780 --> 02:10:28,658
Yes.

1795
02:10:28,659 --> 02:10:31,994
Yes!

1796
02:10:31,995 --> 02:10:36,995
Gollum, gollum!

1797
02:10:57,688 --> 02:11:01,858
Aah!

1798
02:11:01,859 --> 02:11:06,696
Nasty Goblinses!

1799
02:11:06,697 --> 02:11:08,614
Better than old bones, precious.

1800
02:11:08,615 --> 02:11:13,615
Better than nothing.

1801
02:11:38,937 --> 02:11:43,858
Too many boneses, precious.
Not enough flesh!

1802
02:11:43,859 --> 02:11:48,237
Shut up! Cut its skin off.

1803
02:11:48,238 --> 02:11:50,907
Start with its head.

1804
02:11:55,579 --> 02:11:59,540
<i>The cold hard lands
They bites our hands

1805
02:11:59,541 --> 02:12:03,044

1806
02:12:03,045 --> 02:12:07,715
<i>The rocks and stones
They're like old bones

1807
02:12:07,716 --> 02:12:10,134
<i>All bare of meat

1808
02:12:10,135 --> 02:12:13,930
<i>Cold as death

1809
02:12:13,931 --> 02:12:15,681
<i>It's good to eat

1810
02:12:54,263 --> 02:12:56,806
Bless us and splash us...

1811
02:12:56,807 --> 02:12:58,683
...precious.

1812
02:12:58,684 --> 02:13:02,436
That's a meaty mouthful.

1813
02:13:02,437 --> 02:13:06,399
Gollum, gollum! Aah.

1814
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:08,943
Back. Stay back.

1815
02:13:08,944 --> 02:13:10,903
I'm warning you...

1816
02:13:10,904 --> 02:13:14,240
...don't come any closer.

1817
02:13:14,241 --> 02:13:16,575
It's got an Elfish blade.

1818
02:13:16,576 --> 02:13:20,204
But it's not an Elfs.

1819
02:13:20,205 --> 02:13:22,581
Not an Elfs, no.

1820
02:13:22,582 --> 02:13:25,418
What is it, precious?

1821
02:13:25,419 --> 02:13:27,044
What is it?

1822
02:13:27,045 --> 02:13:31,424
My name is Bilbo Baggins.

1823
02:13:31,425 --> 02:13:34,051
Bagginses?

1824
02:13:34,052 --> 02:13:38,055
What is a Bagginses, precious?

1825
02:13:38,056 --> 02:13:42,268
- I'm a Hobbit from the Shire.
- Oh.

1826
02:13:42,269 --> 02:13:47,269
We like Goblinses, batses and fishes.
But we hasn't tried Hobbitses before.

1827
02:13:48,817 --> 02:13:51,986
Is it soft? Is it juicy?

1828
02:13:51,987 --> 02:13:53,362
Now, now...

1829
02:13:53,363 --> 02:13:55,740
...keep your distance!

1830
02:13:55,741 --> 02:13:57,867
I'll use this if I have to.

1831
02:13:57,868 --> 02:13:58,993
Aah!

1832
02:13:58,994 --> 02:14:00,369
I don't want any trouble.

1833
02:14:00,370 --> 02:14:02,038
Do you understand?

1834
02:14:02,039 --> 02:14:05,291
Just show me the way to get out of here
and I'll be on my way.

1835
02:14:05,292 --> 02:14:07,376
Why? Is it lost?

1836
02:14:07,377 --> 02:14:11,380
Yes. Yes, and I want to get unlost
as soon as possible.

1837
02:14:11,381 --> 02:14:15,134
Ooh, we knows!
We knows safe paths for Hobbitses.

1838
02:14:15,135 --> 02:14:16,260
Safe paths in...

1839
02:14:16,261 --> 02:14:17,928
...the dark. Shut up!

1840
02:14:17,929 --> 02:14:19,180
I didn't say anything.

1841
02:14:19,181 --> 02:14:21,390
We wasn't talking to you.

1842
02:14:21,391 --> 02:14:24,477
Oh, yes, we was, precious. We was.

1843
02:14:24,478 --> 02:14:26,937
Look, I don't know what your game is...

1844
02:14:26,938 --> 02:14:27,855
...but I...

1845
02:14:27,856 --> 02:14:29,565
Games?

1846
02:14:29,566 --> 02:14:32,568
Oh, we love games,
doesn't we, precious?

1847
02:14:32,569 --> 02:14:35,029
Does it like games? Does it, does it?

1848
02:14:35,030 --> 02:14:37,615
Does it like to play?

1849
02:14:37,616 --> 02:14:41,160
Maybe.

1850

02:14:56,009 --> 02:14:57,843
Yes, yes.

1857
02:14:57,844 --> 02:15:01,222
Oh, let's have another one, eh?

1858
02:15:01,223 --> 02:15:03,224
Yes! Do it again.

1859
02:15:03,225 --> 02:15:04,809
Do it again. Ask us.

1860
02:15:04,810 --> 02:15:08,187
No! No more riddles.

1861
02:15:08,188 --> 02:15:10,314
Finish him off.

1862
02:15:10,315 --> 02:15:12,942
Finish him now! Gollum, gollum!

No! No. No.

1864
02:15:14,903 --> 02:15:18,155
No. I want to play. I do.

1865
02:15:18,156 --> 02:15:20,950
I want to play. I can see...

1866
02:15:20,951 --> 02:15:25,287
...you are very good at this.

1867
02:15:25,288 --> 02:15:28,958
So why don't we...

1868
02:15:28,959 --> 02:15:31,460
...have a game of riddles? Yes?

1869
02:15:31,461 --> 02:15:33,587
Just you and me.

1870
02:15:33,588 --> 02:15:37,967

Yes. Yes.

1872

And if I win...

1873
02:15:42,514 --> 02:15:45,683
...you show me the way out. Yes?

1874
02:15:45,684 --> 02:15:48,185
Yes. Yes.

1875
02:15:48,186 --> 02:15:49,603
And if it loses?

1876
02:15:49,604 --> 02:15:51,480
What then?

1877
02:15:51,481 --> 02:15:56,152
Well, if it loses, precious,
then we eats it.

1878
02:15:56,153 --> 02:16:01,153
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.

1879
02:16:06,329 --> 02:16:11,329
Fair enough.

1880
02:16:12,252 --> 02:16:17,252

1890
02:16:55,295 --> 02:16:58,422

02:18:54,331 --> 02:18:56,123
<i>Gnaws iron

1932
02:18:56,124 --> 02:18:58,709
<i>Bites steel

1933
02:18:58,710 --> 02:19:03,710
<i>Grinds hard stones to meal

1934
02:19:03,923 --> 02:19:05,799
Answer us.

1935
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:10,638
Give me a moment, please.
I gave you a good long while.

1936
02:19:10,639 --> 02:19:14,433
Birds, beasts... Beasts?
Trees, flowers.

1937
02:19:14,434 --> 02:19:16,018
I don't know this one.

1938
02:19:16,019 --> 02:19:19,396
Is it tasty?

1939
02:19:19,397 --> 02:19:23,942
Is it scrumptious?

1940
02:19:23,943 --> 02:19:25,778
Is it crunchable?

1941
02:19:25,779 --> 02:19:27,279
Let me think.

1942
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:32,280
Let me think.

1943
02:19:33,370 --> 02:19:36,372
It's stuck.

1944
02:19:36,373 --> 02:19:41,373
Bagginses is stuck.

1945
02:19:44,547 --> 02:19:49,547
Time's up.

1946
02:19:50,136 --> 02:19:51,970
Time.

1947
02:19:51,971 --> 02:19:53,389
The answer...

1948
02:19:53,390 --> 02:19:54,890
...is time.

1949
02:19:56,851 --> 02:20:00,688
Actually it wasn't that hard.

1950
02:20:00,689 --> 02:20:03,691
Last question.

1951
02:20:03,692 --> 02:20:05,651
Last chance.

1952
02:20:05,652 --> 02:20:09,863
Okay.

1953
02:20:09,864 --> 02:20:13,075
Ask us.

1954
02:20:13,076 --> 02:20:13,992
Ask us!

1955
02:20:13,993 --> 02:20:18,993
Yes, yes. All right.

1956
02:20:20,041 --> 02:20:22,501
What have I got...

1957
02:20:22,502 --> 02:20:27,256
...in my pocket?

1958
02:20:27,257 --> 02:20:30,008
That's no fair.

1959
02:20:30,009 --> 02:20:32,177
It's not fair! It's against...

1960
02:20:32,178 --> 02:20:35,097
...the rules!

1961
02:20:35,098 --> 02:20:36,932
Now ask us another one.

1962
02:20:36,933 --> 02:20:38,475
No. No, no, no.

1963
02:20:38,476 --> 02:20:42,604
You said ask me a question.
Well, that is my question.

1964
02:20:42,605 --> 02:20:45,107
What have I got in my pocket?

1965
02:20:46,443 --> 02:20:49,069
Three guesses, precious. It must give us...

1966
02:20:49,070 --> 02:20:50,154
...three!

1967
02:20:50,155 --> 02:20:52,614
Three guesses. Very well, guess away.

1968
02:20:52,615 --> 02:20:54,700
- Handses!
- Wrong.

1969
02:20:54,701 --> 02:20:55,909
Guess again.

1970
02:20:57,162 --> 02:21:01,415
Fishbones, Goblins' teeth,
wet shells, bats' wings...

1971
02:21:03,793 --> 02:21:06,128
Knife! Oh, shut up!

1972
02:21:06,129 --> 02:21:08,088
Wrong again. Last guess.

1973
02:21:08,089 --> 02:21:09,923
String.

1974
02:21:09,924 --> 02:21:11,383
Or nothing.

1975
02:21:11,384 --> 02:21:16,263
Two guesses at once.
Wrong both times.

1976
02:21:18,391 --> 02:21:21,226
So...

1977
02:21:21,227 --> 02:21:23,061
Come, then. I won the game.

1978
02:21:23,062 --> 02:21:25,439
You promised to show me the way out.

1979
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:28,525
Did we say so, precious?

1980
02:21:28,526 --> 02:21:33,526
Did we say so?

1981
02:21:34,699 --> 02:21:39,699
What has it got in its pocketses?

1982
02:21:40,497 --> 02:21:42,790
That's no concern of yours.

1983
02:21:42,791 --> 02:21:45,042
You lost.

1984
02:21:45,043 --> 02:21:48,754
Lost?

1985
02:21:48,755 --> 02:21:51,799
Lost?

1986
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:56,800
Lost?

1987
02:22:00,350 --> 02:22:03,310
Where is it?

1988
02:22:03,311 --> 02:22:05,229
Where is it?!

1989
02:22:05,230 --> 02:22:06,855
No!

1990
02:22:08,566 --> 02:22:10,359
Where is it?!

1991
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:11,276
No!

1992
02:22:11,277 --> 02:22:14,446
No!

1993
02:22:14,447 --> 02:22:16,281
Lost!

1994
02:22:16,282 --> 02:22:18,951
Curse us and splash us!

1995
02:22:18,952 --> 02:22:20,953
My precious...

1996
02:22:20,954 --> 02:22:24,248
...is lost!

1997
02:22:24,249 --> 02:22:25,374
What have you lost?

1998
02:22:25,375 --> 02:22:28,919
Mustn't ask us! Not its business!

1999
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:31,713
No! Gollum!

2000
02:22:31,714 --> 02:22:34,508
Gollum!

2001
02:22:46,145 --> 02:22:49,898
What has it got...

2002
02:22:49,899 --> 02:22:52,776
...in its nasty...

2003
02:22:52,777 --> 02:22:57,777
...little pocketses?

2004
02:23:05,498 --> 02:23:09,459
He stole it.

2005
02:23:09,460 --> 02:23:13,171
He stole it!

2006
02:23:15,091 --> 02:23:20,091
He stole it!

2007
02:23:22,390 --> 02:23:24,266
<i>Bones will be shattered

2008
02:23:24,267 --> 02:23:25,767
<i>Necks will be wrung

2009
02:23:25,768 --> 02:23:27,102
<i>You'll be beaten

2010
02:23:27,103 --> 02:23:29,521
<i>And battered
From racks you'll be hung

2011
02:23:29,522 --> 02:23:31,440
<i>You will die down here

2012
02:23:31,441 --> 02:23:32,983
<i>And never be

2013
02:23:32,984 --> 02:23:33,901
<i>Found

2014
02:23:33,902 --> 02:23:35,652
<i>Down in the deep

2015
02:23:35,653 --> 02:23:40,653
<i>Of Goblin-town

2016
02:23:40,950 --> 02:23:42,910
I know that sword!

2017
02:23:42,911 --> 02:23:45,537
It is the Goblin-cleaver!

2018
02:23:45,538 --> 02:23:47,956
The Biter!

2019
02:23:47,957 --> 02:23:49,499
The blade that sliced...

2020
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:52,544
...a thousand necks! Slash them!

2021
02:23:52,545 --> 02:23:54,838
Beat them! Kill them!

2022
02:23:54,839 --> 02:23:56,715
Kill them all!

2023
02:23:56,716 --> 02:24:01,716
Cut off his head!

2024
02:24:28,414 --> 02:24:31,291
Take up arms.

2025
02:24:31,292 --> 02:24:33,919
Fight.

2026
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:35,379
Fight!

2027
02:24:42,595 --> 02:24:45,597
He wields the Foehammer! The Beater!

2028
02:24:45,598 --> 02:24:50,598
Bright as daylight!

2029
02:24:56,818 --> 02:25:01,818
Thorin!

2030
02:25:11,541 --> 02:25:13,041
Follow me.

2031
02:25:13,042 --> 02:25:17,004
Quick!

2032
02:25:17,005 --> 02:25:22,005
Run!

2033
02:25:26,848 --> 02:25:31,848
Give it to us!

2034
02:25:48,286 --> 02:25:49,703
It's...

2035
02:25:49,704 --> 02:25:51,413
...ours!

2036
02:25:51,414 --> 02:25:56,414
It's ours!

2037
02:26:18,608 --> 02:26:22,235
Thief!

2038
02:26:22,236 --> 02:26:27,236
Baggins!

2039
02:26:31,537 --> 02:26:34,706
Quickly!

2040
02:26:34,707 --> 02:26:36,833
Faster!

2041
02:26:46,469 --> 02:26:50,430
Post!

2042
02:26:50,431 --> 02:26:55,431
Charge!

2043
02:27:38,437 --> 02:27:43,437
Cut the ropes!

2044
02:28:03,004 --> 02:28:04,421
Come on, quickly!

2045
02:28:04,422 --> 02:28:09,422
- Come on, move!
- Bombur!

2046
02:28:12,763 --> 02:28:17,763
Go, go, go!

2047
02:28:18,311 --> 02:28:23,311
Jump!

2048
02:28:25,484 --> 02:28:30,484
Jump, lad!

2049
02:28:47,298 --> 02:28:50,926
Come on!

2050
02:28:50,927 --> 02:28:55,927
Push!

2051
02:29:11,197 --> 02:29:16,197
Come on!

2052
02:29:18,371 --> 02:29:23,371
Come on!

2053
02:29:25,878 --> 02:29:27,087
Watch your backs!

2054
02:29:27,088 --> 02:29:32,088
You thought you could escape me.

2055
02:29:33,261 --> 02:29:38,139
What are you going to do now, Wizard?

2056
02:29:44,188 --> 02:29:49,188
That'll do it.

2057
02:30:20,683 --> 02:30:23,852
Well, that could have been worse.

2058
02:30:23,853 --> 02:30:25,645
Haver!

2059
02:30:25,646 --> 02:30:30,646
You've got to be joking!

2060
02:30:34,155 --> 02:30:35,780
Gandalf!

2061
02:30:40,202 --> 02:30:42,620
There's too many. We can't fight them.

2062
02:30:42,621 --> 02:30:44,873
Only one thing will save us, daylight!

2063
02:30:44,874 --> 02:30:46,291
Come on!

2064
02:30:46,292 --> 02:30:50,378
Here! On your feet.

2065
02:30:50,379 --> 02:30:53,340
- Balin.
- Come on!

2066
02:30:54,425 --> 02:30:56,426
Wait!

2067
02:30:56,427 --> 02:30:59,679
My precious. Wait!

2068
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:03,433
Gollum, gollum!

2069
02:31:07,438 --> 02:31:10,899
Quick, quick!

2070
02:31:10,900 --> 02:31:12,150
This way.

2071
02:31:14,695 --> 02:31:19,695
- Come on.
- Come on, come on. Quickly.

2072
02:31:20,451 --> 02:31:25,451
Right, good!

2073
02:32:49,206 --> 02:32:51,916
Baggins!

2074
02:32:51,917 --> 02:32:54,752
Thief!

2075
02:32:54,753 --> 02:32:59,753
Curse it and crush it!
We hates it forever!

2076
02:33:12,605 --> 02:33:15,523
Five, six, seven, eight.

2077
02:33:15,524 --> 02:33:17,984
Bifur. Bofur. That's 10.

2078
02:33:17,985 --> 02:33:20,778
Fili, Kili! That's 12.

2079
02:33:20,779 --> 02:33:24,699
And Bombur. That makes 13.

2080
02:33:24,700 --> 02:33:26,826
Where's Bilbo?

2081
02:33:26,827 --> 02:33:29,996
Where is our Hobbit?

2082
02:33:29,997 --> 02:33:33,041
Where is our Hobbit?

2083
02:33:33,042 --> 02:33:34,876
Curse that Halfling!

2084
02:33:34,877 --> 02:33:36,169
Now he's lost?

2085
02:33:36,170 --> 02:33:38,338
I thought he was with Dori!

2086
02:33:38,339 --> 02:33:39,589
Don't blame me!

2087
02:33:39,590 --> 02:33:40,924
Where did you last see him?

2088
02:33:40,925 --> 02:33:41,841
I think I saw him...

2089
02:33:41,842 --> 02:33:42,800
...slip away...

2090
02:33:42,801 --> 02:33:43,760
...when they first collared us.

2091
02:33:43,761 --> 02:33:45,386
And what happened, exactly?

2092
02:33:45,387 --> 02:33:47,889
- Tell me!
- I'll tell you what happened.

2093
02:33:47,890 --> 02:33:49,724
Master Baggins saw his chance...

2094
02:33:49,725 --> 02:33:51,518
...and he took it.

2095
02:33:51,519 --> 02:33:54,437
He has thought of nothing
but his soft bed and his warm hearth...

2096
02:33:54,438 --> 02:33:57,315
...since first he stepped out of his door.

2097
02:33:57,316 --> 02:34:00,276
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.

2098
02:34:00,277 --> 02:34:05,277
He is long gone.

2099
02:34:14,041 --> 02:34:16,042
No.

2100
02:34:16,043 --> 02:34:21,005
He isn't.

2101
02:34:21,006 --> 02:34:22,840
Bilbo Baggins.

2102
02:34:22,841 --> 02:34:24,217
I have never been so glad...

2103
02:34:24,218 --> 02:34:27,804
...to see anyone in my life.

2104
02:34:27,805 --> 02:34:28,972
Bilbo.

2105
02:34:28,973 --> 02:34:29,931
We'd given you up.

2106
02:34:29,932 --> 02:34:32,100
How on earth
did you get past the Goblins?

2107
02:34:32,101 --> 02:34:37,021
How, indeed.

2108
02:34:42,820 --> 02:34:46,906
Well, what does it matter? He's back.

2109
02:34:46,907 --> 02:34:48,408
It matters.

2110
02:34:48,409 --> 02:34:51,953
I want to know.

2111
02:34:51,954 --> 02:34:56,954
Why did you come back?

2112
02:34:57,001 --> 02:35:02,001
Look, I know you doubt me.
I know you always have.

2113
02:35:02,298 --> 02:35:05,174
And you're right.
I often think of Bag-end.

2114
02:35:05,175 --> 02:35:07,969
I miss my books.

2115
02:35:07,970 --> 02:35:11,764
And my armchair and my garden.

2116
02:35:11,765 --> 02:35:13,808
See, that's where I belong.

2117
02:35:13,809 --> 02:35:17,270
That's home.

2118
02:35:17,271 --> 02:35:21,691
And that's why I came back. Because...

2119
02:35:21,692 --> 02:35:25,236
...you don't have one. A home.

2120
02:35:25,237 --> 02:35:29,907
It was taken from you.

2121
02:35:29,908 --> 02:35:34,908
But I will help you take it back if I can.

2122
02:35:55,351 --> 02:36:00,351
{\an8}<font color=#FF0000>Gorid dum! Ragshid shirzlum!
<font color=#FFFF00>(Run them down to the end. Tear them to pieces!)</font>

2123
02:36:05,944 --> 02:36:07,612
Out of the frying pan.

2124
02:36:07,613 --> 02:36:10,239
And into the fire. Run.

2125
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:15,240
Run!

2126
02:36:27,383 --> 02:36:32,383
Go!

2127
02:36:55,953 --> 02:36:56,869
Up into the trees!

2128
02:36:56,870 --> 02:36:58,079
All of you!

2129
02:36:58,080 --> 02:37:00,039
Climb! Bilbo, climb!

2130
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:05,040
Quickly!

2131
02:37:11,427 --> 02:37:16,427
They're coming!

2132
02:37:51,008 --> 02:37:53,259
- Hang on!
- Hold on, brothers!

2133
02:38:14,156 --> 02:38:15,990
Azog.

2134
02:38:21,580 --> 02:38:27,000
{\an8}<font color=#FF0000>Nuzdigid? Nuzdi gast?
<font color=#FFFF00>(Do you smell it? The scent of fear?)</font>

2135

{\an8}<font color=#FF0000>Ganziliz i u narug obod nauzdanish... Torin undag Train.
<font color=#FFFF00>(I remembered your father reeked of it... Thorin son of Thrain.)</font>

2136
02:38:42,309 --> 02:38:47,309
It cannot be.

2137
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:58,500
{\an8}<font color=#FF0000>Kod... toragid biriz... Worori-da!
<font color=#FFFF00>(Bring that one to me... Kill the others!)</font>

{\an8}<font color=#FF0000>Shog agradol!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(Drink their blood!)</font>

2139
02:39:37,614 --> 02:39:39,282
It's going!

2140
02:40:28,624 --> 02:40:33,624
Fili!

2141
02:40:54,483 --> 02:40:55,733
Yeah!

2142
02:41:04,743 --> 02:41:06,535
No!

2143
02:41:12,709 --> 02:41:17,709
Oh, no.

2144
02:41:18,966 --> 02:41:23,966
Mr. Gandalf!

2145
02:41:26,306 --> 02:41:29,100
Oh, no, Dori!

2146
02:42:38,295 --> 02:42:43,295
Help!

2147
02:42:57,689 --> 02:43:01,067
No!

2148
02:43:11,578 --> 02:43:16,578
Thorin! No!

2149
02:43:32,599 --> 02:43:37,599
{\an8}<font color=#FF0000>Biriz torag khobdudol!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(Bring me his head!)</font>

2150
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:28,000
{\an8}<font color=#FF0000>{\an8}<font color=#FF0000>Gorid dum!</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>(Kill him!)</font>

2151
02:46:12,384 --> 02:46:14,093
Look.

2152
02:47:01,516 --> 02:47:06,516
Thorin!

2153
02:48:18,134 --> 02:48:23,134
Thorin!

2154
02:48:23,473 --> 02:48:28,473
Thorin.

2155
02:48:42,075 --> 02:48:44,243
The Halfling?

2156
02:48:44,244 --> 02:48:46,703
It's all right.

2157
02:48:46,704 --> 02:48:47,913
Bilbo is here.

2158
02:48:47,914 --> 02:48:50,124
He's quite safe.

2159
02:48:59,801 --> 02:49:04,801
You!

2160
02:49:04,806 --> 02:49:06,765
What were you doing?

2161
02:49:06,766 --> 02:49:07,808
You nearly got...

2162
02:49:07,809 --> 02:49:11,019
...yourself killed!

2163
02:49:11,020 --> 02:49:12,020
Did I not say...

2164
02:49:12,021 --> 02:49:14,773
...that you would be a burden?

2165
02:49:14,774 --> 02:49:18,402
That you would not survive in the Wild?

2166
02:49:18,403 --> 02:49:23,403
That you had no place amongst us?

2167
02:49:25,910 --> 02:49:30,910
I have never been so wrong in all my life.

2168
02:49:41,968 --> 02:49:43,760
I am sorry I doubted you.

2169
02:49:43,761 --> 02:49:46,805
No, I would have doubted me too.

2170
02:49:46,806 --> 02:49:48,056
I'm not a hero...

2171
02:49:48,057 --> 02:49:51,477
...or a warrior.

2172
02:49:51,478 --> 02:49:52,394
Not even...

2173
02:49:52,395 --> 02:49:57,395
...a burglar.

2174
02:50:13,082 --> 02:50:18,082
Is that what I think it is?

2175
02:50:30,558 --> 02:50:33,227
Erebor...

2176
02:50:33,228 --> 02:50:35,020
...the Lonely Mountain...

2177
02:50:35,021 --> 02:50:37,231
...the last of the great Dwarf kingdoms...

2178
02:50:37,232 --> 02:50:42,232
...of Middle-earth.

2179
02:50:42,403 --> 02:50:47,366
Our home.

2180
02:50:48,660 --> 02:50:50,244
A raven!

2181
02:50:50,245 --> 02:50:51,286
The birds...

2182
02:50:51,287 --> 02:50:56,287
...are returning to the mountain.

2183
02:50:56,709 --> 02:50:58,710
That, my dear Oin...

2184
02:50:58,711 --> 02:51:01,713
...is a thrush.

2185
02:51:01,714 --> 02:51:04,049
But we'll take it as a sign.

2186
02:51:04,050 --> 02:51:05,300
A good omen.

2187
02:51:05,301 --> 02:51:07,511
You're right.

2188
02:51:07,512 --> 02:51:12,512
I do believe the worst is behind us.

2189
02:53:03,211 --> 02:53:05,712
<i>Far over

2190
02:53:05,713 --> 02:53:10,713
<i>The misty mountains rise

2191
02:53:11,219 --> 02:53:14,971
<i>Leave us standing

2192
02:53:14,972 --> 02:53:19,017
<i>Upon the height

2193
02:53:19,018 --> 02:53:22,979
<i>What was before

2194
02:53:22,980 --> 02:53:27,109
<i>We see once more

2195
02:53:27,110 --> 02:53:32,110
<i>Is our kingdom a distant light

2196
02:53:34,367 --> 02:53:39,367
<i>Fiery mountain beneath the moon

2197
02:53:41,165 --> 02:53:45,127
<i>The words unspoken

2198
02:53:45,128 --> 02:53:49,297
<i>We'll be there soon

2199
02:53:49,298 --> 02:53:53,301
<i>For home a song

2200
02:53:53,302 --> 02:53:57,347
<i>That echoes on

2201
02:53:57,348 --> 02:54:02,348
<i>And all who find us will know the tune

2202
02:54:06,023 --> 02:54:10,026
<i>Some folk we never forget

2203
02:54:10,027 --> 02:54:14,197
<i>Some kind we never forgive

2204
02:54:14,198 --> 02:54:18,285
<i>Haven't seen the back of us yet

2205
02:54:18,286 --> 02:54:22,289
<i>We'll fight as long as we live

2206
02:54:22,290 --> 02:54:26,209
<i>All eyes on the hidden door

2207
02:54:26,210 --> 02:54:30,338
<i>To the Lonely Mountain borne

2208
02:54:30,339 --> 02:54:34,134
<i>We'll ride in the gathering storm

2209
02:54:34,135 --> 02:54:39,135
<i>Until we get our long-forgotten gold

2210
02:54:41,142 --> 02:54:43,518
<i>We lay under

2211
02:54:43,519 --> 02:54:48,519
<i>The misty mountains cold

2212
02:54:48,858 --> 02:54:52,527
<i>In slumbers deep

2213
02:54:52,528 --> 02:54:56,823
<i>And dreams of gold

2214
02:54:56,824 --> 02:55:00,911
<i>We must awake

2215
02:55:00,912 --> 02:55:04,915
<i>Our lives to make

2216
02:55:04,916 --> 02:55:09,916
<i>And in the darkness a torch we hold

2217
02:55:12,006 --> 02:55:17,006
<i>From long ago when lanterns burned

2218
02:55:19,013 --> 02:55:23,058
<i>Until this day

2219
02:55:23,059 --> 02:55:27,062
<i>Our hearts have yearned

2220
02:55:27,063 --> 02:55:31,191
<i>Her fate unknown

2221
02:55:31,192 --> 02:55:35,320
<i>The Arkenstone

2222
02:55:35,321 --> 02:55:39,157
<i>What was stolen

2223
02:55:39,158 --> 02:55:44,158
<i>Must be returned

2224
02:55:57,343 --> 02:56:01,304
<i>We must awake

2225
02:56:01,305 --> 02:56:05,350
<i>And make the day

2226
02:56:05,351 --> 02:56:09,187
<i>To find a song

2227
02:56:09,188 --> 02:56:14,188
<i>For heart and soul

2228
02:56:15,027 --> 02:56:19,072
<i>Some folk we never forget

2229
02:56:19,073 --> 02:56:23,243
<i>Some kind we never forgive

2230
02:56:23,244 --> 02:56:27,372
<i>Haven't seen the end of it yet

2231
02:56:27,373 --> 02:56:31,293
<i>We'll fight as long as we live

2232
02:56:31,294 --> 02:56:35,338
<i>All eyes on the hidden door

2233
02:56:35,339 --> 02:56:39,426
<i>To the Lonely Mountain borne

2234
02:56:39,427 --> 02:56:43,430
<i>We'll ride in the gathering storm

2235
02:56:43,431 --> 02:56:48,431
<i>Till we get our long-forgotten gold

2236
02:56:49,896 --> 02:56:52,564
<i>Far away

2237
02:56:52,565 --> 02:56:57,565
<i>From misty mountains cold
