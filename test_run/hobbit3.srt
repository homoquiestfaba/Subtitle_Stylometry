00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:16,090
<font color="#ffff00">MASTER</font>: I warned you.

3
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:18,175
Did I not warn you what would
come of dealing with dwarves?

4
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:19,677
Now they've done it.

5
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,078
They've woken the dragon.

6
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,180
They've brought an apocalypse
upon our heads.

7
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:25,516
Come on! Quickly! Quickly!

8
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,686
Faster now, I'm trying
to evacuate myself here.

9
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,187
Careful, man.

10
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:31,389
Never mind the books.

11
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,090
Get on. Get the rest of it!

12
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,825
<font color="#ffff00">ALFRID</font>: But, sire, should we not
try to save the town?

13
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:36,761
The town is lost. Save the gold!

14
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,262
<font color="#ffff00">BRAGA</font>: You heard him.
Get a move on.

15
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,165
<font color="#ffff00">GIRL</font>: Da! Come on, we must go.

16
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:43,901
<font color="#ffff00">MAN ♪2</font>: Pile 'em up!

17
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,716
We have no time. We must leave.

18
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,050
<font color="#ffff00">BOFUR</font>: Get him up.

19
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:01,385
- Come on, brother.
- Come on, come on. Let's go.

20
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,853
I'm fine. I can walk.

21
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:04,922
Fast as you can.
We're not leaving.

22
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,290
Not without our father.

23
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,959
If you stay here,
your sisters will die.

24
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,429
Is that what your father
would want?

25
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,199
Open this door!

26
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,767
Do you hear me?!

27
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,045
<font color="#ffff00">WOMAN</font>: Look!

28
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,580

00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,615
Fili: Give me your hand. BOFUR: Come on.
We gotta go.

30
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:33,484
Quickly, now.

31
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,319
- Hurry!
- <font color="#ffff00">FILI</font>: Kili, come on!

32
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,620
<font color="#ffff00">Man ♪4</font>: It's 'round the corner!

33
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:38,222

34
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:46,897
<font color="#ffff00">WOMAN</font>: Aah!

35
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:48,466
<font color="#ffff00">MAN</font>: Dragon!

37
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,671
Faster! Faster!

38
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:33,277
If only we could take more of
these poor people with us.

39
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,612
But they're hardly...

40
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,680
Worth it. I quite agree.

41
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:45,256
<font color="#ffff00">BOFUR</font>: Look out!

42
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,330
<font color="#ffff00">Master</font>: Move it, move it!

43
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,666
Come on! Faster!

44
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,001
My gold! My gold!

45
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,669
We're carrying too much weight.

46
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,404
We need to dump something.

47
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,208
Quite right, alfrid.

48
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:08,078
Huh? Huh?

49
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,681
Ah, ah, ah, aah!

50
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,216
Faster! Faster!

51
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,661
Poor souls.

52
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,563
Da.

53
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,998
Da!

54
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,905
- He hit it! He hit the dragon!
- No.

55
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:23,774
He did! He hit his mark! I saw!

56
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,176
His arrows
cannot Pierce its hide.

57
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:28,846
I fear nothing will.

58
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:42,893
What are you doin'?!

59
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:47,297
<font color="#ffff00">FILI</font>: Come back! Bain! Bain!

60
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:49,366
<font color="#ffff00">TAURIEL</font>: Leave him.

61
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,201
We cannot go back.

62
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:52,302
Bain!

63
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,094
Dad!

64
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,129
Bain! What are you doing?!
Why didn't you leave?!

65
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,464
You were supposed to leave!

66
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,565
I came to help you.

67
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,934
- No!
- Nothing can stop it now.

68
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,502
<i>This</i> might.

69
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,575
Bain. You go back.

70
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,911
You get out of here. Now.

71
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:38,015
Dad!

72
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,121
Bain!

73
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,224
Aah!

74
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,069
Stop, stop! Halt! Halt!

75
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:11,915
Who are you that would stand
against me?

76
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:20,457
Now that<i> is</i> a pity.

77
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,293
What will you do now...

78
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:24,962
Bowman?

79
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,532
You are forsaken.

80
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:32,135
No help will come.

81
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:34,872
<font color="#ffff00">Master</font>: Now's our chance!

82
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:35,839
Go! Go!

83
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,508
Head for the open water!

84
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,178
Hmm. Ah.

85
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,381
Is that<i> your</i> child?

86
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,987
You cannot save him
from the fire.

87
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:54,391
He will<i> burn.</i>

88
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:16,179
Stay still, son. Stay still.

89
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:20,350
Tell me,<i> wretch,</i>

90
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:25,923
how now shall<i> you</i> challenge<i> me?</i>

91
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,030
You have nothing left...

92
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,033
But your death!

93
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,571
Bain. Look at me.

94
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:44,274
You look at me.

95
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,615
Little to your left.

96
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,684
That's it.

97
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:59,389
Ah!

98
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,369
Bain! Hold on!

99
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,444
What was that?

100
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:55,846
What happened?

101
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,215
It fell. I saw it.

102
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,185
It's dead.

103
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,524
Smaug is dead.

104
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:11,895
<font color="#ffff00">GLOIN</font>: By my beard,
I think he's right!

105
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,964
Look there!

106
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,967
The ravens of Erebor

107
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,870
are returning to the mountain.

108
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,572
Aye. Word will spread.

109
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:25,976
Before long every soul
in middle-earth

110
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,645
will know the dragon is dead!

111
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,854
<font color="#ffff00">GALADRIEL</font>: <i>You are not alone,

113
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,541

114
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:33,543
Help!

115
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:37,881
Aah! Aah!

116

<font color="#ffff00">MAN</font>: Over there!

117
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,053
Da!

118
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,554
Da!

119
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,756
Da!

120
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,598
Aah! Why me?!

121
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:05,008
Tauriel.

122
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,910
<font color="#ffff00">FILI</font>: Kili!

123
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,578
Come on.

124
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,080
We're leaving.

125
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,649
They are your people.
You must go.

126
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,586
Come with me.

127
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:19,923
I know how I feel.
I'm not afraid.

128
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,591
You make me feel alive.

129
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:22,459
Oh, I can't.

130
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,094
Tauriel.

131
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,263
Amralimé.

132
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,102
I don't know what that means.

133
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:36,339
I think you do.

134
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,434
<font color="#ffff00">DWARF</font>: One more!

135
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,985
Keep it.

136
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,254
As a promise.

137
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,216
These are dry. You'll need them.

138
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,684
- Thank you.
- Here.

139
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:56,853
Oi! Give me one of them.

140
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,189
I'll catch my death
in this cold.

141
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,857
Oh, find your own!

142
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,026
You're not in charge now,
alfrid lickspittle.

143
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,361
That is where you are wrong.

144
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,363
In the absence of the master,

145
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,564
the power cedes to his deputy,

146
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,933
which in this instance
is my good self.

147
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,868
Now give me that blanket!

148
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,938
Master's deputy?

149
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,573
Don't make me laugh.

150
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,575
You're a sneak-thief, more like.

151
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,044
I'll be dead before I answer
to the likes of you.

152
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:24,447
Maybe that can be arranged.

153
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,654
I wouldn't go turning
on your own, alfrid.

154
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,056
Not now.

155
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,125
Ugh!

156
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,128
Da!

157
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,895
Come here!

158
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,630
You're alive!

159
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:43,500
It's all right, darling.

160
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,438
<font color="#ffff00">PERCY</font>: It was bard!

161
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,007
He killed the dragon!
I saw it with me own eyes.

162
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,575
He brought the beast down!

163
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:55,111
Shot him dead
with a black arrow.

164
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,481
Thank you, bard!

165
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,250
<font color="#ffff00">WOMAN</font>: Thank you!

166
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,488
You've saved us all! Bless you.

167
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:11,261
All hail to the dragon slayer!

168
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,164
All hail king bard!

169
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,368
I have said it many times.

170
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,271
This is a man of noble stock.

171
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,472
A born leader!

172
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,841
<font color="#ffff00">Bard</font>: Do not call me that.

173
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,110
I'm not the master of this town.

174
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,280
Where is he?!

175
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,548
Where's the master?!

176
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,450
<font color="#ffff00">Woman</font>: Halfway down the anduin.

177
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,452
With all our coin,
I don't doubt.

178
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,720
You would know.

179
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,189
You helped him empty
the treasury.

180
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,490
No.

181
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,792
I tried to stop him.

182
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,527
- Liar!
- Cheat!

183
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:46,129
You're a mongrel!

184
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,664
I begged. I pleaded.

185
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,066
- Let's do away with him!
- Tar him!

186
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:53,503
I said, "master, no!"

187
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,974
"Think of the children."

188
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,409
Hang him!

189
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,645
"Will nobody think
of the children?!?"

190
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:04,414
Aah!

191
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,217
To the tree with him!

192
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,322
Aah!

193
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,357
- Hang him high!
- Take him down!

194
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,393
Enough!

195
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,261
Let him go! Let him go!

196
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,400
Look around you!

197
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:27,370
Have you not had your fill
of death?!

198
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:31,941
Winter is upon us.

199
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:34,344
We must look to our own.

200
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,113
To the sick and the helpless.

201
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:40,550
Those who can stand,
tend to the wounded.

202
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,352
And those who have strength
left, follow me.

203
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,020
We must salvage what we can.

204
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,589
And what then?
What'll we do then?

205
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,029
We find shelter.

206
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:40,243
<font color="#ffff00">Bofur</font>: Hello!

207
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,512
Bombur?

208
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,148
Bifur?

209
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,585
Anybody?

210
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,092
<font color="#ffff00">BILBO</font>: Wait!

211
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,293
Wait!

212
00:19:57,295 --> 00:19:59,162
- It's bilbo!
- He's alive!

213
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:02,131
Stop! Stop! Stop.

214
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:05,468
You need to leave.
We all need to leave.

215
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,103
We only just got here.

216
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,339
I've tried talking to him,
but he won't listen.

217
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,107
What do you mean, laddie?
Thorin!

218
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,843
- Thorin. Thorin.
- He's been down there for days.

219
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,312
He doesn't sleep.
He barely eats.

220
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:19,616
He's not been himself.
Not at all.

221
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,384
It's this... it's this place.

222
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,552
I think a sickness lies on it.

223
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,053
<font color="#ffff00">KILI</font>: Sickness?

224
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:27,190
What kind of sickness?

225
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,560
Fili. Fili!

226
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,229
Fili!

227
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,827
<font color="#ffff00">THORIN</font>: Gold.

228
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:09,098
Gold beyond measure.

229
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,236
Beyond sorrow...

230
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,171
And grief.

231
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,714
Behold the great...

232
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:29,118
Treasure hoard of thror.

233
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:40,330
Welcome my sister-sons...

234
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,536
to the kingdom...

235
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,538
Of Erebor.

236
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,576
Balin!

237
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,448
Kili!

238
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,951
Balin:
Thank Durin, you're alive!

239
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,553
Bombur!

240
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,722
<font color="#ffff00">ORI</font>: You're alive!

241
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:08,391
<font color="#ffff00">Thorin</font>: Any sign of it?

242
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,492
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: Nothing yet.

243
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,793
<font color="#ffff00">ORI</font>: Nothing here.

244
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:12,061
Keep searching!

245
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:13,229
<font color="#ffff00">OIN</font>: That Jewel
could be anywhere.

246
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,632
The Arkenstone
is in these halls.

247
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,833
Find it!

248
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,401
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: You heard him.
Keep looking.

249
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,236
All of you!

250
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,006
No one rests until it is found.

251
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:58,007
<i>I am almost tempted
to let you take it.</i>

252
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:03,312
<i>If only to see
Oakenshield suffer.</i>

253
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:07,116
<i>Watch it destroy him.</i>

254
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:11,387
<i>Watch it corrupt his heart</i>

255
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:14,023
<i>and drive him</i> mad.

256
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,687
<font color="#ffff00">MAN</font>: I've got you.

257
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,492
<font color="#ffff00">Bard</font>: Take only what you need.

258
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,394
We have a long march ahead.

259
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,497
Where will you go?

260
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,066
There is only one place.

261
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,871
<font color="#ffff00">ALFRID</font>: The mountain.

262
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,607
You are a genius, sire.

263
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,677
We can take refuge
inside the mountain.

264
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,045
It might smell a bit of dragon,

265
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,680
but the women can clean that up.

266
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,249
It'll be safe and warm and dry

267
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:17,286
and full of stores,
bedding, clothing,

268
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:19,856
the odd bit o' gold.

269
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,359
What gold is in that mountain
is cursed.

270
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,862
- We will take only.
- What was promised to us.

271
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:29,899
Only what we need
to rebuild our lives.

272
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,535
Here. Pull your weight.

273
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:33,870
News of the death of Smaug

274
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,072
will have spread
through the lands.

275
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,040
Aye.

276
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:44,480
Others will now look
to the mountain...

277
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,415
For its wealth,

278
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:47,884
for its position.

279
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,719
What is it you know?

280
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,722
Nothing for certain.

281
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:55,925
It's what I fear may come.

282
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:06,629
You saw something out there.

283
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:10,199
The orc I pursued out of
lake-town, I know who he is.

284
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,469
Bolg, spawn of Azog the defiler.

285
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,304
A warg pack was waiting for him

286
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:17,006
on the outskirts of esgaroth.

287
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,307
They fled into the north.

288
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:20,476
These orcs were different
from the others.

289
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:23,546
They bore a mark I have not seen
for a long time.

290
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,381
The mark of gundabad.

291
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,482
Gundabad?

292
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,985
An orc stronghold
in the far north

293
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,319
of the misty mountains.

294
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,502
You may tell my father

295
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,672
if there is no place
for Tauriel,

296
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,741
there is no place for me.

297
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,943
Legolas...

298
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,146
It is your king's command.

299
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,920
I ride north.
Will you come with me?

300
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,755
To where?

301
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,090
To gundabad.

302
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:15,284
I come for mithrandir.

303
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,821
And I will leave with him.

304
00:29:25,028 --> 00:29:27,562
If you try to stop me,
I will destroy you.

305
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:04,934
Nine for mortal men
doomed to die.

306
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:43,472
I am not alone.

307
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,786
Are you in need of assistance,
my lady?

308
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,761
You should've stayed dead.

309
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,430
Ah!

310
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,557
Mithrandir...

311
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,192
Come back.

312
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,690
He is here.

313
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,358
Yes.

314
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,595
The darkness has returned.

315
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,570
Come on! Oh! Whoa!

316
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,409
<font color="#ffff00">RADAGAST</font>: Gandalf!

317
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:30,879
Gandalf! Climb on!

318
00:32:30,881 --> 00:32:34,450
He is weak.
He cannot remain here.

319
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,419
It is draining his life.

320
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,425
Go! Quickly!

321
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:48,764
Come with me, my lady.

322
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:58,607
Go!

323
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:12,614
You have no power here...

324
00:34:12,616 --> 00:34:15,651
Servant of morgoth.

325
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,857
You are nameless!

326
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,961
Faceless.

327
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,465
Formless.

328
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:35,971
Go back to the void

329
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:41,810
from whence you came!

330
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:04,166
The spirit of Sauron endured.

331
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:07,169
And has been banished.

332
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,571
He will flee into the east.

333
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:13,675
Gondor should be warned.

334
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:16,445
They must set a watch
on the walls of mordor.

335
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,280
<font color="#ffff00">SARUMAN</font>: No.

336
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,182
Look after the lady Galadriel.

337
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,551
She has spent much of her power.

338
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,353
Her strength is failing.

339
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,021
Take her to lothlórien.

340
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,523
My lord saruman.

341
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,425
He must be hunted down

342
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,627
and destroyed once and for all.

343
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,529
Without the ring of power.

344
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:37,566
Sauron can never again hold
dominion over middle-earth.

345
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,103
Go now.

346
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:45,707
Leave Sauron to me.

347
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:54,316
- I need that horse.
- What?

348
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,618
Gandalf, where are you going?

349
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,387
To warn Erebor.

350
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,556
They have no idea
what is coming.

351
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,458
I saw them with my own eyes.

352
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,127
Rank upon rank of Moria orcs!

353
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,230
You must summon our friends,
bird and beast.

354
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:11,733
The battle for the mountain
is about to begin.

355
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:13,168
Wait.

356
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,739
Take this.

357
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,610
If what you say is true,

358
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,745
then you'll need it more than I.

359
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,650
Thank you.

360
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:30,953
A word of warning...

361
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:34,423
It... Can be a bit dicky
sometimes.

362
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,793
You just have to twiddle
with the top.

363
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:41,196
I expect you'll manage.

364
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,537
Thorin:
It is here in these halls.

365
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,771
I know it.

366
00:36:49,773 --> 00:36:52,040
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: We have searched
and searched.

367
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:53,609
Not well enough.

368
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,611
Thorin, we all would see
the stone returned.

369
00:36:55,613 --> 00:37:00,782
And yet, it is still not found!

370
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:06,221
Do you doubt the loyalty
of anyone here?

371
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:19,334
The Arkenstone is the birthright
of our people.

372
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:22,804
It is the king's Jewel.

373
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:25,941
Am I not the king?!

374
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,721
Know this.

375
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,226
If anyone should find it

376
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:48,397
and withhold it from me...

377
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,066
I will be avenged.

378
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:08,150
Dragon-sickness.

379
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,253
I've seen it before.

380
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:14,690
That look.

381
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,858
That terrible need.

382
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,263
It is a fierce
and jealous love, bilbo.

383
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,767
It sent his grandfather mad.

384
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:29,471
Balin, if... If Thorin...

385
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,708
Had the Arkenstone...

386
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,112
Or if it... If it was found...

387
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:40,882
Would it help?

388
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:46,722
That stone crowns all.

389
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,925
It is the summit
of this great wealth...

390
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:53,495
Bestowing power
upon he who bears it.

391
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,665
Would it stay his madness?

392
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,800
No, laddie.

393
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,738
I fear it would make him worse.

394
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:07,509
Perhaps it is best...

395
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,178
It remains lost.

396
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:25,093
What is that?

397
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,863
In your hand!

398
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:28,997
It's... it's nothing.

399
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,699
Show me.

400
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:44,112
I picked it up
in beorn's garden.

401
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,950
You've carried it all this way?

402
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:51,153
I'm gonna plant it in my garden.

403
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:53,455
In bag end.

404
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:59,561
It's a poor prize to take back
to the shire.

405
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,731
One day, it'll grow.

406
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,301
And every time I look at it,
I'll remember.

407
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,870
Remember everything
that happened.

408
00:40:08,872 --> 00:40:10,205
The good, the bad...

409
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:13,375
And how lucky I am
that I made it home.

410
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,752
Thorin, I...

411
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,587
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: Thorin.

412
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,856
The survivors from lake-town...

413
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:31,526
They're streaming in to Dale.

414
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:33,495
There's hundreds of them.

415
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:37,999
Call everyone to the gate.

416
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:41,937
To the gate! Now!

417
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,702
<font color="#ffff00">BARD</font>: Come on. Keep moving.

418
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,604
<font color="#ffff00">ALFRID</font>: Sire!

419
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,539
Sire!

420
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,375
Up here!

421
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:30,385
Look, sire!
The braziers are lit.

422
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,220
So...

423
00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:35,423
- The company of.
- Thorin Oakenshield survived.

424
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:37,726
Survived?

425
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,095
You mean there's a bunch of dwarves
in there with all that gold?

426
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,898
I shouldn't worry, alfrid.

427
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,667
There's gold enough
in that mountain for all.

428
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,936
Make camp here tonight!

429
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,905
Find what shelter you can.

430
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,807
Get some fires going.

431
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,142
Percy:
Come on, hurry along, now.

432
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:57,412
- Alfrid.
- You take the night watch.

433
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,155
<font color="#ffff00">BOFUR</font>: Up it goes!

434
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,093
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: That's it.

435
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,532
<font color="#ffff00">THORIN</font>: I want this fortress
made safe by sunup.

436
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:19,868
This mountain was hard-won.

437
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,003
I will not see it taken again.

438
00:42:22,005 --> 00:42:24,306
The people of lake-town
have nothing.

439
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:28,610
They came to us in need.
They have lost everything.

440
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:32,047
Do not tell<i> me</i>
what<i> they</i> have lost.

441
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,617
I know well enough
their hardship.

442
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:41,056
Those who have lived through
dragon fire should rejoice.

443
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:45,126
They have much
to be grateful for.

444
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:51,032
More stone!

445
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,037
Bring more stone to the gate!

446
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,560
Man:
These children are starving.

447
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,061
We need food.

448
00:43:20,063 --> 00:43:22,330
<font color="#ffff00">Percy</font>: We won't last three days.

449
00:43:22,332 --> 00:43:23,565
Bard, we don't have enough.

450
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,433
Do what you can, Percy.

451
00:43:25,435 --> 00:43:28,069
<font color="#ffff00">MAN</font>: It'll be all right.
Don't worry.

452
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:30,572
<font color="#ffff00">Woman</font>: We need more water.

453
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:33,341
The children, the wounded
and the women come first.

454
00:43:33,343 --> 00:43:34,910
Here you are.

455
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:36,511
Good morning, alfrid.

456
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:38,914
What news from the night watch?

457
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,683
All quiet, sire.
Not much to report.

458
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:44,452
Nothing gets past me.

459
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:54,562
Except an army of elves,
it would seem.

460
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:37,339
My lord thranduil.

461
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,840
We did not look to see you here.

462
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,675
I heard you needed aid.

463
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,365
Here you go!

464
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,333
Another one!

465
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,504
<font color="#ffff00">Bard</font>: You have saved us.

466
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,873
I do not know how to thank you.

467
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,942
Your gratitude is misplaced.

468
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,611
I did not come on your behalf.

469
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:20,615
I came to reclaim
something of mine.

470
00:45:26,656 --> 00:45:31,226
There are gems in the mountain
that I, too, desire.

471
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,062
White gems of pure starlight.

472
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:38,333
The white gems of lasgalen.

473
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:42,570
I know an elf lord who will pay
a pretty price for these.

474
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:51,379
Wait! Please wait!

475
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,151
You would go to war
over a handful of gems?

476
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:59,821
The heirlooms of my people
are not lightly forsaken.

477
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:01,389
We are allies in this.

478
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,992
My people also have a claim

479
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,995
upon the riches
in that mountain.

480
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,030
Let me speak with Thorin.

481
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,600
You would try to reason
with the dwarf?

482
00:46:12,602 --> 00:46:14,669
To avoid war?

483
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,004
Yes.

484
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:20,175
<font color="#ffff00">Gloin</font>: Not a bad night's work.

485
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,776
Come on.

486
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:46,434
Hail, Thorin, son of thrain.

487
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:50,105
We are glad to find you alive
beyond hope.

488
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,639
Why do you come to the gates

489
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:54,442
of the king under the mountain
armed for war?

490
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:57,745
Why does the king under
the mountain fence himself in

491
00:46:57,747 --> 00:47:00,582
like a robber in his hold?

492
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:04,752
Perhaps it is because I am
expecting to be robbed.

493
00:47:04,754 --> 00:47:06,454
My lord...

494
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,224
We have not come to rob you,

495
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,926
but to seek fair settlement.

496
00:47:11,928 --> 00:47:14,562
Will you not speak with me?

497
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:50,665
I am listening.

498
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:53,434
On behalf of the people
of lake-town,

499
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:56,037
I ask that you honor
your pledge.

500
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,772
A share of the treasure

501
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:00,175
so that they might rebuild
their lives.

502
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:03,478
I will not treat with any man

503
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,347
while an armed host
lies before my door.

504
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:08,616
- That armed host.
- Will attack this mountain

505
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:10,285
if we do not come to terms.

506
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:14,322
And your threats do not sway me.

507
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:17,559
What of your conscience?

508
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,129
Does it not tell you
our cause is just?

509
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:25,033
My people offered you help.

510
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,901
And in return,

511
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:30,505
you brought upon them
only ruin and death.

512
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,473
When did the men of lake-town
come to our aid

513
00:48:32,475 --> 00:48:34,075
but for the promise
of rich reward?

514
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,710
A bargain was struck!

515
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:36,978
A bargain?

516
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,346
What choice did we have

517
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,482
but to barter our birthright
for blankets and food,

518
00:48:41,484 --> 00:48:44,485
to ransom our future in exchange
for our freedom?

519
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:47,555
You call that a fair trade?

520
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:54,329
Tell me, bard
the dragon slayer...

521
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:57,565
Why should I honor such terms?

522
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:02,804
Because you gave us your word.

523
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:07,976
Does that mean nothing?

524
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,524
Begone!

525
00:49:23,526 --> 00:49:26,060
Ere our arrows fly!

526
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,447
<font color="#ffff00">Bilbo</font>: What are you doing?

527
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:50,251
You cannot go to war.

528
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:52,754
This does not concern you.

529
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,889
Excuse me, but just in case
you haven't noticed,

530
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,392
there is an army of elves
out there.

531
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:01,129
Not to mention several hundred
angry fishermen.

532
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,964
W-we are, in fact, outnumbered.

533
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,834
Not for much longer.

534
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,437
What does that mean?

535
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:12,006
It means, master Baggins...

536
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,978
you should never
underestimate dwarves.

537
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,350
We have reclaimed Erebor.

538
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:26,487
Now we defend it.

539
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,374
He will give us nothing.

540
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,509
Such a pity.

541
00:50:48,511 --> 00:50:50,845
Still, you tried.

542
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,780
I do not understand.

543
00:50:52,782 --> 00:50:55,016
Why?

544
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:57,218
Why would he risk war?

545
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,233
It is fruitless to reason
with them.

546
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,536
They understand only one thing.

547
00:51:19,008 --> 00:51:21,042
We attack at dawn.

548
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,079
Are you with us?

549
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:58,112
Aye.

550
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:05,420
Thorin:
Master Baggins, come here.

551
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,372
You're going to need this.

552
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,707
Put it on.

553
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:34,449
This vest is made
of silver steel.

554
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:40,688
"Mithril" it was called
by my forebears.

555
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,626
No blade can Pierce it.

556
00:52:56,105 --> 00:52:57,338
I look absurd.

557
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,174
I'm not a warrior, I'm a hobbit.

558
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,410
It is a gift.

559
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:05,146
A token of our friendship.

560
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,752
True friends
are hard to come by.

561
00:53:11,754 --> 00:53:16,591
I have been blind
but now I begin to see.

562
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:19,193
I am betrayed.

563
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:22,196
Betrayed?

564
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:24,932
The Arkenstone.

565
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:35,510
One of them has taken it.

566
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:45,987
One of them is false.

567
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:50,191
Thorin, the quest<i> is</i> fulfilled.

568
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:51,526
You've won the mountain.

569
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:53,494
Is that not enough?

570
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:55,696
Betrayed by my own kin.

571
00:53:55,698 --> 00:53:57,164
Now, uh, you...

572
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,967
You made a promise to the people
of lake-town.

573
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:04,171
Now, I-is this treasure truly
worth more than your honor?

574
00:54:04,173 --> 00:54:06,507
<i>Our</i> honor, Thorin.
I was also there.

575
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:07,708
I gave my word.

576
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,477
For that, I am grateful.

577
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:10,811
It was nobly done.

578
00:54:10,813 --> 00:54:12,213
But the treasure
in this mountain

579
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:15,149
does not belong to the people
of lake-town.

580
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,284
This gold...

581
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:22,690
is ours.

582
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:26,727
And ours alone.

583
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,666
By my life...

584
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:34,936
I will not part

585
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:39,340
with a s-s-s-s-single coin.

586
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,677
Not...

587
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:48,449
One piece of it.

588
00:55:08,404 --> 00:55:10,104
<font color="#ffff00">TAURIEL</font>: Gundabad.

589
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,642
What lies beyond?

590
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:19,947
- An old enemy.
- The ancient kingdom of angmar.

591
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:25,086
This fortress was once
its stronghold.

592
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,722
It is where they kept
their great armories.

593
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:30,791
Forged their weapons of war.

594
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:33,794
A light. I saw movement.

595
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:38,599
We wait for the cover of night.

596
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:41,469
It is a fell place, Tauriel.

597
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:42,903
In another age,

598
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:45,973
our people waged war
on those lands.

599
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:58,019
My mother died there.

600
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:02,857
My father does not speak of it.

601
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,693
There is no grave.

602
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,095
No memory.

603
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,166
Nothing.

604
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,874
Ugh!

605
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,643
Let me through!

606
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,946
Make way!

607
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:41,962
<font color="#ffff00">ALFRID</font>: No, no, no! Oi!

608
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:43,164
You!

609
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,699
Pointy hat!

610
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,068
Yes.

611
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,502
You.

612
00:56:48,504 --> 00:56:50,071
We don't want no tramps,
beggars,

613
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,505
nor vagabonds 'round here.

614
00:56:51,507 --> 00:56:54,175
We got enough trouble
without the likes of you.

615
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:58,212
Off you go. On your horse.

616
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:00,147
Who's in charge here?

617
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:01,382
Who is asking?

618
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:08,689
You must set aside your petty
grievances with the dwarves.

619
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:10,024
War is coming!

620
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:13,027
The cesspits of Dol Guldur
have been emptied.

621
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:16,497
You're all in mortal danger.

622
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:17,932
What are you talking about?

623
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:21,836
I can see you know nothing
of wizards.

624
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,538
They are like winter thunder
on a wild wind

625
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:28,242
rolling in from a distance,
breaking hard in alarm.

626
00:57:29,378 --> 00:57:33,748
But sometimes a storm
is just a storm.

627
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,549
Not this time.

628
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:38,119
Armies of orcs are on the move.

629
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,788
- These are fighters.
- They have been bred for war.

630
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,691
Our enemy has summoned
his full strength.

631
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,526
Why show his hand now?

632
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:46,927
Because we forced him.

633
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:49,296
We forced him when the company
of Thorin Oakenshield

634
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:51,966
set out to reclaim
their homeland.

635
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,602
The dwarves were never meant
to reach Erebor.

636
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:57,438
Azog the defiler was sent
to kill them.

637
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,941
His master seeks control
of the mountain.

638
00:58:00,943 --> 00:58:05,446
Not just for the treasure within
but for where it lies,

639
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:07,148
its strategic position.

640
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:11,552
This is the gateway to
reclaiming the lands of angmar

641
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:12,720
in the north.

642
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:16,056
If that fell kingdom
should rise again...

643
00:58:16,058 --> 00:58:19,627
Rivendell, lórien, the shire...

644
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,730
Even gondor itself will fall.

645
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,966
These orc armies
you speak of, mithrandir,

646
00:58:25,968 --> 00:58:29,003
where are they?

647
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:24,458
<font color="#ffff00">LEGOLAS</font>: These bats are bred
for one purpose.

648
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,361
For what?

649
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:29,463
For war.

650
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:53,314
You should be inside...

651
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,581
Oh!

652
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:56,417
Out of the wind.

653
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,453
No, I, uh...

654
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:00,888
Needed some air.

655
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,324
Place still stinks of dragon.

656
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:12,333
The elves have been moving
their archers into position.

657
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,500
Ah.

658
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:18,072
The battle will be over
by tomorrow's Eve...

659
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,641
Though I doubt
we will live to see it.

660
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:27,314
These are... Dark days.

661
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:30,551
Dark days indeed.

662
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:36,090
No one could blame a soul

663
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:38,392
for wishing themselves
elsewhere.

664
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,266
Must be near midnight.

665
01:01:46,268 --> 01:01:48,135
Bombur's got the next watch.

666
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,171
It'll take a bit to wake him.

667
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:54,541
Bofur...

668
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,713
I will see you in the morning.

669
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:03,550
Goodbye, bilbo.

670
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:50,597
<font color="#ffff00">GANDALF</font>: Since when has my
counsel counted for so little?

671
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:52,533
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

672
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:55,369
I think you're trying to save
your dwarvish friends.

673
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:57,204
And I admire your loyalty
to them.

674
01:02:57,206 --> 01:03:01,375
But it does not dissuade me
from my course.

675
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:03,544
You started this, mithrandir.

676
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:07,214
You will forgive me
if I finish it.

677
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:10,184
Are the archers in position?

678
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:11,685
Yes, my lord.

679
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:13,087
Give the order.

680
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:16,757
If anything moves
on that mountain, kill it.

681
01:03:19,728 --> 01:03:22,196
The dwarves are out of time.

682
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,364
Bowman!

683
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:25,566
Do you agree with this?

684
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:28,202
Is gold so important to you?

685
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:32,039
Would you buy it with the blood
of dwarves?!

686
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,240
It will not come to that.

687
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:34,541
This is a fight they cannot win.

688
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:36,243
<font color="#ffff00">Bilbo</font>: That won't stop them.

689
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:39,379
You think the dwarves
will surrender? They won't.

690
01:03:39,381 --> 01:03:41,615
They will fight to the death
to defend their own.

691
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,217
Bilbo Baggins!

692
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,619
If I'm not mistaken,

693
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:49,456
this is the halfling who stole
the keys to my dungeons

694
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:51,792
from under the nose
of my guards.

695
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:56,163
Yes.

696
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,565
Sorry about that.

697
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:01,835
I came...

698
01:04:01,837 --> 01:04:04,138
To give you this.

699
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,677
The heart of the mountain.

700
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:13,580
The king's Jewel.

701
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:17,484
And worth a king's ransom.

702
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:21,288
How is this yours to give?

703
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,690
I took it as my 14th share
of the treasure.

704
01:04:23,692 --> 01:04:26,293
Why would you do this?

705
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:27,928
You owe us no loyalty.

706
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,897
I'm not doing it for you.

707
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:34,434
I know that dwarves
can be obstinate

708
01:04:34,436 --> 01:04:37,004
and pigheaded and difficult.

709
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,473
They're suspicious and secretive

710
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:41,308
with the worst manners
you can possibly imagine.

711
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,777
But they are also brave

712
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:46,013
and kind...

713
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:48,115
And loyal to a fault.

714
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:50,384
I've grown very fond of 'em,

715
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,853
and I would save them if I can.

716
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:57,357
Now, Thorin values this stone
above all else.

717
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:58,992
In exchange for its return,

718
01:04:58,994 --> 01:05:01,528
I believe he will give you
what you are owed.

719
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,698
There will be no need for war.

720
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:11,705
- Rest up tonight.
- You must leave on the morrow.

721
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:13,173
What?

722
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:15,008
Get as far away from here
as possible.

723
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:16,176
- I-I'm not leaving.
- Hmm?

724
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:17,544
You picked me as the 14th man.

725
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:19,413
I'm not about to leave
the company now.

726
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,582
There is no company.
Not anymore.

727
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,317
And I don't like to think
what Thorin will do

728
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:24,818
when he finds out
what you've done.

729
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,153
I'm not afraid of Thorin.

730
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:27,588
Well, you should be.

731
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:31,491
Don't underestimate
the evil of gold.

732
01:05:31,493 --> 01:05:34,861
Gold over which a serpent
has long brooded.

733
01:05:34,863 --> 01:05:37,698
Dragon-sickness
seeps into the hearts

734
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,833
of all who come near
this mountain.

735
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:42,569
Almost all.

736
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,506
You there!

737
01:05:46,508 --> 01:05:47,741
Find this hobbit a bed...

738
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:50,877
And fill his belly
with hot food.

739
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:52,079
Hmm?

740
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:54,248
He's earned it.

741
01:05:55,517 --> 01:05:58,885
Hey. Keep an eye on him.

742
01:05:58,887 --> 01:06:03,257
If he should try to leave,
you tell me.

743
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,693
<font color="#ffff00">ALFRID</font>: Move it!

744
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:08,462
Stupid hobbit.

745
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:45,465
Wakey-wakey, hobbit,
up you... Get.

746
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:09,156
I will put the next one
between your eyes.

747
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,837
Ah! Oh!

748
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:37,117
We have come to tell you
payment of your debt

749
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:41,455
has been offered and accepted.

750
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,290
<font color="#ffff00">THORIN</font>: What payment?

751
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:45,859
I gave you nothing.

752
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:48,695
You have nothing.

753
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:57,104
We have<i> this.</i>

754
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:02,008
<font color="#ffff00">Kili</font>: They have the Arkenstone.

755
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:04,644
Thieves!

756
01:08:04,646 --> 01:08:08,248
How came you by the heirloom
of our house?!

757
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,017
That stone belongs to the king!

758
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:13,086
And the king may have it...

759
01:08:13,088 --> 01:08:16,390
With our goodwill.

760
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:24,564
But first
he must honor his word.

761
01:08:25,667 --> 01:08:28,668
They are taking us for fools.

762
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:31,738
This is a ruse.

763
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:35,275
A filthy lie.

764
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:38,412
The Arkenstone
is in this mountain!

765
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,280
It is a trick!

766
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:43,350
<font color="#ffff00">Bilbo</font>: I-it's no trick.

767
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:45,419
The stone is real.

768
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:47,921
I gave it to them.

769
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,130
You?

770
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:03,036
I took it as my 14th share.

771
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:05,472
You would steal from me?

772
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,107
Steal from you? No.

773
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:08,542
No, I may be a burglar,

774
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:11,545
but I like to think
I'm an honest one.

775
01:09:13,148 --> 01:09:15,449
I'm willing to let it stand
against my claim.

776
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:18,485
Against your claim?

777
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,054
Your claim.

778
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:25,125
You have no claim over me,
you miserable rat!

779
01:09:27,262 --> 01:09:29,429
I was going to give it to you.

780
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:32,933
Many times I wanted to, but...

781
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:35,335
But what, thief?

782
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,137
You are changed, Thorin.

783
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:38,905
The dwarf I met in bag end

784
01:09:38,907 --> 01:09:41,808
would never have gone back
on his word.

785
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:45,011
Would never have doubted
the loyalty of his kin!

786
01:09:45,013 --> 01:09:50,884
Do not speak to me of loyalty.

787
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:55,155
Throw him from the rampart!

788
01:10:04,132 --> 01:10:05,365
Did you not hear me?!

789
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,136
I will do it myself.

790
01:10:10,138 --> 01:10:12,339
- Curse you!
- No!

791
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:14,608
Cursed be the wizard that forced
you on this company!

792
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:17,210
Gandalf:
If you don't like my burglar,

793
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:19,446
then please don't damage him.

794
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:20,814
Return him to me.

795
01:10:24,953 --> 01:10:28,488
You're not making
a very splendid figure

796
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:31,625
as king under the mountain,
are you,

797
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:35,128
Thorin, son of thrain?

798
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:44,004
<font color="#ffff00">THORIN</font>: Never again will
I have dealings with wizards...

799
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:45,305
Go!

800
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:46,606
Or shire rats!

801
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:53,313
<font color="#ffff00">BARD</font>: Are we resolved?

802
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:57,284
The return of the Arkenstone
for what was promised?

803
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:10,964
Why should I buy back
that which is rightfully mine?

804
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:15,669
Keep the stone. Sell it.

805
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:19,372
Ecthelion of gondor will give
you a good price for it.

806
01:11:19,374 --> 01:11:20,607
I will kill you!

807
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,842
Upon my oath,
I will kill you all!

808
01:11:22,844 --> 01:11:24,945
Your oath means nothing!

809
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:28,915
I have heard enough.

810
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:40,060
Thorin, lay down your arms.

811
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:42,963
Open these doors.

812
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:46,733
This treasure will be
your death.

813
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:51,137
Sire, we cannot win this fight.

814
01:12:00,315 --> 01:12:02,782
<font color="#ffff00">Bard</font>: Give us your answer.

815
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,620
Will you have peace...

816
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:09,055
Or war?

817
01:12:20,068 --> 01:12:23,236
I will have war.

818
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,816
Ironfoot.

819
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:58,872
Ay! Thorin!

820
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:02,042
Ironfoot has come!

821
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:10,884
Who is that?
He doesn't look very happy.

822
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,953
It is dain,
lord of the iron hills.

823
01:13:13,955 --> 01:13:16,856
- Thorin's cousin.
- Are they alike?

824
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:22,395
I have always found Thorin
the more reasonable of the two.

825
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:33,139
Good morning.

826
01:13:33,141 --> 01:13:35,041
How are we all?

827
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,512
I have a wee proposition

828
01:13:39,514 --> 01:13:44,517
if you wouldn't mind giving me
a few moments of your time.

829
01:13:44,519 --> 01:13:47,921
Would ya consider...

830
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:50,423
Just sodding off?!

831
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:52,692
All of you!

832
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:54,494
Right now!

833
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:55,595
Stand fast.

834
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:59,365
Oh, come now, lord dain.

835
01:13:59,367 --> 01:14:01,401
Gandalf the grey.

836
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:05,205
Tell this rabble to leave

837
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:08,341
or I'll water the ground
with their blood!

838
01:14:11,546 --> 01:14:12,846
There is no need for war

839
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:15,782
between dwarves, men and elves.

840
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:18,852
A legion of orcs
march on the mountain.

841
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:20,253
Stand your army down.

842
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:23,022
I will not stand down
before any elf.

843
01:14:23,024 --> 01:14:26,793
Not least this faithless
woodland sprite.

844
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:31,397
He wishes nothing but ill
upon my people.

845
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:35,368
If he chooses to stand
between me and my kin

846
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:38,972
I'll split his pretty head open!

847
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:43,543
See if he's still smirking then.

848
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,212
Dain!

849
01:14:46,214 --> 01:14:48,548
Oi!

850
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,585
Oh.

851
01:14:52,587 --> 01:14:53,953
Let them advance.

852
01:14:53,955 --> 01:14:55,755
See how far they get.

853
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:58,892
Ya think I give a dead dog
for your threats,

854
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:01,227
you pointy-eared Princess?!

855
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,231
Ya hear that, lads? We're on!

856
01:15:05,233 --> 01:15:08,101
Let's give these bastards
a good hammering!

857
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:14,107
Stand your men down.

858
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:16,876
I'll deal with ironfoot
and his rabble.

859
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:23,650
Right, then.

860
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:25,752
Let's get this done.

861
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:28,354
Send in the goats!

862
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:47,173
Thranduil! This is madness!

863
01:16:09,297 --> 01:16:12,632
Hey! How do you like that,
you old twirly-whirlies?!

864
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,133
Ha ha, you buggers!

865
01:17:20,368 --> 01:17:22,502
Were-worms.

866
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:33,947
Oh, come on!

867
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:07,046
The hordes of hell are upon us!
Fight to the death!

868
01:18:17,792 --> 01:18:20,493
<font color="#ffff00">FILI</font>: I'm going over the wall.
Who's coming with me?

869
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:21,427
- <font color="#ffff00">OIN</font>: Aye!
- Yes!

870
01:18:21,429 --> 01:18:22,762
<font color="#ffff00">Dwalin</font>: Come on! Let's go!

871
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:24,464
- Stand down.
- What?

872
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:26,265
<font color="#ffff00">Fili</font>: Are we to do nothing?

873
01:18:26,267 --> 01:18:30,269
<font color="#ffff00">Thorin</font>: I said, stand down!

874
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,173
The elves.

875
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:36,342
Will they not fight?

876
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:36,369
<font color="#ffff00">BILBO</font>: Uh, Gandalf.

877
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:38,438
Is this a good place to stand?

878
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:04,157
Azog.

879
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,759
He's trying to cut us off.

880
01:21:10,798 --> 01:21:15,668
All of you!
Fall back to Dale! Now!

881
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:20,773
<font color="#ffff00">GANDALF</font>: To the city! Bilbo!

882
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:23,176
This way!

883
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:19,899
Ugh!

884
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:34,013
Sigrid!

885
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:35,915
Tilda!

886
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,027
My children!
Where are my children?!

887
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:49,195
I saw them!

888
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:51,197
They were down
in the old market!

889
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,032
The market?

890
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:54,700
Where are they now?!

891
01:22:54,702 --> 01:22:56,402
Tilda! Sigrid!

892
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:59,705
Bard! Orcs are storming
over the causeway!

893
01:22:59,707 --> 01:23:01,907
Get the bowmen
to the eastern parapet.

894
01:23:01,909 --> 01:23:03,876
Hold them off
for as long as you can.

895
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:05,611
Archers! This way!

896
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:08,281
The orcs have taken
stone street!

897
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:10,449
The market's overrun!

898
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:16,455
The rest of you, follow me!

01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:40,413
<font color="#ffff00">ALFRID</font>: Charge!

900
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:43,316
Onward! To the death!

901
01:24:14,882 --> 01:24:16,015
Da!

902
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:18,351
We're down here!

903
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:48,981
Bain! Sigrid! Get down!

904
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:39,865
Listen!

905
01:25:39,867 --> 01:25:42,535
I need you to gather the women
and children.

906
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:46,038
Take them to the great hall
and barricade the door.

907
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,473
You understand?

908
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:49,975
You must not come out
for any reason.

909
01:25:49,977 --> 01:25:51,410
We want to stay with you!

910
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:53,979
Show your father some respect!

911
01:25:53,981 --> 01:25:56,315
You leave it to me, sire.

912
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:57,716
You heard him.

913
01:25:57,718 --> 01:25:59,218
We make for the great hall.

914
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,053
Alfrid...

915
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:02,721
Women and children only.

916
01:26:02,723 --> 01:26:05,724
I need every man fighting.
See that you return.

917
01:26:05,726 --> 01:26:07,893
I'll get them to safety, sire.

918
01:26:09,997 --> 01:26:12,898
Then my sword is yours
to command.

919
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,166
Get up!

920
01:26:14,168 --> 01:26:16,802
- Look after them.
- All right.

921
01:26:18,973 --> 01:26:20,506
Shift it, granny!

922
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,054
Make for the great hall!

923
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:38,424
Out of my way!

924
01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:40,826
Abandon the cripples!

925
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:42,988
Ya buggers!

926
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:58,671
Where's Thorin?

927
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:00,739
We need him! Where is he?!

928
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:17,089
Fall back!

929
01:28:45,252 --> 01:28:49,054
Since when do we forsake
our own people?

930
01:28:49,056 --> 01:28:53,626
Thorin,
- they are dying out there.

931
01:28:58,132 --> 01:29:03,636
There are halls beneath halls
within this mountain.

932
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:06,772
Places we can fortify,

933
01:29:06,774 --> 01:29:09,274
shore up, make safe.

934
01:29:09,276 --> 01:29:11,410
Yes.

935
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:15,314
Yes, that is it.

936
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:18,984
We must move the gold further
underground to safety.

937
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:21,987
Did you not hear me?
Dain is surrounded.

938
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:24,723
They're being slaughtered,
Thorin.

939
01:29:26,594 --> 01:29:28,460
Many die in war.

940
01:29:28,462 --> 01:29:31,230
Life is cheap.

941
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,167
But a treasure such as this

942
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:39,071
cannot be counted in lives lost.

943
01:29:41,108 --> 01:29:45,878
It is worth all the blood
we can spend.

944
01:29:47,214 --> 01:29:52,951
You sit here in these vast halls
with a crown upon your head

945
01:29:52,953 --> 01:29:57,723
and yet you are lesser now
than you have ever been.

946
01:29:57,725 --> 01:30:01,193
Do not speak to me...

947
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:04,963
As if I were
some lowly dwarf lord,

948
01:30:04,965 --> 01:30:09,301
as if I were still...

949
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:16,675
Thorin Oakenshield.

950
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:19,645
I am your king!

951
01:30:19,647 --> 01:30:21,080
You were always my king.

952
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:23,982
You used to know that once.

953
01:30:23,984 --> 01:30:28,887
You cannot see
what you have become.

954
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:32,091
Go.

955
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:36,061
Get out.

956
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:41,166
Before I kill you.

957
01:30:54,281 --> 01:30:59,017
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: <i>You sit here

959
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:03,789
Thorin:

961

<font color="#ffff00">BARD</font>: <i>A sickness lies upon

962
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:10,729

963
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:12,097
<font color="#ffff00">Thorin</font>: <i>Am I not the king?!</i>

964
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:14,767

965
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:17,035
<i>And ours alone.</i>

966
01:31:17,037 --> 01:31:20,873
<i>I will not part...</i>

967
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:24,042
<i>With a s-s-s-s-single coin.</i>

968
01:31:24,044 --> 01:31:26,044
<font color="#ffff00">BARD</font>: <i>He could not see
beyond his own desire!</i>

Gandalf:

983

01:32:42,122 --> 01:32:43,355
Aah!

989
01:32:46,126 --> 01:32:48,527
Aah!

990
01:33:04,345 --> 01:33:06,044
Fall back!

991
01:33:06,046 --> 01:33:09,581
Fall back! To the mountain!

992
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:14,052
Fall back!

993
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:59,298
I will not hide
behind a wall of stone

994
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:03,035
while others fight
our battles for us!

995
01:34:06,206 --> 01:34:10,208
It is not in my blood, Thorin.

996
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:15,047
No.

997
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:17,983
It is not.

998
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:21,053
We are sons of Durin.

999
01:34:23,057 --> 01:34:29,494
And Durin's folk do not flee
from a fight.

1000
01:34:51,418 --> 01:34:56,355
I have no right to ask this
of any of you.

1001
01:35:00,094 --> 01:35:03,595
But will you follow me...

1002
01:35:03,597 --> 01:35:06,365
One last time?

1003
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:48,573
Thorin.

1004
01:35:50,811 --> 01:35:52,611
Thorin.

1005
01:36:17,604 --> 01:36:21,740
<font color="#ffff00">DAIN</font>: To the king!

1006
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:25,177

1007
01:36:25,179 --> 01:36:30,182
D'abakkur!

1008
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:48,700
The dwarves.

1009
01:36:48,702 --> 01:36:50,769
They're rallying.

1010
01:36:53,207 --> 01:36:57,275
They're rallying to their king.

1011
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:14,926
Any man who wants to give
their last, follow me!

1012
01:37:23,003 --> 01:37:25,737
Come on, Bombur! Get up!

1013
01:37:41,588 --> 01:37:42,654
Huh?

1014
01:38:02,943 --> 01:38:03,975
Nori!

1015
01:38:03,977 --> 01:38:06,678
Dori! Right behind you, brother!

1016
01:38:48,722 --> 01:38:52,824
I say we stand with our men
in life and in death.

1017
01:38:52,826 --> 01:38:53,925
I'm with you.

1018
01:38:53,927 --> 01:38:55,260
Arm yourselves.

1019
01:38:55,262 --> 01:38:57,495
Come with us, love. No, no, no.

1020
01:38:57,497 --> 01:38:59,197
You leave an old woman be.

1021
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:00,332
Don't be afraid.

1022
01:39:00,334 --> 01:39:03,101
<font color="#ffff00">Alfrid</font>: I said, get off!

1023
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:05,237
Alfrid lickspittle.

1024
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:07,572
- You are a coward.
- "Coward"?

1025
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:10,709
Not every man's brave enough
to wear a corset.

1026
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:11,843
You're not a man.

1027
01:39:11,845 --> 01:39:13,511
You're a weasel.

1028
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:46,778
Dain!

1029
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:48,446
Thorin!

1030
01:39:48,448 --> 01:39:51,316
Hold on! I'm coming!

1031
01:39:59,059 --> 01:40:01,493
Hey, cousin!

1032
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:03,128
What took you so long?

1033
01:40:03,130 --> 01:40:06,564
Ah.

1034
01:40:06,566 --> 01:40:10,068
There's too many of
these buggers, Thorin.

1035
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:12,237
I hope you've got a plan.

1036
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:15,407
Aye.

1037
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:17,575
We're going to take out
their leader.

1038
01:40:17,577 --> 01:40:19,511
Azog.

1039
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:25,517
I'm gonna kill
that piece of filth.

1040
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:27,452
Thorin, you cannot do this.

1041
01:40:27,454 --> 01:40:28,753
You're our king.

1042
01:40:28,755 --> 01:40:31,022
That is why I must do it.

1043
01:40:31,024 --> 01:40:34,125
And how do you plan
to fight your way

1044
01:40:34,127 --> 01:40:36,361
single-handed to ravenhill?

1045
01:40:43,804 --> 01:40:45,804
It's been a while
since I've done this.

1046
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:49,307
On! To ravenhill!

1047
01:40:49,309 --> 01:40:50,942
Hold tight, lads!

1048
01:40:50,944 --> 01:40:53,445
You're all mad bastards!

1049
01:40:53,447 --> 01:40:56,348
You might make it.

1050
01:40:57,284 --> 01:41:00,618
May Durin save you all.

1051
01:41:41,495 --> 01:41:43,595
Watch out!

1052
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:53,138
Eyes front, lads!

1053
01:42:01,415 --> 01:42:03,748
Hold on!

1054
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:05,817
Aaah!

1055
01:42:09,856 --> 01:42:11,756
I'm out!

1056
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:23,101
Bring it down! Shoot it!

1057
01:42:23,103 --> 01:42:24,235
Where?

1058
01:42:24,237 --> 01:42:26,271
Aim at its jambags!

1059
01:42:26,273 --> 01:42:28,640
It doesn't have any jambags!

1060
01:42:31,878 --> 01:42:34,412
Move it!

1061
01:42:34,414 --> 01:42:36,948
<font color="#ffff00">BOFUR</font>: Hang on, lads!
I'm coming!

1062
01:42:48,228 --> 01:42:51,129
Bofur, you beauty!

1063
01:42:57,471 --> 01:43:00,138
- Dwalin!
- Keep going!

1064
01:43:03,643 --> 01:43:07,245
Come on, you hairy hedgepig!

1065
01:43:07,247 --> 01:43:09,147
Come on!

1066
01:43:17,157 --> 01:43:18,656
Wargs!

1067
01:43:28,535 --> 01:43:29,934
Hyah!

1068
01:43:34,207 --> 01:43:36,207
Ohh!

1069
01:43:50,357 --> 01:43:52,190
There's more coming!

1070
01:43:55,829 --> 01:43:57,662
We're pulling too much weight.

1071
01:43:57,664 --> 01:43:59,330
We won't make it.

1072
01:43:59,332 --> 01:44:00,698
Cut the tracers.

1073
01:44:01,801 --> 01:44:04,068
Ride them to ravenhill.

1074
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:06,104
No, balin.

1075
01:44:07,474 --> 01:44:10,108
My goat-riding days are over.

1076
01:44:11,811 --> 01:44:13,878
Durin be with you.

1077
01:44:41,775 --> 01:44:45,310
I am too old for this!

1078
01:44:46,413 --> 01:44:48,846
Hyah! Onward!

1079
01:44:48,848 --> 01:44:51,749
Lead on!

1080
01:45:22,048 --> 01:45:23,381
Get up.

1081
01:45:23,383 --> 01:45:25,650
Get away from me.

1082
01:45:25,652 --> 01:45:27,452
I don't take orders from you.

1083
01:45:27,454 --> 01:45:28,553
People trusted you.

1084
01:45:28,555 --> 01:45:29,954
They listened to you.

1085
01:45:29,956 --> 01:45:32,957
The master's mantle
was there for the taking.

1086
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:36,294
And you threw it all away.

1087
01:45:36,296 --> 01:45:38,630
Boom.

1088
01:45:46,339 --> 01:45:47,772
Alfrid...

1089
01:45:47,774 --> 01:45:49,807
Your slip is showing.

1090
01:46:33,687 --> 01:46:36,020
Oh!

1091
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:39,857
Aaah!

1092
01:46:59,145 --> 01:47:00,411
Aaaah!

1093
01:47:18,498 --> 01:47:21,432
We may yet survive this.

1094
01:47:21,434 --> 01:47:23,601
Gandalf!

1095
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:25,303
Ugh!

1096
01:47:31,377 --> 01:47:32,343
It's Thorin!

1097
01:47:32,345 --> 01:47:34,412
And fili, kili

1098
01:47:34,414 --> 01:47:37,048
and Dwalin.

1099
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:39,450
He's taking his best warriors.

1100
01:47:39,452 --> 01:47:40,852
To do what?

1101
01:47:40,854 --> 01:47:44,789
To cut the head off the snake.

1102
01:48:16,723 --> 01:48:18,890
Die!

1103
01:48:25,665 --> 01:48:27,398
Gandalf!

1104
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:29,333
Legolas.

1105
01:48:30,603 --> 01:48:31,736
Legolas Greenleaf.

1106
01:48:31,738 --> 01:48:32,970
There is a second army.

1107
01:48:32,972 --> 01:48:35,306
Bolg leads a force
of gundabad orcs.

1108
01:48:35,308 --> 01:48:36,641
They are almost upon us.

1109
01:48:36,643 --> 01:48:38,676
Gundabad.

1110
01:48:38,678 --> 01:48:41,379
This was their plan all along.

1111
01:48:42,816 --> 01:48:44,482
Azog engages our forces,

1112
01:48:44,484 --> 01:48:47,485
then bolg sweeps in
from the north.

1113
01:48:47,487 --> 01:48:48,986
Wha... th-the north?

1114
01:48:48,988 --> 01:48:51,322
Where is the north exactly?

1115
01:48:51,324 --> 01:48:52,924
Ravenhill.

1116
01:48:52,926 --> 01:48:55,326
Ravenhill?

1117
01:48:55,328 --> 01:48:57,094
Thorin is up there.

1118
01:48:57,096 --> 01:48:59,430
And fili and kili.
They're all up there.

1119
01:49:14,814 --> 01:49:18,015
<font color="#ffff00">KILI</font>: Where is he?

1120
01:49:21,621 --> 01:49:24,555
It looks empty.

1121
01:49:24,557 --> 01:49:27,024
I think Azog has fled.

1122
01:49:27,026 --> 01:49:29,527
I don't think so.

1123
01:49:31,464 --> 01:49:35,967
Fili, take your brother.

1124
01:49:35,969 --> 01:49:37,535
Scout out the towers.

1125
01:49:37,537 --> 01:49:40,037
Keep low and out of sight.

1126
01:49:40,039 --> 01:49:42,039
If you see something,
report back.

1127
01:49:42,041 --> 01:49:44,008
Do not engage.
Do you understand?

1128
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:45,643
We have company.

1129
01:49:45,645 --> 01:49:47,879
Goblin mercenaries.

1130
01:49:47,881 --> 01:49:49,313
No more than a hundred.

1131
01:49:49,315 --> 01:49:51,482
We'll take care of them. Go!

1132
01:49:51,484 --> 01:49:53,484
Go!

1133
01:49:53,486 --> 01:49:55,720
Come on!

1134
01:49:57,357 --> 01:49:59,991
Die!

1135
01:50:22,882 --> 01:50:25,683
Recall your company.

1136
01:50:31,357 --> 01:50:32,456
My lord!

1137
01:50:32,458 --> 01:50:34,525
Dispatch this force
to ravenhill.

1138
01:50:34,527 --> 01:50:36,694
The dwarves are
about to be overrun.

1139
01:50:36,696 --> 01:50:37,762
Thorin must be warned.

1140
01:50:37,764 --> 01:50:40,197
By all means, warn him.

1141
01:50:40,199 --> 01:50:41,933
I have spent enough elvish blood

1142
01:50:41,935 --> 01:50:43,768
in defense of
this accursed land.

1143
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:46,370
- No more.
- Thranduil?

1144
01:50:46,372 --> 01:50:47,872
I'll go.

1145
01:50:47,874 --> 01:50:50,107
Don't be ridiculous.

1146
01:50:50,109 --> 01:50:52,576
- You'll never make it.
- Why not?

1147
01:50:52,578 --> 01:50:56,113
Because they will see you coming
and kill you.

1148
01:50:56,115 --> 01:50:58,482
No, they won't.

1149
01:50:58,484 --> 01:51:00,885
They won't see me.

1150
01:51:00,887 --> 01:51:03,988
It's out of the question.

1151
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:05,923
I won't allow it.

1152
01:51:05,925 --> 01:51:09,994
I'm not asking you
to allow it, Gandalf.

1153
01:51:47,834 --> 01:51:50,601
You will not turn away.

1154
01:51:50,603 --> 01:51:51,936
Not this time.

1155
01:51:51,938 --> 01:51:54,805
Get out of my way.

1156
01:51:54,807 --> 01:51:56,674
The dwarves will be slaughtered.

1157
01:51:56,676 --> 01:51:58,943
Yes, they will die.

1158
01:51:58,945 --> 01:52:02,680
Today, tomorrow,

1159
01:52:02,682 --> 01:52:05,683
one year hence,
a hundred years from now.

1160
01:52:05,685 --> 01:52:07,852
What does it matter?

1161
01:52:07,854 --> 01:52:09,620
They are mortal.

1162
01:52:11,691 --> 01:52:14,492
You think your life is worth
more than theirs

1163
01:52:14,494 --> 01:52:17,862
when there is no love in it?

1164
01:52:17,864 --> 01:52:22,033
There is no love in you.

1165
01:52:27,006 --> 01:52:29,473
What do you know of love?

1166
01:52:29,475 --> 01:52:31,308
Nothing.

1167
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:34,412
What you feel for that dwarf
is not real.

1168
01:52:36,315 --> 01:52:40,684
You think it is love?
Are you ready to die for it?

1169
01:52:53,766 --> 01:52:55,766
I will go with you.

1170
01:53:04,043 --> 01:53:06,310
Aaaah!

1171
01:53:18,691 --> 01:53:20,758
Pull!

1172
01:53:34,540 --> 01:53:37,975
Bifur, you've lost your ax.

1173
01:53:37,977 --> 01:53:39,543
Aah!

1174
01:53:39,545 --> 01:53:40,945
No, he's not.

1175
01:53:40,947 --> 01:53:42,780
Here you go, cousin.

1176
01:53:43,749 --> 01:53:47,218
You know where
you can stick that.

1177
01:53:58,231 --> 01:54:01,599
Stay here.
Search the lower levels.

1178
01:54:01,601 --> 01:54:04,201
I've got this.

1179
01:54:11,844 --> 01:54:15,312
Where is that orc filth?

1180
01:54:16,949 --> 01:54:18,516
Thorin.

1181
01:54:18,518 --> 01:54:19,650
Bilbo.

1182
01:54:19,652 --> 01:54:21,619
You have to leave here. Now.

1183
01:54:21,621 --> 01:54:23,754
Azog has another army
attacking from the north.

1184
01:54:23,756 --> 01:54:25,856
This watchtower will be
completely surrounded.

1185
01:54:25,858 --> 01:54:27,258
There'll be no way out.

1186
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:29,293
- We are so close.
- That orc scum is in there.

1187
01:54:29,295 --> 01:54:32,863
I say we push on.
No! That's what he wants.

1188
01:54:32,865 --> 01:54:35,399
He wants to draw us in.

1189
01:54:36,769 --> 01:54:37,868
This is a trap.

1190
01:54:53,786 --> 01:54:55,653
Find fili and kili.
Call them back.

1191
01:54:55,655 --> 01:54:57,655
Thorin,
- are you sure about this?

1192
01:54:57,657 --> 01:54:59,790
Do it.

1193
01:54:59,792 --> 01:55:02,693
We'll live to fight another day.

1194
01:55:24,584 --> 01:55:25,916
Oh.

1195
01:55:36,662 --> 01:55:39,230
Go!

1196
01:55:43,502 --> 01:55:44,702
Run!

1197
01:55:44,704 --> 01:55:45,769
Ugh!

1198
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:16,433
Kili!

1199
01:56:16,435 --> 01:56:18,936
<font color="#ffff00">DWALIN</font>: Thorin!

1200
01:56:18,938 --> 01:56:22,439
Thorin. No!

1201
01:57:44,990 --> 01:57:46,390
No.

1202
01:58:02,541 --> 01:58:04,575
<font color="#ffff00">TAURIEL</font>: Kili.

1203
01:59:17,416 --> 01:59:19,883
Ugh!

1204
02:00:12,938 --> 02:00:14,838
Kili!

1205
02:00:19,378 --> 02:00:20,844
Kili!

1206
02:00:20,846 --> 02:00:22,946
Tauriel!

1207
02:00:22,948 --> 02:00:24,314
Kili.

1208
02:00:26,118 --> 02:00:28,018
Ugh!

1209
02:01:29,281 --> 02:01:30,414
No!

1210
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:42,125
No!

1211
02:07:19,598 --> 02:07:22,132
Tauriel!

1212
02:09:04,469 --> 02:09:05,735
Aah!

1213
02:10:31,556 --> 02:10:34,424
Aah!

1214
02:10:34,426 --> 02:10:36,459
Aah!

1215
02:12:14,926 --> 02:12:17,727
The eagles are coming.

1216
02:13:07,879 --> 02:13:08,711
Bilbo!

1217
02:13:08,713 --> 02:13:10,046
Don't move. Don't move.

1218
02:13:10,048 --> 02:13:11,080
Lie still.

1219
02:13:11,082 --> 02:13:14,951
Oh. Mnh. Mnh.

1220
02:13:14,953 --> 02:13:16,286
I'm glad you are here.

1221
02:13:16,288 --> 02:13:18,454
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

1222
02:13:18,456 --> 02:13:22,392
- I wish to part from you in friendship.
- No.

1223
02:13:22,394 --> 02:13:24,060
You are not going anywhere,
Thorin.

1224
02:13:24,062 --> 02:13:25,895
You're going to live.

1225
02:13:25,897 --> 02:13:30,833
I would take back my words
and my deeds at the gate.

1226
02:13:30,835 --> 02:13:34,737
You did what only a true friend
would do.

1227
02:13:34,739 --> 02:13:36,572
Forgive me.

1228
02:13:38,143 --> 02:13:42,578
I was too blind to see it.

1229
02:13:42,580 --> 02:13:44,981
I am so sorry

1230
02:13:44,983 --> 02:13:47,750
that I have led you
into such peril.

1231
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:52,255
No, I'm... I'm glad to have
shared in your perils, Thorin.

1232
02:13:52,257 --> 02:13:53,990
Each and every one of them.

1233
02:13:55,960 --> 02:14:00,396
- It is far more.
- Than any Baggins deserves.

1234
02:14:04,102 --> 02:14:05,835
Farewell...

1235
02:14:05,837 --> 02:14:09,172
Master burglar.

1236
02:14:09,174 --> 02:14:12,342
Go back to your books.

1237
02:14:12,344 --> 02:14:15,945
And your armchair.

1238
02:14:15,947 --> 02:14:19,282
Plant your trees.

1239
02:14:19,284 --> 02:14:22,051
Watch them grow.

1240
02:14:24,222 --> 02:14:28,324
If more people...

1241
02:14:28,326 --> 02:14:33,363
Valued home above gold...

1242
02:14:33,365 --> 02:14:38,534
This world would be
a merrier place.

1243
02:14:40,839 --> 02:14:43,473
No. No, no, no, no. No.

1244
02:14:43,475 --> 02:14:46,008
Thorin. Thorin, don't you dare.

1245
02:14:48,079 --> 02:14:49,712
Thorin.

1246
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:57,553
Thorin. Thorin. Hold on.

1247
02:14:57,555 --> 02:14:59,355
Hold on, please.

1248
02:14:59,357 --> 02:15:01,157
The eagles...

1249
02:15:01,159 --> 02:15:04,026
The eagles...
The eagles are here.

1250
02:15:04,028 --> 02:15:05,728
Thorin?

1251
02:15:08,166 --> 02:15:11,067
The ea...

1252
02:16:05,957 --> 02:16:10,059
I...Cannot go back.

1253
02:16:10,061 --> 02:16:11,661
Where will you go?

1254
02:16:13,398 --> 02:16:15,398
I do not know.

1255
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:18,167
Go north.

1256
02:16:18,169 --> 02:16:20,603
Find the dúnedain.

1257
02:16:20,605 --> 02:16:23,306
There's a young ranger
amongst them.

1258
02:16:23,308 --> 02:16:24,674
You should meet him.

1259
02:16:24,676 --> 02:16:28,744
His father, arathorn,
was a good man.

1260
02:16:28,746 --> 02:16:34,150
His son might grow
to be a great one.

1261
02:16:35,954 --> 02:16:37,753
What is his name?

1262
02:16:37,755 --> 02:16:41,591
He's known in the wild
as strider.

1263
02:16:41,593 --> 02:16:46,662
His true name you must discover
for yourself.

1264
02:16:49,501 --> 02:16:52,335
Legolas.

1265
02:16:52,337 --> 02:16:56,439
Your mother loved you.

1266
02:16:56,441 --> 02:16:59,141
More than anyone.

1267
02:16:59,143 --> 02:17:01,577
More than life.

1268
02:17:35,813 --> 02:17:39,315
They want to bury him.

1269
02:17:39,317 --> 02:17:42,818
Yes.

1270
02:17:42,820 --> 02:17:47,089
If this is love,
I do not want it.

1271
02:17:49,661 --> 02:17:52,161
Take it from me.

1272
02:17:52,163 --> 02:17:54,897
Please.

1273
02:17:58,336 --> 02:18:02,371
Why does it hurt so much?

1274
02:18:02,373 --> 02:18:06,142
Because it was real.

1275
02:19:31,029 --> 02:19:34,397
Mm.

1276
02:22:12,924 --> 02:22:16,692
<font color="#ffff00">Gandalf</font>: The king is dead.

1277
02:22:16,694 --> 02:22:19,929
Long live the king!

1278
02:22:19,931 --> 02:22:21,831
<font color="#ffff00">All</font>: Long live the king!

1279
02:22:30,441 --> 02:22:32,708
There is to be
a great feast tonight.

1280
02:22:32,710 --> 02:22:34,343
Songs will be sung.

1281
02:22:34,345 --> 02:22:37,112
Tales will be told.

1282
02:22:37,114 --> 02:22:39,114
And Thorin Oakenshield

1283
02:22:39,116 --> 02:22:42,184
will pass into legend.

1284
02:22:42,186 --> 02:22:44,386
I know that's how
you must honor him.

1285
02:22:44,388 --> 02:22:46,956
But to me, he was never that.

1286
02:22:46,958 --> 02:22:49,291
He was...

1287
02:22:49,293 --> 02:22:53,462
To me...

1288
02:22:53,464 --> 02:22:54,864
He was...

1289
02:23:01,005 --> 02:23:02,905
Well, I think
I'll slip quietly away.

1290
02:23:02,907 --> 02:23:04,907
Will you tell the others
I said goodbye?

1291
02:23:04,909 --> 02:23:07,376
You can tell them yourself.

1292
02:23:22,193 --> 02:23:25,594
Uh, if any of you are ever
passing bag end,

1293
02:23:25,596 --> 02:23:27,096
uh...

1294
02:23:30,868 --> 02:23:33,002
tea is at 4:00.

1295
02:23:33,004 --> 02:23:37,172
There's plenty of it.

1296
02:23:37,174 --> 02:23:41,010
You are welcome anytime.

1297
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:48,684
Uh...

1298
02:23:48,686 --> 02:23:51,020
Don't bother knocking.

1299
02:24:33,230 --> 02:24:37,399
- Ah.
- The borders of the shire.

1300
02:24:37,401 --> 02:24:40,069
It is here I must leave you.

1301
02:24:41,973 --> 02:24:44,373
That's a shame.

1302
02:24:46,010 --> 02:24:50,079
I quite like
having a wizard around.

1303
02:24:50,081 --> 02:24:53,182
Seems they bring good luck.

1304
02:24:53,184 --> 02:24:55,417
You don't really suppose,
do you,

1305
02:24:55,419 --> 02:24:57,252
that all your adventures
and escapes

1306
02:24:57,254 --> 02:24:59,488
were managed by mere luck?

1307
02:24:59,490 --> 02:25:02,591
Magic rings should not be used
lightly, bilbo.

1308
02:25:02,593 --> 02:25:05,361
Don't take me for a fool.

1309
02:25:05,363 --> 02:25:07,763
- I know you found one...
- No, no...

1310
02:25:07,765 --> 02:25:09,264
in the goblin tunnels.

1311
02:25:09,266 --> 02:25:12,701
And I've kept my eye on you
ever since.

1312
02:25:14,672 --> 02:25:16,505
Well, thank goodness.

1313
02:25:20,478 --> 02:25:23,679
Farewell, Gandalf.

1314
02:25:25,549 --> 02:25:27,216
Farewell.

1315
02:25:34,058 --> 02:25:36,625
You, uh... needn't worry
about that ring.

1316
02:25:36,627 --> 02:25:39,528
It fell out of
my pocket during the battle.

1317
02:25:39,530 --> 02:25:40,629
I lost it.

1318
02:25:40,631 --> 02:25:45,234
You are a very fine person,
Mr. Baggins.

1319
02:25:45,236 --> 02:25:49,238
And I'm very fond of you.

1320
02:25:49,240 --> 02:25:52,808
But you're only
quite a little fellow

1321
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:56,612
in a wide world after all.

1322
02:26:26,744 --> 02:26:30,512
Wait a minute,
- that's my mother's glory box.

1323
02:26:30,514 --> 02:26:33,182
And that's my dining chair.

1324
02:26:33,184 --> 02:26:35,851
Ah! Put that pouf down!

1325
02:26:35,853 --> 02:26:38,020
What is going on?

1326
02:26:38,022 --> 02:26:40,122
Hello, Mr. bilbo.

1327
02:26:40,124 --> 02:26:42,724
You're not supposed to be here.

1328
02:26:42,726 --> 02:26:44,426
What do you mean?

1329
02:26:44,428 --> 02:26:46,528
- On account of you.
- Being presumed dead and all.

1330
02:26:46,530 --> 02:26:48,697
I am not dead.

1331
02:26:48,699 --> 02:26:51,400
Presumed or otherwise.

1332
02:26:51,402 --> 02:26:53,802
I'm not sure that's permitted.

1333
02:26:53,804 --> 02:26:55,904
Mr. bilbo!

1334
02:26:55,906 --> 02:26:57,206
<font color="#ffff00">TOSSER GRUBB</font>: 21!

1335
02:26:57,208 --> 02:27:00,375
Any advance on 21?
Any advance on 21?

1336
02:27:00,377 --> 02:27:03,278
Sold to Mrs. bolger.

1337
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:05,714
Somewhere for fatty
to put his feet on.

1338
02:27:07,885 --> 02:27:11,753
So do I have any bids for this?
This is shire-made.

1339
02:27:11,755 --> 02:27:13,489
None of your dwarvish
reproductions here.

1340
02:27:13,491 --> 02:27:15,224
<font color="#ffff00">Our next... BILBO</font>: Stop!

1341
02:27:15,226 --> 02:27:17,659
Stop! There's been a mistake!

1342
02:27:17,661 --> 02:27:20,229
Who are you? What do
you mean, who am I?

1343
02:27:20,231 --> 02:27:21,997
You know perfectly well
who I am,

1344
02:27:21,999 --> 02:27:24,066
lobelia sackville-Baggins.

1345
02:27:24,068 --> 02:27:25,567
This is my home!

1346
02:27:25,569 --> 02:27:27,936
And those are my spoons.
Thank you very much.

1347
02:27:27,938 --> 02:27:30,939
Tosser grubb: This is most irregular.
Excuse me.

1348
02:27:30,941 --> 02:27:34,009
It's been more than 13 months
since the disappearance.

1349
02:27:34,011 --> 02:27:36,945
If you are in fact
bilbo Baggins,

1350
02:27:36,947 --> 02:27:40,749
and undeceased,
can you prove it?

1351
02:27:40,751 --> 02:27:41,783
What?!

1352
02:27:41,785 --> 02:27:43,018
Well, something official

1353
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:45,020
with your name on it
would suffice.

1354
02:27:45,022 --> 02:27:47,422
All right. Right.

1355
02:27:49,160 --> 02:27:54,129
A contract of employment
as a... a b...

1356
02:27:54,131 --> 02:27:55,931
Never mind as what.

1357
02:27:55,933 --> 02:27:59,001
There. My signature.

1358
02:27:59,003 --> 02:28:00,936
Yes, well...

1359
02:28:00,938 --> 02:28:03,539
Uh, well, it certainly
seems to be in order.

1360
02:28:03,541 --> 02:28:05,007
Yes.

1361
02:28:05,009 --> 02:28:07,209
Seems there can be no doubt.

1362
02:28:07,211 --> 02:28:10,112
Who is this person you pledged
your service to?

1363
02:28:10,114 --> 02:28:13,782
Thorin Oakenshield?

1364
02:28:16,220 --> 02:28:20,689
He... he was my friend.

1365
02:30:15,406 --> 02:30:17,139
No, thank you!

1366
02:30:17,141 --> 02:30:18,807
We don't want any more visitors,

1367
02:30:18,809 --> 02:30:21,977
well-wishers
or distant relations!

1368
02:30:21,979 --> 02:30:26,882
<font color="#ffff00">GANDALF</font>: And what about
very old friends?

Bilbo Baggins.

1371
02:30:35,426 --> 02:30:37,926
My dear Gandalf!

1372
02:30:37,928 --> 02:30:39,094
It's good to see you.

111 years old.

1374
02:30:41,598 --> 02:30:43,932
Who would believe it?

1375
02:30:46,203 --> 02:30:48,770
Come on, come in!

1376
02:30:48,772 --> 02:30:51,773
Welcome. Welcome.
