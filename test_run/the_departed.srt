2
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,310
I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.

3
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,124
I want my environment
to be a product of me.

4
00:00:51,328 --> 00:00:53,592
Years ago, we had the Church.

5
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:58,393
That was only a way of
saying we had each other.

6
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,933
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

7
00:01:03,107 --> 00:01:05,302
It put hate in your heart.

8
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:08,874
The Knights of Columbus
were real head-breakers.

9
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:10,274
True guineas.

10
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:12,973
They took over their
piece of the city.

11
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:19,549
Twenty years after an Irishman
couldn't get a fucking job...

12
00:01:19,723 --> 00:01:23,853
we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.

13
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:27,328
That's what the niggers
don't realise.

14
00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:31,764
If I got one thing against the
black chappies, it's this:

15
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:34,063
No one gives it to you.

16
00:01:34,238 --> 00:01:36,138
You have to take it.

17
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:01,361
Vin, don't make me have to
come down here again for this.

18
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:04,023
Won't happen again, Mr C.

19
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:10,469
Carmen's developing
into a fine young lady.

20
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:12,734
You should be proud.

21
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:28,114
You get your period yet, Carmen?

22
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,242
You Johnny Sullivan's kid?

23
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:51,410
-You live with your grandmother?
-Yeah.

24
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:53,644
Vin, get him a couple loaves of

25
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:55,947
bread, couple
half-gallons of milk.

26
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,680
Do you like Bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

27
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:03,418
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

28
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:07,287
You do good in school?

29
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:12,435
-Yeah.
-That's good. I did too.

30
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:15,197
They call that a paradox.

31
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,306
Just keep it. Buy
yourself some make-up.

32
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:30,078
You ever wanna earn a little extra
money, you come by L Street.

33
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:32,950
You know where I am on L Street?

34
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:34,750
Good.

35
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:37,450
-Good boy.
-Thanks.

36
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:43,394
To you, O Lord, we commend the
soul of Alphonsus, your servant.

37
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:45,558
In the sight of this
world, he is now dead.

38
00:03:45,736 --> 00:03:48,638
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

39
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,639
Amen.

40
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,337
The Church wants
you in your place.

41
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:54,068
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

42
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:57,737
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

43
00:03:57,915 --> 00:04:00,076
A man makes his own way.

44
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:01,843
No one gives it to you.

45
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:03,884
You have to take it. Non seveium.

46
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:08,323
-James Joyce.
-Smart, Colin.

47
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:10,957
Guineas from the North
End, down Providence...

48
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:13,824
tried to tell me what to do.

49
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:17,764
And, uh...something maybe
happened to them.

50
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:21,936
Maybe...uh like that.

51
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,440
Jeez. She fell funny.

52
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:37,852
Francis, you really
should see somebody.

53
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:41,321
When you decide to be
something, you can be it.

54
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,757
That's what they don't
tell you in Church.

55
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:47,224
When I was your
age, they would say

56
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:49,456
we could become cops or criminals.

57
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:52,397
Today what I'm saying
to you is this:

58
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:56,130
When you're facing a loaded gun...

59
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:00,272
what's the difference?

60
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:05,245
Hmm? That's my boy.

61
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:08,547
Terminal ballistics is the
study of a projectile...

62
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:11,415
as it hits a target and the
destruction that it causes.

63
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:14,682
Take, for instance, what
you carry, 9 hollow-point.

64
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:16,459
When the hollow-point hits the

65
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,487
skull, what happens
is it mushrooms.

66
00:05:18,662 --> 00:05:21,529
When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...

67
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:24,862
ten little particles of the bullet
that are like razor blades...

68
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:26,161
Sir, yes, sir! Sir, yes sir!

69
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:28,148
Tearing their internal
organs, their

70
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:29,773
liver, their lungs, their heart...

71
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,672
bringing tissue,
bone, blood, brain

72
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:33,501
matter, and that's
called a blowback.

73
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:43,576
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

74
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:45,603
Firemen getting
pussy for the first

75
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:47,554
time in the history
of fire or pussy.

76
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:51,422
Hey, go save a kitten in a
tree, you fucking homos.

77
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:54,386
Pencils.

78
00:06:00,204 --> 00:06:01,432
Begin.

79
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:11,170
What are you looking at?

80
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:15,384
Forget it.

81
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:19,181
Your father was a janitor,
his son's only a cop.

82
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:25,460
Those fucking firefighters
are a bunch of homos.

83
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:27,424
They are.

84
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:29,144
So she tells me, You never finish

85
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:31,159
anything. You finish
the police course...

86
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:33,951
you get taken care
of again, baby. So

87
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:36,773
after graduation, I
get a blowjob again.

88
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,773
That's great, your mother
must be a wonderful woman.

89
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:40,967
Go fuck yourself.

90
00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:43,511
Put it this way. You're
a black guy in Boston.

91
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,240
You don't need any help from
me to be completely fucked.

92
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:49,682
The Massachusetts State Police has
a long tradition of excellence.

93
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,353
Your graduation today
solidifies your acceptance...

94
00:06:53,524 --> 00:06:54,801
into one of the finest law

95
00:06:54,802 --> 00:06:56,618
enforcement agencies
in our nation.

96
00:06:56,794 --> 00:06:58,677
As the governor of
the Commonwealth

97
00:06:58,678 --> 00:07:00,560
of Massachusetts,
I am confident...

98
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:03,311
each and every one
of you will serve

99
00:07:03,312 --> 00:07:06,101
with distinction,
honour and integrity.

100
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,204
Congratulations to all
our new troopers.

101
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:11,466
Thank you. You are dismissed.

102
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:24,036
Sullivan! Assigned to
plain-clothes right

103
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:25,681
out of the gate, congratulations.

104
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:27,910
We're gonna go out for a
beer. You wanna come?

105
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:29,622
No, no, I'll catch up with you guys.

106
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:40,561
School's out.

107
00:07:42,306 --> 00:07:44,274
Thank you, Frank.

108
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,065
You earned it.

109
00:07:46,243 --> 00:07:49,303
No more pencils, no more books.

110
00:07:52,015 --> 00:07:53,015
Alright.

111
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:54,707
This is not the regular police...

112
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:56,785
-this is the state police.
-And fire.

113
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:59,080
Your training will
illustrate the difference.

114
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:01,952
State police, search warrant.
State police, open the door.

115
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,490
What's the difference?

116
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,060
-Go, go, go!
-Sir, yes, sir!

117
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,290
-Is that understood?!
-Sir, yes, sir!

118
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:12,629
Move it, get the fuck down right
now! Get down, right now!

119
00:08:23,647 --> 00:08:26,548
Congratulations on passing the
detective's exam, and welcome...

120
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:28,870
to the Special Investigation Unit.

121
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:30,209
Whoop-de-fucking-do.

122
00:08:30,854 --> 00:08:33,254
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

123
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:35,058
You'll be working for Captain

124
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,257
Ellerby, but I like
to see everybody.

125
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:41,926
You're a worker. You rise fast.

126
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,090
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

127
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:48,297
-Thank you, sergeant.
-My pleasure.

128
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:50,838
-Thank you, sir.
-Good luck.

129
00:08:57,147 --> 00:09:00,241
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, hon.

130
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:05,044
You can go in there now.

131
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:12,955
You can sit.

132
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:19,634
So...

133
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:23,571
Do you know what we
do here? My section?

134
00:09:25,842 --> 00:09:28,538
-Sir, yes, sir, I have an idea...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's say you have no idea...

135
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:30,406
and leave it at that, okay?

136
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:33,072
No idea. Zip. None.

137
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:35,498
If you had an idea
what we do, we would

138
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:37,176
not be good at what
we do, would we?

139
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:38,878
We would be cunts.

140
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,081
Are you calling us cunts?

141
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:43,658
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

142
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:46,762
I'm afraid we all have
to get used to it.

143
00:09:47,364 --> 00:09:49,430
So you have family
connections down in

144
00:09:49,431 --> 00:09:51,391
Southie, right?
Through your father?

145
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:54,093
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

146
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:00,910
He was a carpet layer
for Jordan Marsh.

147
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:03,325
Uncle Jackie was a
small-time bookie who

148
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:05,377
tended bar at the
Vets in Somerville.

149
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:07,466
He got popped by
Nicastro in '95. We

150
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,280
found his body out by the airport.

151
00:10:11,555 --> 00:10:13,386
That's right.

152
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,949
-I remember his funeral.
-Oh, good.

153
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,355
Closed casket?

154
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,793
That's right.

155
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,334
So tell anybody up at Deerfield...

156
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:26,224
That is, before you got kicked
out for whaling

157
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,629
on a gym teacher with a folding chair.

158
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:30,204
You had an uncle met
his demise like that?

159
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:36,145
I got a question.

160
00:10:36,313 --> 00:10:38,372
How fucked up are you?

161
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:51,786
Hi, Darlene.

162
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:58,195
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

163
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:03,172
-SIU. What a country.
-Ha. Perfect.

164
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:07,303
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

165
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:09,109
You know, if you
went alone every once in

166
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,605
a while you might get somewhere.

167
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:13,443
We're cops, alright?
This isn't somewhere.

168
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,409
Alright, lookit, I
know you're a worker.

169
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,353
Maybe I can do something for you.

170
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:20,618
You got any suits,
or do you like...

171
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,624
coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

172
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:28,626
You got quite the family tree here,
kid. That maggot uncle of yours...

173
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,166
Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

174
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:35,361
to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

175
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:37,330
from our normative behaviour.

176
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:38,872
And what's this got to do with me huh?

177
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:40,805
Why are you pretending
to be a cop?

178
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:48,148
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

179
00:11:48,318 --> 00:11:50,123
You have been selected
for it on the

180
00:11:50,124 --> 00:11:51,879
basis of intelligence
and aptitude.

181
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:55,149
This is an elite unit.

182
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:59,591
Our job is to smash or
marginally disrupt...

183
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:01,822
organised crime in this city...

184
00:12:01,998 --> 00:12:04,728
by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI...

185
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:07,665
represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

186
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:09,999
And we will do it.

187
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:13,631
And by organised crime in this
city, you know who we mean.

188
00:12:13,944 --> 00:12:16,105
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

189
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,338
Jackie met his demise.

190
00:12:18,682 --> 00:12:20,445
Last known photograph.

191
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:24,077
Costello uses three key guys.

192
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:27,781
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

193
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,654
She's straight out
of Going My Way.

194
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:32,920
Delahunt, muscle.

195
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:34,843
French, the number one. But of

196
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:37,055
course, the rock
star, you know who.

197
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:39,964
We've done a briefing book, so
read up. I want any and all ideas...

198
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:42,298
so I can pass them off as my own.

199
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:44,104
Work hard and you'll
rise fast. You're

200
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:45,600
in the best possible position...

201
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:47,539
in the department.
Let's go to work.

202
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:50,008
Your old man was a fucking
hump from Southie.

203
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,149
Baggage handler at
the airport, right?

204
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:55,784
Family's all criminals
except for the old man, huh?

205
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:58,420
And one priest, since you
seem to know everything.

206
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:00,737
Well, last I heard he was happily
married to a 12-year-old

207
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,456
boy, living on a
beach in Thailand.

208
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:05,527
Fucking family's dug into the
Southie projects like ticks.

209
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:07,993
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

210
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:12,033
on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

211
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:14,432
You were kind of a double
kid, I bet, right?

212
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:17,538
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

213
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:20,972
You're upper-middle class during
the weeks, then you're dropping your eyes and you're hanging...

214
00:13:21,144 --> 00:13:24,113
in the big, bad Southie projects with your
daddy, the fucking donkey...

215
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:26,772
on the weekends. I got that right?

216
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:30,714
Yup. You have different accents?

217
00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:33,779
You did didn't you, you
little fucking snake?

218
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:37,188
-You were like different people.
-You a psychiatrist?

219
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,329
Well if I was, I'd ask you why you're
a statie making 30 grand a year.

220
00:13:40,497 --> 00:13:42,370
And I think if I was
Sigmund fucking

221
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:43,989
Freud I wouldn't get an answer.

222
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:47,137
So tell me, what's a
lace-curtain motherfucker

223
00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:49,230
like you doing in the staties?

224
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,732
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

225
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,538
-Who said that?
-Hawthorne.

226
00:13:57,547 --> 00:13:59,177
What's the matter, smart-ass, you

227
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:01,005
don't know any
fucking Shakespeare?

228
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,350
We have a question.

229
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:12,188
Do you wanna be a cop, or do
you wanna appear to be a cop?

230
00:14:12,362 --> 00:14:13,659
It's an honest question.

231
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,761
Lot of guys want to
appear to be cops.

232
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:17,493
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

233
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:20,295
A lot of them just wanna slam
a nigger's head through a plate-glass window...

234
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,268
I'm set without your own personal
job application, alright sergeant?

235
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,704
-What the fuck did you say to me, trainee?
-With all due respect sir, what do you want from me?

236
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:26,967
Hey, asshole, he can't help you.

237
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:29,111
I know what you are, okay?
I know what you are...

238
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,644
and I know what you're not.

239
00:14:30,814 --> 00:14:32,532
I'm the best friend
you have on the face of this Earth and I'm

240
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,250
gonna help you understand
something you punk.

241
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,385
You're no fucking cop.

242
00:14:37,954 --> 00:14:41,082
He's right. We deal
in deception here.

243
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:44,091
What we do not deal
with is self-deception.

244
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:47,094
Five years from now you could
be anything else in the world.

245
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:50,859
But you will not be a
Massachusetts state trooper.

246
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:53,695
-Are you sure of that?
-I'm sure of that.

247
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,962
Guaran-fucking-teed.

248
00:14:57,274 --> 00:15:01,870
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

249
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,975
You don't have much family.

250
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:08,644
I don't have any family.

251
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,659
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

252
00:15:17,827 --> 00:15:20,762
You mean Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

253
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:24,332
-That Stephanie?
-Yeah, that Stephanie.

254
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:26,248
Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.

255
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:28,335
You trying to prove something
to the family?

256
00:15:28,505 --> 00:15:33,499
When you say the family, who
do you mean exactly? You?

257
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:36,911
You always have to question
everything, don't you?

258
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,119
Maybe it would've
done you some good to

259
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,107
have some questions
from time to time you know?

260
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:43,980
Am I an asshole? Are
my kids a mess?

261
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:46,603
Is my wife a
money-grubbing whore? I

262
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:48,853
mean, those are questions, right?

263
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:51,625
Have I ever been good
to my dying sister,

264
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:53,792
or am I just now pretending to be?

265
00:15:58,001 --> 00:16:00,936
Do you need some money
for the funeral?

266
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:06,968
When my mother dies, we don't
have any more connection.

267
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,010
It's very lovely. You get
the high ceilings,

268
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,573
the parquet floors.
Uhhh...bathroom is massive.

269
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:15,377
The fridge has got an alarm
in it in case you have uh...

270
00:16:15,552 --> 00:16:18,783
you know, eating issues, which is a
joke. Not a very funny one.

271
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:21,039
Well, there's a great
view of the State

272
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,914
House. Beacon Hill,
if you can see it.

273
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:26,495
I mean, you move in, you're
upper-class by about Tuesday.

274
00:16:27,497 --> 00:16:31,228
-So you're a cop.
-A state-police detective.

275
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:33,232
A state-police detective.

276
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:36,738
And are you a married
state-police detective?

277
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:38,406
No.

278
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:42,004
Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...

279
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:44,203
I have a co-signer.

280
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:49,075
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend to have
a house guest. That's cool. Good.

281
00:16:49,252 --> 00:16:51,550
-Yeah, it's got...
-Just give me the papers.

282
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:54,184
Sure.

283
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:57,231
Eternal rest grant
unto her, O Lord, and

284
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:59,492
let perpetual light
shine upon her.

285
00:16:59,662 --> 00:17:02,187
-Amen.
-May she rest in peace. Amen.

286
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:05,562
May her soul and the souls of
all the faithful departed...

287
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:08,932
through the mercy of
God rest in peace.

288
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,903
Amen.

289
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,329
So what do I do?

290
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:37,540
There's money behind
this operation.

291
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,465
You won't be paid
as a regular cop...

292
00:17:39,636 --> 00:17:41,729
but there's a bonus involved.

293
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:44,238
Tax-free.

294
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:47,381
We can't conceal that you were a

295
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:50,144
trainee. You'll be
convicted of a crime.

296
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:51,965
We're thinking a guilty plea to

297
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:54,044
assault and battery
would make sense.

298
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:55,275
Given your nature.

299
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:58,454
You'll do enough jail time to
convince anyone this is no setup.

300
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:01,146
You'll be on probation, see
a court-ordered shrink...

301
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:03,019
the whole nine yards.

302
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:07,520
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

303
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:10,055
We need you, pal.

304
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:13,100
You've already pretended to be
a Costigan from South Boston.

305
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:17,228
-Every weekend, Sergeant.
-Perfect.

306
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:20,739
Do it again.

307
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:23,572
For me.

308
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,816
-Hey, you Billy Costigan?
-Yeah, who wants to know?

309
00:19:00,984 --> 00:19:03,885
Well, nothing. I know a Sean
Costigan down on L Street.

310
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:07,386
-Yeah, that's my cousin.
-Connected. Not too bright.

311
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:10,219
-Yeah, I know.
-I mean, no offence.

312
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:29,074
-Billy?
-Yeah, it's me.

313
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:32,180
-Oh, my God! Good to see you.
-Aunt Kathy, how are you?

314
00:19:32,348 --> 00:19:35,340
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

315
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:39,685
They said you was in the
staties. I couldn't believe it.

316
00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:42,120
I got kicked out, like,
four months ago.

317
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:44,522
Yeah, it was in the papers.

318
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:48,057
So you know.

319
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:51,064
And why are we graced
with your presence?

320
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:54,036
I brought your mother some
pictures of my father.

321
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:57,332
-Look at the smile.
-My mother had them. My uh...

322
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:00,136
My mother's dead.

323
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:04,704
I'm sorry. Sorry
for your troubles.

324
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:07,441
I was at a funeral myself, man.

325
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:10,618
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

326
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:15,049
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

327
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:17,386
-You remember that. What a night.
-Listen. Listen, listen.

328
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:20,885
I got, like...

329
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:23,658
Like 30,000 bucks,
right? Insurance money.

330
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:24,659
Yeah.

331
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:27,465
You know, after my mother
passed and everything.

332
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:30,299
In your line of work,
if I gave you...

333
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:34,170
like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

334
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:37,709
You know what you...

335
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,212
You know what you usually
say at these moments.

336
00:20:40,383 --> 00:20:44,479
-What? What?
-Come on, man.

337
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:48,556
Oh, come on, you fucking
moron. Come on.

338
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:50,352
What, you want me to say it?

339
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,065
I'm not a cop, alright?

340
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,400
-I'm your fucking cousin.
-You're, you're bad.

341
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:05,365
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

342
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:10,103
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

343
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,807
If they knew shit, they
wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

344
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:17,453
R is for Ricans P is for pigs.

345
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,714
Would you shut the fuck
up for five seconds, huh?

346
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,859
That's right. You
used to be a cop.

347
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,615
When we're working together just

348
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:27,461
limit it to two
eight-balls an hour.

349
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,383
We're not even
supposed to be doing

350
00:21:29,384 --> 00:21:31,088
this shit this close to Worcester.

351
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:32,700
This side of Worcester.

352
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:36,599
-Says who?
-Says him. Says Costello.

353
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:38,764
God says, as far as you're...

354
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:40,773
concerned.

355
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,815
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

356
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:49,349
-Cunt cop.
-No, no, no.

357
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,283
He talks like his shit don't
stink, but he's good people.

358
00:21:52,455 --> 00:21:54,923
Well, I knew his father.

359
00:21:55,224 --> 00:21:57,818
-I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
-Jackie was alright.

360
00:21:57,994 --> 00:22:00,485
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

361
00:22:00,663 --> 00:22:02,631
Fucking guineas.

362
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:05,299
-To Jackie.
-Uncle Jackie.

363
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:08,560
Cranberry juice.

364
00:22:10,273 --> 00:22:11,900
It's a natural diuretic.

365
00:22:12,075 --> 00:22:15,272
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

366
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:18,377
What, do you got your period?

367
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:25,019
-Fucking...
-Get off.

368
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:31,822
-Get your fucking hands off me.
-Hey. Hey, hey.

369
00:22:33,296 --> 00:22:34,888
Do you know me?

370
00:22:35,164 --> 00:22:36,927
No. No.

371
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:41,301
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

372
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:43,462
and there's guys you can't.

373
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:45,630
Now, that's not quite a
guy you can't hit...

374
00:22:45,808 --> 00:22:48,072
but it's almost a
guy you can't hit.

375
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:50,906
So I'm gonna make a fucking
ruling on this right now.

376
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,106
You don't fucking hit
him. You understand?

377
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,479
Yeah, excellent. Fine fine, fine.

378
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,585
I fucking know you.
I know your family.

379
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:06,720
You make one more drug deal...

380
00:23:06,896 --> 00:23:09,729
with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

381
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:13,195
and I'll forget your
grandmother was so nice to me.

382
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:16,463
I'll cut your fucking nuts
off. You understand that?

383
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:21,372
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

384
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,803
What are you drinking?

385
00:23:31,654 --> 00:23:33,781
A cranberry juice.

386
00:23:35,124 --> 00:23:37,251
What is it, your period?

387
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:43,527
Get him a cranberry juice.

388
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:52,097
Hey, fuckhead, that's
Jackie's nephew.

389
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:55,939
What? Oh, fucking what?

390
00:23:59,749 --> 00:24:01,080
Get the fuck out of here.

391
00:24:01,451 --> 00:24:02,918
Sorry I'm late.

392
00:24:03,085 --> 00:24:06,020
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our
liaison to the undercover section.

393
00:24:06,189 --> 00:24:07,781
His undercover work is extensive.

394
00:24:07,957 --> 00:24:10,187
He's here to give us his
report. Sergeant Dignam.

395
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:12,589
Okay, my people are out there.

396
00:24:12,762 --> 00:24:15,322
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

397
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:17,932
You're not gonna hear about them except through
me or Captain Queenan.

398
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,933
You will not ever know the
identity of undercover people.

399
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:23,906
Unfortunately, this shithole has
more fucking leaks than the Iraqi navy.

400
00:24:23,907 --> 00:24:24,907
Fuck yourself.

401
00:24:24,908 --> 00:24:26,471
I'm tired from fucking your wife.

402
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:28,906
-How's your mother?
-Good, she's tired from fucking my father.

403
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:30,912
Good. Today, girls...

404
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,980
what I have for you is microprocessors.

405
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:37,482
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

406
00:24:37,653 --> 00:24:40,213
from the Mass Processor
Company out on Route 128.

407
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:42,653
These are the kind of processors they
put into computers...

408
00:24:42,825 --> 00:24:45,658
that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

409
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:47,659
from a couple hundred miles away.

410
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,663
These little pieces of plastic are
worth about 100 grand apiece.

411
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:53,393
Now get this, we got a guy working for
the company two months...

412
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:56,504
walks out the door with a box
of processors on Tuesday...

413
00:24:56,672 --> 00:24:58,731
has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

414
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:01,274
but on Thursday, he gets
found in a dumpster.

415
00:25:01,444 --> 00:25:03,605
You know where that
dirtball started his life?

416
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:05,337
Southie projects.

417
00:25:05,515 --> 00:25:08,177
-What was his name, the departed?
-Myles Kennefick.

418
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:11,377
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

419
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:13,283
-which happens to...
-South Boston?

420
00:25:13,456 --> 00:25:16,516
Oh, you're a fucking genius. Who
forged your transcript, dickhead?

421
00:25:16,692 --> 00:25:19,889
Hey, this guy, his old man runs the Hibernian
Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

422
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,791
We're not here to solve the
case of the missing scumbag.

423
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:26,400
We're here to nail Costello.

424
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:28,036
Alright, look. We got a guy...

425
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:30,729
says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

426
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:33,375
He set up the whole fucking
job and popped Kennefick.

427
00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:35,943
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

428
00:25:36,112 --> 00:25:38,082
We'd miss a lot less if you
made your informants

429
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,548
available to us and of course, to the Bureau.

430
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:41,645
Without asking for
too many details, do

431
00:25:41,646 --> 00:25:43,446
you have anyone in
with Costello now?

432
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,218
Maybe. Maybe not.

433
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:48,084
Maybe fuck yourself.

434
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:50,589
My theory on Feds is
they're like mushrooms.

435
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,660
Feed them shit and
keep them in the dark.

436
00:25:52,828 --> 00:25:54,455
You girls have a good day.

437
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:58,927
Normally he's a very, uh, nice guy.

438
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:01,001
Don't judge him from
this meeting alone.

439
00:26:04,073 --> 00:26:07,236
Now, Mrs Kennefick,
I knew your son.

440
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,139
I knew Myles.

441
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:12,145
Now he was little younger than me, but
he was behind me in school.

442
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:14,476
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

443
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,642
Would you like to help us? You
wanna help us catch the people...

444
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,653
who forced your son to do a
robbery and then killed him?

445
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,655
Allegedly.

446
00:26:23,593 --> 00:26:24,821
Allegedly.

447
00:26:24,994 --> 00:26:27,462
If he was killed, he probably
did something wrong.

448
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,598
But not the robbery.
That's not wrong.

449
00:26:29,765 --> 00:26:31,824
He did something else wrong?

450
00:26:34,103 --> 00:26:37,129
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

451
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:41,170
I mean, fuck yourself.

452
00:26:42,812 --> 00:26:45,280
-Did you get that?
-Allegedly or fuck yourself?

453
00:26:45,448 --> 00:26:47,014
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

454
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:48,884
Different breed down here, Sarge.

455
00:26:50,386 --> 00:26:51,853
I need a cup of coffee.

456
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:07,865
You making a house call?

457
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:10,495
Have I seen you professionally?

458
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:14,165
No, no. No, I know who
you are, though. I know.

459
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:18,006
Guys gotta use their service
revolver in the course of duty...

460
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,954
and then they get
to come to talk to

461
00:27:19,955 --> 00:27:21,775
you about their
feelings and whatnot.

462
00:27:21,951 --> 00:27:25,785
No, no, I know how it goes. You're
a mental health professional.

463
00:27:25,955 --> 00:27:27,616
I have an appointment
on this floor.

464
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,248
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're
all frigging crazy on that floor.

465
00:27:31,427 --> 00:27:33,520
-I'm one more up.
-Oh, fancy policeman.

466
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:35,789
-Yeah, that's right, fancy.
-Are you a statie?

467
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:39,093
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

468
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:40,565
Suffolk, nights?

469
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:43,603
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

470
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:45,519
When's the last time you checked?

471
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,265
Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

472
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:50,207
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.

473
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,041
Well, I thought you were. So
now you gotta buy me dinner.

474
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:56,013
Maybe you can shoot someone and
then see me professionally.

475
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:58,911
I'll stab someone in the
heart with a fucking

476
00:27:58,912 --> 00:28:01,282
ice pick if it gets
me dinner with you.

477
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:03,687
Wait. No, no, that's alright. I'm a
detective. I'll find you.

478
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:06,885
No, sorry. I'm just joking. I
need the card. Card helps.

479
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:08,553
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

480
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:22,171
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about
the tail until I saw it.

481
00:28:22,344 --> 00:28:25,177
No, I couldn't. I had the other
guy with me, I couldn't...

482
00:28:25,347 --> 00:28:28,475
Alright, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

483
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:31,779
It's fucked up with graffiti on the side. And
the van is the audio surveillance.

484
00:28:31,954 --> 00:28:33,251
Alright, have a nice day.

485
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:36,252
Cut him here.

486
00:28:37,026 --> 00:28:38,493
Bye-bye.

487
00:28:42,732 --> 00:28:43,756
Jerk-ass!

488
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:46,595
Come on, Babu. I can't do
any more. I cannot hold off.

489
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:50,296
Please don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

490
00:28:50,473 --> 00:28:53,442
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

491
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:56,100
This is Friday, Babu. How
many times I gotta tell you?

492
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:59,304
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

493
00:28:59,482 --> 00:29:00,710
I'm trying to help you.

494
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:02,601
You keep telling me
I'm your friend.

495
00:29:02,602 --> 00:29:04,319
You don't even know
my fucking name.

496
00:29:04,487 --> 00:29:07,945
You want me to catch a beating? I'm gonna catch
a beating if I go back again like last week.

497
00:29:08,124 --> 00:29:09,830
See this guy? You
see this guy? This

498
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,582
guy don't want you
to have the money.

499
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:14,594
Because he wants to come back
there and squash your head.

500
00:29:14,764 --> 00:29:17,198
-And I don't want to see that happen.
-I have one customer sitting here. What I'm gonna do?

501
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:20,233
Business is bad? You opened a
store in an Irish neighbourhood.

502
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:22,632
These are dirty, dirty people.
Don't you know that?

503
00:29:22,805 --> 00:29:25,035
Sell potatoes, I don't
know what you're gonna do.

504
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:27,176
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse me. Sorry.

505
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:28,301
Know what I'm saying?

506
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:30,001
Hey, you fellas come from Providence?

507
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,238
It isn't any of your business
where we come from, is it, now?

508
00:29:32,414 --> 00:29:34,939
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

509
00:29:44,794 --> 00:29:47,957
Hey. You are killing
my business, man.

510
00:29:48,697 --> 00:29:49,891
Fuck.

511
00:29:50,065 --> 00:29:51,481
What's wrong with this fucking

512
00:29:51,482 --> 00:29:53,228
country? Everybody
hates everybody.

513
00:29:58,574 --> 00:30:00,508
Get out of here. Get out of here.

514
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:09,020
Now, you also do
probation work, right?

515
00:30:09,021 --> 00:30:10,846
That's right, I see
violent offenders.

516
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,081
-Oh, bad guys.
-Not necessarily.

517
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:23,731
You know, they got this but they
don't got duck L'orange.

518
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:25,457
Was your meal okay?

519
00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:27,192
Yeah, no, no, the lobster was good.

520
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:30,770
I was just, you know, because it was a
French restaurant I was surprised.

521
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:38,275
I'm waiting for you
to make your move.

522
00:30:38,447 --> 00:30:41,382
Look, I don't know, if that thing
moves, I'm gonna shoot it.

523
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,915
I don't even know what it is.

524
00:30:50,226 --> 00:30:53,024
So what's it like having
people find themselves...

525
00:30:53,195 --> 00:30:55,060
in your office all day long?

526
00:30:55,231 --> 00:30:57,859
Does it get messy with all
those feelings flying around?

527
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:01,567
Why, does that make
you uncomfortable?

528
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,136
-No, no, no.
-No?

529
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:05,637
No, no, no. No, I'm
not on your couch.

530
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:09,204
Well, you know what Freud
said about the Irish?

531
00:31:09,378 --> 00:31:10,777
Yeah, I do.

532
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:14,111
Yeah, if you actually
do, I'll see you again.

533
00:31:15,084 --> 00:31:17,917
Who says I wanna see you again?

534
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,553
Don't you?

535
00:31:25,294 --> 00:31:27,194
-You should see your face.
-Don't you?

536
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:28,796
Of course I wanna see you again!

537
00:31:29,498 --> 00:31:31,523
What Freud said about
the Irish is...

538
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,966
we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

539
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:39,271
-Yeah, he said that.
-I know he did.

540
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:42,604
So you're up shit's creek with a
client list full of Mick cops.

541
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:44,769
I mean, opening up?
Good luck to you.

542
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:47,108
Why do you do it, then?

543
00:31:48,317 --> 00:31:50,444
Some people do get better.

544
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:54,786
Fair enough.

545
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:56,878
Sometimes I want
people to forget about their

546
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:58,654
personal bullshit
and do their jobs.

547
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:00,856
Including the criminals?

548
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,294
Well, if they don't do their
jobs, you don't have one.

549
00:32:04,066 --> 00:32:07,194
I'll always have a job. I'll
just arrest innocent people.

550
00:32:08,604 --> 00:32:11,198
-Wait. You are trouble.
-You don't know the half of it.

551
00:32:11,373 --> 00:32:13,466
I'll arrest you right now.

552
00:32:14,677 --> 00:32:16,577
My word against yours.

553
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:20,673
...then I see her dancing at the
wedding with you-know-who.

554
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:24,104
Oh and the other one I says to him, why don't
you go up to Parents Without Partners?

555
00:32:24,124 --> 00:32:26,052
And he goes, 'Ma, they're all losers at

556
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:28,151
the Parents Without
Partners,' so...

557
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:33,159
So I say to him, Princess
Carolina of Monaco...

558
00:32:35,864 --> 00:32:37,195
Schuyler.

559
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:53,177
Do you know who I am?

560
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:57,942
No.

561
00:33:01,957 --> 00:33:06,291
You met my friend Mr.
French the other night.

562
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:18,963
His real name Mr. French?

563
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:23,538
No.

564
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:29,117
Come with me.

565
00:33:33,655 --> 00:33:37,921
I'm not the cops.
I'm not asking you.

566
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:42,310
You know something,
they just do not

567
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,591
stop having the Mafia
in Providence.

568
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:48,635
And this can cause me
a lot of problems.

569
00:33:54,676 --> 00:33:57,543
Those guys you tuned up...

570
00:33:57,713 --> 00:33:59,874
they're connected down Providence.

571
00:34:01,383 --> 00:34:02,782
What they're gonna do...

572
00:34:02,951 --> 00:34:06,546
is come back with some
guys and kill you.

573
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:09,748
Which, sure as you're
born, they will do.

574
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:12,325
Unless I stop them.

575
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:14,562
Do you want me to stop them?

576
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,929
Is this something I
can't do personally?

577
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:25,603
I'm gonna have my
associate search you.

578
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:28,072
No, No one's fucking searching me.
Search me for what?

579
00:34:28,243 --> 00:34:30,973
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

580
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:33,014
Shoes.

581
00:34:39,655 --> 00:34:41,145
I knew your father.

582
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:47,456
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

583
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,299
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

584
00:34:52,067 --> 00:34:55,127
-Stand.
-He didn't complain.

585
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:58,034
Yeah, that was his problem.

586
00:34:58,674 --> 00:35:00,039
Who said he had a problem?

587
00:35:02,344 --> 00:35:04,869
I just said he had
a fucking problem.

588
00:35:06,181 --> 00:35:08,513
There's a man could've
been anything.

589
00:35:08,684 --> 00:35:11,084
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

590
00:35:11,253 --> 00:35:12,253
Fuck.

591
00:35:12,254 --> 00:35:14,689
I'm saying he worked
at the airport.

592
00:35:14,857 --> 00:35:16,722
-He's clean.
-Arm.

593
00:35:16,892 --> 00:35:18,154
Yeah, come on.

594
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:19,851
What arm? What fucking arm?

595
00:35:20,028 --> 00:35:23,361
Show me your arm. Flip it.

596
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:33,699
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighbourhood.

597
00:35:35,444 --> 00:35:36,775
He's clean.

598
00:35:36,945 --> 00:35:40,210
And if I can slander
my own environment...

599
00:35:40,382 --> 00:35:44,182
it makes me sad, this regression.

600
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:47,003
Plus, I don't know
if it's beyond some

601
00:35:47,004 --> 00:35:49,313
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

602
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:53,791
to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

603
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,896
I just can't know.

604
00:35:57,366 --> 00:36:01,564
I don't know what they do in that
particular department, anyway.

605
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:05,965
-Are you still a cop?!
-No. No.

606
00:36:06,508 --> 00:36:09,477
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

607
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:12,478
I am not a fucking cop!

608
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:15,937
Are you gonna stop
doing coke deals

609
00:36:15,938 --> 00:36:18,318
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?!

610
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:21,615
Yes, yes, yes. I am.

611
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:24,818
Alright, alright, alright.

612
00:36:24,993 --> 00:36:27,791
You're okay. You'll be alright.

613
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:31,197
Get your hand taken care of.

614
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:36,829
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

615
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:41,735
As for our problem
with Providence...

616
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:45,376
let's not cry over
spilled guineas.

617
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:50,885
Who let this IRA
motherfucker in my bar?

618
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:58,489
Just kidding. How's your mother?

619
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:00,895
She's on her way out.

620
00:37:01,063 --> 00:37:04,123
We all are. Act accordingly.

621
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,663
Here it is, Your
Highness, as ordered.

622
00:37:06,835 --> 00:37:08,996
Get in the car. I wanna
show you something.

623
00:37:09,171 --> 00:37:10,920
What's got you all
hot and bothered?

624
00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:12,265
Get in the car. You'll see.

625
00:37:13,141 --> 00:37:15,769
Do you trust him?

626
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:17,639
Well, these days um...

627
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,938
who's reliable?

628
00:37:20,482 --> 00:37:22,450
His Uncle Jackie was.

629
00:37:23,151 --> 00:37:25,184
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy

630
00:37:25,185 --> 00:37:27,611
acts like he's got
nothing to lose.

631
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:34,258
I'm reliable.

632
00:37:35,063 --> 00:37:38,499
Arnold, you're one in a million.

633
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:41,329
Ten. Ten million.

634
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:45,968
What about your wife, Arnold?

635
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:50,035
Well, I thought she was.

636
00:37:51,513 --> 00:37:53,310
She wasn't.

637
00:37:55,617 --> 00:37:57,482
Well, she got reliable.

638
00:37:59,588 --> 00:38:02,614
Don't you people ever
shut the fuck up?

639
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:05,817
Oh, another county heard from.

640
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:07,723
One too many. She got a big mouth.

641
00:38:07,896 --> 00:38:09,989
Answer this for me, will you?

642
00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:32,736
Ah. The principles of
detection tell me these

643
00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:34,380
two gentlemen came
from Providence.

644
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:36,641
Lieutenant Risteen,
Lynn PD. I'd appreciate

645
00:38:36,642 --> 00:38:38,253
it you get out of my crime scene.

646
00:38:38,427 --> 00:38:41,191
Yeah, actually, it's my crime
scene, but knock yourself out.

647
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:42,830
Thanks.

648
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,328
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm
having post-traumatic stress.

649
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:51,301
Can I meet you for lunch?

650
00:38:51,473 --> 00:38:52,735
Alright, see you then.

651
00:38:57,179 --> 00:38:58,942
Who's the lead detective?

652
00:38:59,114 --> 00:39:01,947
Good. He's a lox.

653
00:39:10,092 --> 00:39:12,140
Get the cops to look
at Jimmy Pappas for

654
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,188
the hit. Of course, he had nothing
to do with it...

655
00:39:14,363 --> 00:39:16,092
and he'll say so.

656
00:39:16,264 --> 00:39:18,414
You look in his car, you'll
find the gun that

657
00:39:18,415 --> 00:39:20,564
did it, registered,
official. Providence.

658
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,931
In the trunk or the
glove compartment?

659
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,264
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

660
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,208
Hey, this will get Captain
Ellerby on the 6 o'clock news.

661
00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:35,680
No wonder you get ahead.

662
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,915
Have a seat, Bill.

663
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:54,067
Do you know John Lennon?

664
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:58,230
Yeah, sure, he was the
president before Lincoln.

665
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:02,903
Lennon said:

666
00:40:03,645 --> 00:40:05,340
I''m an artist.

667
00:40:05,514 --> 00:40:09,917
You give me a fucking tuba, I'll
get you something out of it.'

668
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:15,520
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

669
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,955
I'd like to squeeze some
fucking money out of it.

670
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:28,733
Smart-mouth.

671
00:40:29,671 --> 00:40:31,571
Too bad.

672
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:35,072
If you'll indulge me...

673
00:40:36,978 --> 00:40:37,978
Now what?

674
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:41,448
Choir practice.

675
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:43,815
Choir practice...

676
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:51,091
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

677
00:40:52,227 --> 00:40:55,993
a man could look at anything...

678
00:40:56,198 --> 00:40:57,825
and make something out of it.

679
00:40:57,999 --> 00:40:59,466
For instance...

680
00:40:59,634 --> 00:41:02,034
I look at you and I think

681
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:05,371
'What could I use you for?'

682
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:09,370
Get rid of this.

683
00:41:09,544 --> 00:41:11,034
French.

684
00:41:11,213 --> 00:41:13,681
Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.

685
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:15,544
Maybe we could work something out.

686
00:41:16,384 --> 00:41:19,683
-Good.
-And send this to his wife.

687
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:21,823
I thought was nice the way
you asked the guy...

688
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,220
which hand he jerked off with.

689
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,327
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

690
00:41:27,729 --> 00:41:30,163
As I remember, she ain't
that sentimental.

691
00:41:38,273 --> 00:41:41,037
That was quick. You think
he's dead already?

692
00:41:41,843 --> 00:41:43,902
We have to do it by
phone. I won't do it...

693
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,343
if I have to wear a wire.
No wires ever. Understand?

694
00:41:46,515 --> 00:41:48,086
You don't know what this is like.

695
00:41:48,087 --> 00:41:49,087
Microprocessors.

696
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:51,382
-Micro-what?
-Microprocessors.

697
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:54,420
We'll probably be at war with
the Chinese in 20-odd years...

698
00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:57,524
and Costello is selling
them military technology.

699
00:41:57,692 --> 00:42:00,092
Microprocessors,
chips, computer parts.

700
00:42:00,262 --> 00:42:02,526
Anybody says anything about
anything like that...

701
00:42:02,697 --> 00:42:03,697
you let us know.

702
00:42:07,669 --> 00:42:09,864
So who did the two
guys from Providence?

703
00:42:10,772 --> 00:42:12,535
Jimmy Pappas.

704
00:42:12,707 --> 00:42:14,698
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

705
00:42:15,977 --> 00:42:18,172
Jimmy had a rough month.

706
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:20,677
Jimmy had a heart
attack in jail...

707
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:24,046
and uh, then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

708
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:26,050
I believe it's been in the papers.

709
00:42:27,322 --> 00:42:29,256
You seem quite happy
with that result.

710
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:32,419
It's a fucking result.

711
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:35,859
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

712
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:39,057
Cui gives a shit? It's got
a friggin' bow on it.

713
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:44,302
I think you are a cop, my son.

714
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:47,634
-Where's your fucking licence?
-What licence?

715
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:50,744
I don't see no fucking license. There's no such
thing as a licence, of course.

716
00:42:50,912 --> 00:42:54,040
But you, you definitely
need to have fucking one.

717
00:42:54,215 --> 00:42:57,616
In fact, if you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

718
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:00,311
That means you're bringing some
undesirable elements...

719
00:43:00,488 --> 00:43:02,422
into Mr. Costello's area.

720
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:10,356
I was going for my
fucking cigarettes.

721
00:43:10,532 --> 00:43:11,556
Hey.

722
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,832
That's Jimmy Bags.

723
00:43:19,007 --> 00:43:21,737
-He was rea... I don't know.
-What the fuck you doing?

724
00:43:22,877 --> 00:43:24,538
I'm in the hole, I
pay him two grand a week.

725
00:43:24,713 --> 00:43:26,510
There's no profit, I
pay him two grand a week.

726
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:28,581
Then make more fucking money.
This is America.

727
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:32,049
You don't make money, you're a fucking
douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

728
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,848
-Make more money.
-That's the spirit.

729
00:43:35,023 --> 00:43:37,116
-Oh, fuck.
-Don't worry about it.

730
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:39,817
The guy don't need any
fucking teeth anyway.

731
00:43:40,028 --> 00:43:43,122
It's a small surveillance
subunit, but it's mine.

732
00:43:43,298 --> 00:43:46,165
I didn't take this job to fuck
up or let anyone else fuck up.

733
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:50,566
I hand-picked this group. You're
my A-team. Now, our prim...

734
00:43:51,373 --> 00:43:52,465
Hi, Captain.

735
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:53,835
This crazy fuck...

736
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:55,910
-knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
-So?

737
00:43:55,911 --> 00:43:56,911
Look, he was reaching for
his fucking...

738
00:43:56,912 --> 00:43:58,404
Guy was reaching for
his cigarettes.

739
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,413
You're gonna give me shit huh? Look, it
wasn't for no reason, alright Frank?

740
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:02,845
The man reached into his coat.

741
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:05,248
I don't know if he's a
bookie or what the fuck he's doing.

742
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,854
Well, you do know what a
bookie does, don't you?

743
00:44:08,023 --> 00:44:10,082
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

744
00:44:10,258 --> 00:44:12,522
Queenan's compartmentalising
everything in SIU...

745
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:14,025
which is the right thing to do.

746
00:44:14,195 --> 00:44:16,823
Personally, I don't trust half the
fucking troopers out there any more.

747
00:44:17,332 --> 00:44:19,232
Bottom line...

748
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:21,494
we think we might have a problem.

749
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:24,537
We think Costello's got a
rat in the state police.

750
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:28,607
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

751
00:44:28,777 --> 00:44:31,075
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

752
00:44:31,246 --> 00:44:33,840
No, no, not presently.

753
00:44:34,015 --> 00:44:35,448
But I'm working on that.

754
00:44:35,617 --> 00:44:37,744
Here, Bill, this is for you.

755
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,049
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

756
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:45,715
You ask for Mikey because
there is no Mikey.

757
00:44:45,994 --> 00:44:48,792
You wait. We'll call you.

758
00:44:48,963 --> 00:44:50,624
-You got that?
-Yeah, I got that.

759
00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:53,734
-Sorry, I didn't hear you.
-I got that.

760
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:55,529
Good.

761
00:44:57,038 --> 00:44:58,903
Hi, Dad.

762
00:44:59,607 --> 00:45:01,871
I got promoted. Alright.

763
00:45:19,427 --> 00:45:21,395
Excuse me for one second.

764
00:45:22,497 --> 00:45:24,294
You know...

765
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:27,933
if your father were alive...

766
00:45:28,103 --> 00:45:30,162
and saw you here
sitting with me...

767
00:45:30,338 --> 00:45:32,602
let's say he'd have a
word with me about this.

768
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:35,572
In fact, he'd kill seven
guys just to cut my throat.

769
00:45:35,744 --> 00:45:37,974
And he could do it...

770
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,448
which is maybe something you don't
know about William Costigan Sr.

771
00:45:47,222 --> 00:45:51,818
-So he never? I mean, never?
-No. No, no.

772
00:45:51,993 --> 00:45:55,485
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

773
00:45:55,663 --> 00:45:57,961
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

774
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:00,660
Your Uncle Jackie...

775
00:46:00,835 --> 00:46:03,285
he also would kill
my entire fucking

776
00:46:03,286 --> 00:46:05,602
family if he saw me here with you.

777
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:10,203
And I think about this.

778
00:46:16,117 --> 00:46:18,813
So what the fuck are
we talking about here?

779
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:22,522
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

780
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:24,715
School?

781
00:46:26,728 --> 00:46:29,458
With all due respect,
Mr. Costello...

782
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,724
school is out.

783
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:35,231
Maybe someday you'll
wake the fuck up.

784
00:46:37,038 --> 00:46:38,300
Good day, Fathers.

785
00:46:39,507 --> 00:46:40,507
Mr. Costello.

786
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:42,476
Good morning, Francis,
good morning.

787
00:46:42,644 --> 00:46:45,306
You recall our chat?

788
00:46:45,613 --> 00:46:47,706
Little boys...

789
00:46:48,149 --> 00:46:52,313
sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

790
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:55,321
I am as God made me. Was
that your rationale?

791
00:46:57,392 --> 00:46:59,476
May I remind you, in this

792
00:46:59,477 --> 00:47:02,728
archdiocese, God
don't run the bingo.

793
00:47:02,897 --> 00:47:06,924
May I remind you that pride
comes before the fall.

794
00:47:09,437 --> 00:47:12,406
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

795
00:47:12,574 --> 00:47:15,975
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

796
00:47:16,778 --> 00:47:18,939
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

797
00:47:19,113 --> 00:47:20,808
Pay them.

798
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:25,177
Get the old bombardier
a drink on the house.

799
00:47:31,993 --> 00:47:33,094
What do you got for me, trooper?

800
00:47:33,095 --> 00:47:35,121
Uniform clipped him for
suspended licence.

801
00:47:35,296 --> 00:47:37,662
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...

802
00:47:37,832 --> 00:47:39,766
More than one, yeah. He's
one of Costello's crew.

803
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:42,494
Yeah, we're getting a warrant. We can't
get an address off of him.

804
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:45,332
He paged his lawyer but the
lawyer hasn't called back yet.

805
00:47:45,406 --> 00:47:46,406
Who's the lawyer?

806
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:48,134
He didn't know the name.
Just had a number on a card.

807
00:47:48,877 --> 00:47:50,276
Beeper number.

808
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:53,277
SULLIVAN: And the guy didn't show up?
BROWN: No.

809
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:56,647
-And he beeped him?
-Twice.

810
00:48:00,889 --> 00:48:03,357
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

811
00:48:03,524 --> 00:48:05,651
BARRIGAN: What?
SULLIVAN: Turn the fucking camera off.

812
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,822
Give it to me. He
doesn't know what

813
00:48:07,823 --> 00:48:09,254
the fucking lawyer looks like.

814
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,489
Whose briefcase is
this? Alright.

815
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:12,928
-It's off?
-You're good.

816
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:15,763
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

817
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:18,265
-He can't do that.
-He just did.

818
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:21,897
-You my attorney?
-What do you think?

819
00:48:23,077 --> 00:48:25,068
Now, have you made any statements
or phone calls...

820
00:48:25,246 --> 00:48:26,907
I need to be made aware of?

821
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:31,611
I beeped you.

822
00:48:31,853 --> 00:48:34,913
The card they gave me. That's it.

823
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:38,490
-That's it?
-That's it.

824
00:48:41,696 --> 00:48:43,129
I think you need to call your mother...

825
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:45,596
tell her you're not gonna
be home for supper.

826
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:53,832
Camera's off. It's
off. Call your mother.

827
00:48:57,111 --> 00:49:00,444
Lookit, they're suiting
up for a raid right now.

828
00:49:00,682 --> 00:49:04,209
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

829
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,744
So make the call.

830
00:49:12,393 --> 00:49:15,851
Lookit fuckstick, you
don't gotta trust me...

831
00:49:17,265 --> 00:49:19,927
just listen to what
I'm saying to you.

832
00:49:36,718 --> 00:49:41,212
Mum, I'm not gonna make
it home for supper.

833
00:49:41,389 --> 00:49:43,323
Sorry, yeah, I got held up.

834
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:47,794
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

835
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:52,061
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

836
00:49:52,233 --> 00:49:53,996
Bye.

837
00:49:54,202 --> 00:49:57,399
Everybody out. Move.

838
00:50:14,522 --> 00:50:15,750
Thank you.

839
00:50:17,058 --> 00:50:18,491
So who are you?

840
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:20,470
I think you need a
different attorney after all,

841
00:50:20,471 --> 00:50:22,095
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

842
00:50:22,263 --> 00:50:23,924
So when the fuck am
I gonna get out?

843
00:50:24,098 --> 00:50:27,431
Alright, run the last number
he called. That's his house.

844
00:50:27,602 --> 00:50:30,298
Now whatever the address is, I'll swear to
the judge I surveilled him there...

845
00:50:30,471 --> 00:50:32,564
and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

846
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:36,107
-Why did you use my phone?
-Because you didn't go in there.

847
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:49,086
The light's nice
here in the morning.

848
00:50:54,062 --> 00:50:56,690
So do you wanna talk
about last night?

849
00:51:03,337 --> 00:51:05,151
You know, it's alright.
Guys tend

850
00:51:05,152 --> 00:51:06,864
to make too big a deal out of it.

851
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:14,381
It's actually quite common.

852
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:16,141
I gotta go to work.

853
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,190
Do you lie?

854
00:51:28,596 --> 00:51:31,087
Why? Do you?

855
00:51:31,265 --> 00:51:32,960
No, I'm asking if you lie.

856
00:51:34,035 --> 00:51:36,435
Honesty is not
synonymous with truth.

857
00:51:36,604 --> 00:51:38,697
Yeah, you lie.

858
00:51:38,873 --> 00:51:40,033
You lie.

859
00:51:40,341 --> 00:51:42,866
Is it to do some good, to
get somewhere personally...

860
00:51:43,044 --> 00:51:45,103
or, what, just for the fuck of it?

861
00:51:45,746 --> 00:51:50,706
Well, I expect that some people do
it to keep things on an even keel.

862
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:56,146
Wow. So you had a parent
who was a drunk.

863
00:52:00,027 --> 00:52:01,756
Did you?

864
00:52:01,929 --> 00:52:03,556
No.

865
00:52:05,867 --> 00:52:07,630
Let's keep it with you.

866
00:52:07,802 --> 00:52:10,396
Talk about how you feel.

867
00:52:12,206 --> 00:52:14,504
How I feel.

868
00:52:14,675 --> 00:52:16,575
How I feel.

869
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:39,160
-Fuck!
-Brian, stop it.

870
00:52:44,438 --> 00:52:47,373
No. Please. No.

871
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:49,339
Ain't gonna hurt you.

872
00:52:52,847 --> 00:52:54,178
You sit there...

873
00:52:54,348 --> 00:52:56,578
with a mass murderer.

874
00:52:56,817 --> 00:52:58,546
A mass murderer.

875
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,916
Your heart rate is jacked.

876
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,719
And your hand...

877
00:53:06,394 --> 00:53:07,793
steady.

878
00:53:10,198 --> 00:53:14,498
That's one thing I figured out
about myself in prison. My hand...

879
00:53:14,669 --> 00:53:16,864
does not shake.

880
00:53:17,672 --> 00:53:19,162
Ever.

881
00:53:28,015 --> 00:53:30,142
Wake the fuck up.

882
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:34,611
There was a cop leaving
when I came in.

883
00:53:35,022 --> 00:53:36,990
How did you know he was a cop?

884
00:53:37,158 --> 00:53:39,679
Bad haircut, no dress
sense and a slight,

885
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,959
you know, air of
scumbag entitlement.

886
00:53:42,129 --> 00:53:44,290
-Do you see cops?
-That's part of what I do.

887
00:53:44,465 --> 00:53:47,662
I mean, I normally don't see cadets who've
been kicked out of the academy.

888
00:53:47,835 --> 00:53:51,066
Oh, boy. You should get
a better job, huh?

889
00:53:51,939 --> 00:53:53,600
Should I?

890
00:53:53,908 --> 00:53:57,241
So, do they all come in here...

891
00:53:57,411 --> 00:53:59,641
and cry, your cops?

892
00:54:00,147 --> 00:54:03,116
-Sometimes they do.
-Yeah?
-Yeah, sure. Sometimes they cry, yeah.

893
00:54:03,284 --> 00:54:04,815
If they've had trouble at home, if

894
00:54:04,816 --> 00:54:06,481
they've had to use
their weapons...

895
00:54:06,654 --> 00:54:08,781
Use their weapons?

896
00:54:09,323 --> 00:54:10,790
Let me tell you something.

897
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:13,256
They signed up to
use their weapons.

898
00:54:13,427 --> 00:54:15,895
Most of them, alright? But
they watch enough TV...

899
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,964
so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

900
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:22,159
There is no one more
full of shit than a cop.

901
00:54:22,336 --> 00:54:24,133
Except for a cop on TV.

902
00:54:31,579 --> 00:54:33,479
I looked at your file.

903
00:54:35,116 --> 00:54:37,175
I see that you have a
record of assault.

904
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:38,875
Yeah.

905
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:41,178
So what was it like
for you in jail?

906
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:43,846
What, you wanna hear
about the showers?

907
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,821
Is that what you wanna hear about?

908
00:54:45,993 --> 00:54:47,824
Did something happen to you?

909
00:54:48,195 --> 00:54:49,628
No.

910
00:54:51,832 --> 00:54:54,166
Okay kid, let's do this.
Come on, spread them.

911
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,292
Hey, you think you
can pop somebody...

912
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:58,194
and there's a special
card to play?

913
00:54:58,195 --> 00:54:59,871
That guy, Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

914
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:02,942
happens to work undercover for
the Boston Police Department.

915
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,476
I'm going fucking nuts man. I can't be
someone else every fucking day.

916
00:55:05,646 --> 00:55:07,238
It's been a year of this, I've had enough of this shit.

917
00:55:07,415 --> 00:55:10,543
Calm down alright? Most people in the world
do it every day. What's the big deal?

918
00:55:10,718 --> 00:55:13,064
Well, I'm not them.
I'm not fucking them, okay?

919
00:55:13,065 --> 00:55:14,065
Exactly.

920
00:55:14,066 --> 00:55:16,387
You're nobody. You signed
the papers, remember?

921
00:55:16,557 --> 00:55:20,118
Now we're the only two people on the face of this
Earth that even know you're a cop.

922
00:55:20,294 --> 00:55:22,319
How about we just
erase your file, huh?

923
00:55:22,496 --> 00:55:24,259
How about that, how about we erase your file...

924
00:55:24,432 --> 00:55:26,866
and then bang, you're just another
soldier for Costello...

925
00:55:27,034 --> 00:55:28,745
open to arrest for
I don't know how

926
00:55:28,746 --> 00:55:30,265
many felonies, huh? What do you say we do that Cap'n?

927
00:55:30,438 --> 00:55:34,033
How about I fucking kill you, huh?!
How about I fucking kill you?!

928
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:36,335
-That was a joke. Come on.
-That wasn't a joke.

929
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,740
Just 'cause you play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

930
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:41,534
you lace-curtain,
Irish fucking pussy.

931
00:55:41,535 --> 00:55:44,283
Hey, hey! Stop it!
Break it up! Stop it!

932
00:55:44,452 --> 00:55:45,930
Fuck you, motherfucker!

933
00:55:45,931 --> 00:55:48,354
Goddamn it, stop it!
That's an order!

934
00:55:49,123 --> 00:55:51,216
For Christ sake, be smart.

935
00:55:51,392 --> 00:55:54,691
If anybody's watching us now, how
are we not supposed to arrest you?

936
00:55:54,862 --> 00:55:56,420
Come on, get in the car.

937
00:55:56,597 --> 00:55:58,963
Both of you, get in the car!

938
00:56:01,235 --> 00:56:02,930
When are you gonna take Costello huh?

939
00:56:03,104 --> 00:56:05,231
I mean, what's wrong with taking
him on any one...

940
00:56:05,406 --> 00:56:07,127
of the million fucking
felonies that you've

941
00:56:07,128 --> 00:56:08,705
seen him do or I've seen him do?

942
00:56:08,876 --> 00:56:10,571
I mean, I mean, he murdered
somebody, right?

943
00:56:10,745 --> 00:56:13,680
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him.

944
00:56:13,848 --> 00:56:15,765
What are you waiting
for honestly? Do you want him

945
00:56:15,766 --> 00:56:17,545
to chop me up and
feed me to the poor?

946
00:56:17,718 --> 00:56:19,413
-Is that what you guys want?
-Yeah, that might stick.

947
00:56:19,587 --> 00:56:21,350
Will you shut up?

948
00:56:21,522 --> 00:56:23,888
We are building a case
and it takes time.

949
00:56:24,058 --> 00:56:25,286
You know that.

950
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:28,459
Something's wrong.

951
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:31,061
I'm telling you,
something's wrong.

952
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:34,659
Yeah, maybe.

953
00:56:35,236 --> 00:56:37,966
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, alright?

954
00:56:38,406 --> 00:56:40,135
No bullshit.

955
00:56:40,674 --> 00:56:42,349
I think Costello's
got a spy inside

956
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,837
the Special Investigation Unit.

957
00:56:46,747 --> 00:56:48,271
You...you serious?

958
00:56:48,449 --> 00:56:50,246
I'm afraid so.

959
00:56:54,255 --> 00:56:56,815
Have you heard anything like that?

960
00:56:56,991 --> 00:56:58,652
Aw, Jesus Christ.

961
00:57:00,861 --> 00:57:02,692
Hang tight for me, kid.

962
00:57:02,863 --> 00:57:04,660
Just a little while longer.

963
00:57:04,832 --> 00:57:07,130
We are this close.

964
00:57:09,203 --> 00:57:10,932
Alright?

965
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:13,968
What do you expect coming in here?

966
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:16,939
-I have to come here.
-I know you have to come here.

967
00:57:17,511 --> 00:57:20,036
But now that you're here...

968
00:57:20,314 --> 00:57:22,111
what do you want?

969
00:57:22,516 --> 00:57:23,949
You want the truth?

970
00:57:26,253 --> 00:57:27,811
Valium.

971
00:57:28,155 --> 00:57:29,535
Ugh, you know, if you lied, you would have an

972
00:57:29,536 --> 00:57:31,283
easier time getting
what you wanted.

973
00:57:31,459 --> 00:57:33,093
What's that say about what you do for a living?

974
00:57:33,094 --> 00:57:34,860
We should have a few
more meetings...

975
00:57:35,029 --> 00:57:37,094
before we even talk
about prescriptions.

976
00:57:37,095 --> 00:57:38,726
Look, look. I'm having panic attacks alright?

977
00:57:38,899 --> 00:57:41,042
The other night, I thought
I was having a fucking heart

978
00:57:41,043 --> 00:57:43,233
attack. I puked in a trash
barrel on the way over here.

979
00:57:43,404 --> 00:57:44,996
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

980
00:57:45,172 --> 00:57:46,696
-Is that true?
-Yeah, that's true, alright?

981
00:57:46,874 --> 00:57:49,570
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

982
00:57:49,743 --> 00:57:51,574
and you're gonna, what? You're gonna close my file?

983
00:57:51,745 --> 00:57:53,713
I didn't say I'd close
your file. I...no, I...

984
00:57:53,714 --> 00:57:55,374
I thought I was
supposed to tell...

985
00:57:55,549 --> 00:57:57,402
the truth here, if
only fucking here.

986
00:57:57,403 --> 00:57:58,403
You are. Yes. Okay.

987
00:57:58,404 --> 00:58:00,360
When a guy comes in here
against every, every instinct

988
00:58:00,361 --> 00:58:02,449
of privacy, of self-reliance
that he has...

989
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,623
and what do you do?

990
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:05,725
What do you do, huh? You
send him off on the

991
00:58:05,726 --> 00:58:07,852
street to score smack?
Is that what you do?

992
00:58:08,395 --> 00:58:10,761
You're fucking ridiculous.

993
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:21,136
Two pills? Great.

994
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:23,369
Why don't you just give
me a bottle of Scotch...

995
00:58:23,544 --> 00:58:25,705
and a handgun to blow
my fucking head off?

996
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,052
Are we done with this
psychiatry bullshit?

997
00:58:28,053 --> 00:58:29,053
You know what? You can leave!

998
00:58:29,054 --> 00:58:31,449
What did fuck did I just put myself
through? I'm fucking out of here.

999
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:34,104
And what if that was
a legitimate threat?

1000
00:58:34,105 --> 00:58:36,056
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

1001
00:58:37,424 --> 00:58:39,051
Fuck.

1002
00:58:47,768 --> 00:58:50,430
Why is the last patient of the
day always the hardest one?

1003
00:58:50,604 --> 00:58:52,401
It's 'cause you're tired and you
don't give a shit.

1004
00:58:52,573 --> 00:58:54,473
-It's not supernatural.
-Listen.

1005
00:58:54,642 --> 00:58:57,309
Listen. You know, I'm
not just somebody that

1006
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:59,739
you have to see or
they put you in jail.

1007
00:58:59,914 --> 00:59:02,781
Okay? I mean, if you're in
distress, I will help you.

1008
00:59:04,818 --> 00:59:06,376
What's this?

1009
00:59:06,854 --> 00:59:09,687
It's my card. And a
prescription for 20 lorazepam.

1010
00:59:09,857 --> 00:59:11,415
Yeah?

1011
00:59:11,592 --> 00:59:13,219
Is it enough to commit suicide?

1012
00:59:13,794 --> 00:59:16,285
Maybe it is. Alright? Okay?

1013
00:59:16,463 --> 00:59:18,624
Have I done my job up to
your goddamn standards?

1014
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,618
Because according to
my standards, you

1015
00:59:20,619 --> 00:59:22,530
fit the model of
drug-seeking behaviour.

1016
00:59:22,703 --> 00:59:24,638
You know, and too
damn bad if you don't

1017
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:26,332
like my initial clinical reaction.

1018
00:59:26,507 --> 00:59:27,769
Thank you.

1019
00:59:29,009 --> 00:59:31,569
I'm transferring you
to another counsellor.

1020
00:59:31,745 --> 00:59:33,736
-Good.
-Okay.

1021
00:59:35,382 --> 00:59:37,475
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

1022
00:59:44,325 --> 00:59:47,192
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

1023
00:59:47,361 --> 00:59:48,726
Come on in.

1024
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:53,823
Our target is a major
transaction of microprocessors.

1025
00:59:54,001 --> 00:59:55,593
Yes, those.

1026
00:59:55,769 --> 00:59:57,726
I don't know what they
are, you don't know

1027
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:59,500
what they are. Who
gives a fuck? Cash.

1028
00:59:59,673 --> 01:00:02,198
Lots of cash is gonna change
hands inside a building...

1029
01:00:02,376 --> 01:00:04,640
that we have under AV
surveillance close-by.

1030
01:00:04,845 --> 01:00:06,602
I know this off-site location
is not the best,

1031
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,406
but we had very little
time to set up.

1032
01:00:08,582 --> 01:00:09,981
You guys know anything about this?

1033
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:10,982
No.

1034
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:13,678
Sullivan's team will ID the bad
guys and listen in on the phones.

1035
01:00:13,854 --> 01:00:15,219
Our unit will not take action.

1036
01:00:15,856 --> 01:00:17,895
I repeat, not take
action, until a man

1037
01:00:17,896 --> 01:00:19,724
that Captain Queenan has inside their operation

1038
01:00:19,725 --> 01:00:22,088
verifies the transaction.
Are we clear?

1039
01:00:22,262 --> 01:00:26,221
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

1040
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:30,002
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

1041
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:32,695
we are going to get
him. Let's go to work.

1042
01:00:32,873 --> 01:00:35,637
Alright, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

1043
01:00:35,683 --> 01:00:38,141
-Hey.
-Sorry to get you at the last minute, but things leak.

1044
01:00:38,312 --> 01:00:40,337
This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

1045
01:00:40,514 --> 01:00:42,689
I'm gonna smoke. You
don't smoke do you? What, you one of

1046
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:45,076
those fitness freaks,
huh? Go fuck yourself.

1047
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,317
-Hi, Dad?
-Yes.

1048
01:00:52,493 --> 01:00:54,654
Yeah, something big
came up at work.

1049
01:00:54,828 --> 01:00:56,696
I'm not gonna be home for supper.

1050
01:00:56,697 --> 01:00:57,697
Too bad.

1051
01:00:58,165 --> 01:01:00,065
Your mother worked
all goddamn day.

1052
01:01:00,367 --> 01:01:03,734
We'll just have to sit down
without you and your friends.

1053
01:01:03,904 --> 01:01:06,065
Oh, no, my friends
are still coming.

1054
01:01:09,543 --> 01:01:12,376
So we'll just... I'll just see
you for lunch instead tomorrow.

1055
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,043
Your mother will be proud.

1056
01:01:15,215 --> 01:01:17,080
Alright, thanks, Pop. Bye.

1057
01:01:17,384 --> 01:01:19,875
The readiness is all.

1058
01:01:20,654 --> 01:01:24,522
You know the players.
Call the game.

1059
01:01:26,293 --> 01:01:27,453
Thank you.

1060
01:01:28,696 --> 01:01:30,630
-You ready?
-Is your highness...

1061
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:33,961
gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

1062
01:01:34,134 --> 01:01:36,864
What have you got to confess
to that anointed paederast?

1063
01:01:37,037 --> 01:01:39,972
A confessional seal, these days...

1064
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:41,767
I'm not so sure.

1065
01:01:46,747 --> 01:01:49,477
Piece of cake. He'll operate the cameras. You
ID the guys and log them.

1066
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:52,147
All cell-phone signals are
under surveillance...

1067
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,083
through the courtesy of our
federal friends over there.

1068
01:01:57,591 --> 01:02:01,391
Patriot Act, Patriot Act. I
love it, I love it, I love it.

1069
01:02:04,598 --> 01:02:05,758
Keep an eye on this one.

1070
01:02:40,968 --> 01:02:43,198
Alright, here we go.

1071
01:02:45,873 --> 01:02:48,171
There's Costello. Mr. French.

1072
01:02:48,442 --> 01:02:50,171
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

1073
01:02:50,544 --> 01:02:52,375
and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

1074
01:02:58,952 --> 01:03:01,420
Time is 10:46.

1075
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:05,549
Alright, turn off
your cell phones.

1076
01:03:05,726 --> 01:03:08,718
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

1077
01:03:31,485 --> 01:03:34,511
-We have a blind spot.
-Why do we have a blind spot?

1078
01:03:34,688 --> 01:03:36,588
We had two hours'
notice. Fuckin' two hours.

1079
01:03:36,757 --> 01:03:39,487
-Fuck you think this is, NASA?
-It never crossed my mind.

1080
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,924
Have you got a camera in the back?

1081
01:03:41,925 --> 01:03:42,925
What back?

1082
01:03:49,469 --> 01:03:52,097
-How you going, Robert?
-Good, Mr. Costello.

1083
01:03:52,506 --> 01:03:56,135
I wanna tell you, at least two of
these gents have machine guns.

1084
01:04:09,857 --> 01:04:12,382
He's from the Chinese government.
He's just scared shitless.

1085
01:04:12,826 --> 01:04:15,693
Government man. Scared.

1086
01:04:16,096 --> 01:04:19,793
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

1087
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:23,368
to come to a business
transaction...

1088
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:25,433
with automatic weapons.

1089
01:04:32,279 --> 01:04:35,248
For his own good, tell Bruce
Lee and the Karate Kids...

1090
01:04:35,415 --> 01:04:38,043
none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

1091
01:04:38,218 --> 01:04:41,517
Because here, in this country...

1092
01:04:41,955 --> 01:04:44,480
it don't add inches to your dick.

1093
01:04:44,658 --> 01:04:46,853
You get a life sentence for it.

1094
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:05,284
Yeah maybe if we had some of that
Homeland Security money

1095
01:05:05,285 --> 01:05:07,547
like some fuckin' douchebags
I could mention...

1096
01:05:07,548 --> 01:05:08,548
Any calls?

1097
01:05:08,549 --> 01:05:10,109
They turned off their cell phones.

1098
01:05:10,617 --> 01:05:12,812
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

1099
01:05:12,986 --> 01:05:15,386
Eight hundred and seven
phones are live in this area.

1100
01:05:15,555 --> 01:05:17,022
Then narrow the area.

1101
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:19,750
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

1102
01:05:19,927 --> 01:05:21,827
Why the fuck did they turn
their phones off?

1103
01:05:21,995 --> 01:05:24,222
Wait. There's still one phone up.

1104
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,223
Where?

1105
01:05:37,144 --> 01:05:39,009
The buyers are there.

1106
01:05:42,683 --> 01:05:46,050
You know, direct contact with your
guys would have its advantages.

1107
01:05:46,219 --> 01:05:47,709
Not to my guy.

1108
01:05:48,255 --> 01:05:50,985
This is unbelievable. Who put
the fucking cameras in this place?

1109
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:52,620
Oh, who the fuck are you?

1110
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,288
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

1111
01:05:59,433 --> 01:06:02,766
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

1112
01:06:02,936 --> 01:06:07,202
they'd better shape up and
show me 1 million dollars.

1113
01:06:12,346 --> 01:06:15,782
What we generally do,
in this country...

1114
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:18,079
is one guy...

1115
01:06:18,385 --> 01:06:20,444
brings the items...

1116
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:22,918
and the other guy...

1117
01:06:23,223 --> 01:06:24,520
pays him.

1118
01:06:28,261 --> 01:06:30,320
No tickee...

1119
01:06:30,931 --> 01:06:33,161
no laundry.

1120
01:06:41,608 --> 01:06:43,701
Go ahead, Fitz.

1121
01:06:59,826 --> 01:07:02,818
Cars are moving, but did
you see anybody come out?

1122
01:07:04,531 --> 01:07:06,590
Please tell me those
cars aren't empty.

1123
01:07:06,767 --> 01:07:09,240
I mean, Jesus fucking
Christ, please tell

1124
01:07:09,241 --> 01:07:11,830
me that those Chinamen's
cars aren't empty.

1125
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:19,345
They didn't figure we had a navy.

1126
01:07:25,185 --> 01:07:27,415
Did you put a camera in the back?

1127
01:07:29,122 --> 01:07:31,352
Can I talk to you for
a second, please?

1128
01:07:33,693 --> 01:07:35,923
You stupid fucking hard-on.

1129
01:07:36,763 --> 01:07:38,287
You fucked this whole thing up.

1130
01:07:38,465 --> 01:07:41,730
What the fuck did you do, you
cocksucker? Let go of me.

1131
01:07:41,902 --> 01:07:45,167
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass you hear me?!

1132
01:07:45,505 --> 01:07:47,700
Why don't we just meet up sweetheart?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

1133
01:07:47,874 --> 01:07:50,104
I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on the phone.

1134
01:07:50,277 --> 01:07:53,269
Queenan had a funeral to go to, okay?
This is my shift. Just calm down.

1135
01:07:53,447 --> 01:07:55,472
Why shouldn't I get on
a fucking plane, huh?

1136
01:07:55,649 --> 01:07:58,277
Meet up? Meet...?! You actually
want me dead?

1137
01:07:58,452 --> 01:08:01,285
Look, there is a rat in your
unit. That is a fact, alright?

1138
01:08:01,455 --> 01:08:02,922
-Where's Queenan?
-He's not here.

1139
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:06,150
They knew you had cameras in the
building. They knew everything.

1140
01:08:06,326 --> 01:08:09,489
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

1141
01:08:09,663 --> 01:08:11,727
Yeah, how do we do
that, Mr. fucking "Genius Who

1142
01:08:11,728 --> 01:08:13,690
Didn't Even Graduate
From the Academy?"

1143
01:08:13,867 --> 01:08:15,533
Disinform alright? Let it slip to SIU that

1144
01:08:15,534 --> 01:08:17,394
you have a sealed
wiretap warrant...

1145
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:19,771
for Costello's
apartment. Don't tell

1146
01:08:19,772 --> 01:08:22,031
anyone in our division,
but tell SIU.

1147
01:08:22,209 --> 01:08:24,677
Flush it down the pipe, and see
if it comes out on my end alright?

1148
01:08:24,845 --> 01:08:26,710
That's what we do
first. We narrow it down.

1149
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,940
-Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
-He's not here alright?

1150
01:08:30,117 --> 01:08:33,211
You wanna meet up or you got
something real, call me back.

1151
01:08:39,226 --> 01:08:42,389
Changing your life radically.

1152
01:08:42,562 --> 01:08:44,962
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

1153
01:08:45,132 --> 01:08:47,157
-Right?
-Yeah.

1154
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:52,436
How long you been with this guy?

1155
01:08:53,273 --> 01:08:55,901
-My boyfriend?
-Yeah.

1156
01:08:58,612 --> 01:09:01,809
-Four months. Almost four months.
-Four months.

1157
01:09:01,982 --> 01:09:03,506
Do you love him?

1158
01:09:05,685 --> 01:09:08,153
It's a pretty serious
relationship, yeah.

1159
01:09:08,321 --> 01:09:09,686
It's very serious.

1160
01:09:09,856 --> 01:09:13,553
Is he a headcase like
me or? I'm just curious.

1161
01:09:14,161 --> 01:09:16,186
No more than I am.

1162
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:18,821
I know that it's a
serious relationship.

1163
01:09:19,466 --> 01:09:21,696
I know there are ups
and downs. Right?

1164
01:09:21,868 --> 01:09:24,200
People have doubts and problems.

1165
01:09:24,671 --> 01:09:28,334
Well, not problems, but doubts.

1166
01:09:31,077 --> 01:09:32,666
What would you do if he was

1167
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:35,843
standing right there
and he saw us huh?

1168
01:09:39,853 --> 01:09:43,220
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

1169
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:46,917
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

1170
01:09:47,093 --> 01:09:49,186
Right? We talked about that.

1171
01:09:54,734 --> 01:09:56,702
-Morning.
-Good morning.

1172
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:59,295
Want a French doughnut?

1173
01:09:59,806 --> 01:10:01,273
Yeah.

1174
01:10:02,709 --> 01:10:04,301
-Hey, can I lookit?
-Yeah.

1175
01:10:04,711 --> 01:10:05,939
Sure.

1176
01:10:08,582 --> 01:10:10,553
Alright, we're not
having this out.

1177
01:10:10,554 --> 01:10:11,554
What?

1178
01:10:11,555 --> 01:10:13,545
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

1179
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,487
Look, I respect who you are...

1180
01:10:15,655 --> 01:10:17,816
just, you know, not
in the living room.

1181
01:10:17,991 --> 01:10:19,583
We might have company.

1182
01:10:19,759 --> 01:10:21,750
-Company?
-Yeah, company.

1183
01:10:22,495 --> 01:10:24,854
Hey, now, why do you
work for the state?

1184
01:10:24,855 --> 01:10:25,896
Why not? You do.

1185
01:10:26,066 --> 01:10:27,939
No, what you do. The
degrees and all,

1186
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,763
everything you got.
You're hot shit.

1187
01:10:30,136 --> 01:10:31,136
Yeah?

1188
01:10:32,112 --> 01:10:34,152
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counsellor?

1189
01:10:34,172 --> 01:10:37,699
Because I believe
in public service.

1190
01:10:39,438 --> 01:10:41,122
So now you're gonna
fuck with me? So

1191
01:10:41,123 --> 01:10:42,805
now you're gonna be
ridiculous, huh?

1192
01:10:43,575 --> 01:10:45,426
No, don't start with me. Don't...

1193
01:10:45,427 --> 01:10:46,427
Hey.

1194
01:10:46,778 --> 01:10:49,338
Ah, fuck with the
fucking phone. Stop it!

1195
01:10:49,514 --> 01:10:51,209
-The phone.
-Forget the phone.

1196
01:10:51,383 --> 01:10:52,850
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

1197
01:10:53,118 --> 01:10:55,245
This is your first phone
call in the new house.

1198
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:57,615
You live here now.
You're a resident.

1199
01:10:59,591 --> 01:11:01,320
Mayor Sullivan's office.

1200
01:11:01,493 --> 01:11:04,291
Put Colin on the phone right now.

1201
01:11:04,763 --> 01:11:06,060
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1202
01:11:06,231 --> 01:11:07,755
What?

1203
01:11:08,233 --> 01:11:10,360
I think it's a guy with...

1204
01:11:10,535 --> 01:11:14,528
-It's like a cancer guy.
-Hello.

1205
01:11:14,706 --> 01:11:17,869
What the fuck is it with
you and your phone, huh?

1206
01:11:19,711 --> 01:11:21,076
Something for work.

1207
01:11:21,246 --> 01:11:25,114
Hey. Uh, nothing, nothing, nothing. It
went dead. I don't know, I get...

1208
01:11:25,317 --> 01:11:27,581
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

1209
01:11:27,753 --> 01:11:30,381
Remember I told you that we
were... She was gonna move in?

1210
01:11:30,555 --> 01:11:32,250
-Yeah.
-She moved in.

1211
01:11:32,424 --> 01:11:33,952
You better get organized, quick.

1212
01:11:33,953 --> 01:11:36,155
Hey, last time I checked,
I tipped you off...

1213
01:11:36,328 --> 01:11:38,159
and you're not in jail.

1214
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:41,731
-Are you listening to me?
-Yeah.

1215
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:45,631
Do you like Little Miss
Thing sucking on your cock?

1216
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:49,705
Yes. Yes, I do.

1217
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:51,502
So earn it.

1218
01:11:52,377 --> 01:11:54,436
I'm getting the feeling...

1219
01:11:54,613 --> 01:11:56,513
we got a cop in my crew.

1220
01:11:56,815 --> 01:11:59,215
Yeah, I know, I'm kind of
getting that feeling too.

1221
01:11:59,384 --> 01:12:02,182
He's one of yours. Inside.

1222
01:12:02,354 --> 01:12:03,446
Have you seen anything?

1223
01:12:03,622 --> 01:12:05,442
Frank, I got no access to
Queenan's undercover

1224
01:12:05,443 --> 01:12:07,217
files. He and Dignam
run the snitches.

1225
01:12:07,392 --> 01:12:08,586
-I'm doing my best.
-Your best?!

1226
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,627
What do you think we're in, the
fucking haberdashery business?

1227
01:12:11,797 --> 01:12:13,355
Alright, look, Frank, if you don't relax...

1228
01:12:13,532 --> 01:12:15,517
If you don't relax,
I can't relax.

1229
01:12:15,518 --> 01:12:17,400
Alright? Now, what I
need you to do...

1230
01:12:17,569 --> 01:12:21,027
you get me information on the people who were
with you last night. Your crew.

1231
01:12:21,206 --> 01:12:23,140
Get me social security
numbers, get me...

1232
01:12:23,308 --> 01:12:27,472
-...full names
-Get you? Give you? Who the
fuck do you work for?

1233
01:12:27,646 --> 01:12:29,454
Alright, alright, alright. Frank, Frank.

1234
01:12:29,455 --> 01:12:30,911
Frank! Alright. I'm sorry.

1235
01:12:30,912 --> 01:12:34,280
I didn't...If you could, please. What I
need are SS numbers, DOBs...

1236
01:12:34,453 --> 01:12:36,744
just all the pedigree
information so I can

1237
01:12:36,745 --> 01:12:38,981
run it on my end and
we can ID the prick.

1238
01:12:39,157 --> 01:12:40,954
If you could just get me
that information...

1239
01:12:41,126 --> 01:12:43,560
what I can do is... I can just ra.....
We're, we're, we're gonna handle it. I can handle it.

1240
01:12:43,728 --> 01:12:45,923
Calm down, or you'll
shoot in your pants.

1241
01:12:46,098 --> 01:12:47,827
I'll get you the
records and whatnot.

1242
01:12:47,999 --> 01:12:51,162
But listen to me, son. Don't
disappoint me on this...

1243
01:12:51,336 --> 01:12:54,635
or some other guy will be
putting their fat cock...

1244
01:12:54,806 --> 01:12:57,297
up Little Miss Freud's ass.

1245
01:13:04,116 --> 01:13:06,482
How are you, Francis?

1246
01:13:11,656 --> 01:13:15,148
-My mother called me Francis.
-I know she did.

1247
01:13:15,327 --> 01:13:18,125
And your father called
you the tumour.

1248
01:13:18,296 --> 01:13:20,958
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

1249
01:13:21,133 --> 01:13:25,126
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
He wasn't around.

1250
01:13:25,303 --> 01:13:27,430
You have a boss that
has a laryngectomy?

1251
01:13:27,606 --> 01:13:31,508
No, no, no. That was a
guy who works for me.

1252
01:13:31,676 --> 01:13:33,667
You're lying to me.

1253
01:13:35,447 --> 01:13:36,812
Not exactly.

1254
01:13:36,982 --> 01:13:40,440
What did you do with the
real microprocessors, Frank?

1255
01:13:40,886 --> 01:13:43,582
Microprocessors.

1256
01:13:44,089 --> 01:13:45,317
Oh, yeah.

1257
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:48,653
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

1258
01:13:48,827 --> 01:13:52,160
at the border carrying some
light sockets or something.

1259
01:13:53,865 --> 01:13:56,698
I can't wait to wipe that
fucking smirk right off of your face.

1260
01:13:57,369 --> 01:14:00,031
Wouldn't you rather
wipe my ass for me?

1261
01:14:00,205 --> 01:14:02,256
Look, there are certain parts
of my job that I'm

1262
01:14:02,257 --> 01:14:04,164
not gonna be able to
talk to you about.

1263
01:14:04,543 --> 01:14:07,257
And I cannot allow
you to jeopardize

1264
01:14:07,258 --> 01:14:09,310
an ongoing investigation...

1265
01:14:09,481 --> 01:14:11,506
or your life.

1266
01:14:12,484 --> 01:14:15,476
No, really, there are things you
don't even wanna know about.

1267
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:17,850
Okay, then just say that.

1268
01:14:19,938 --> 01:14:21,303
Alright, I will.

1269
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:24,101
Oh, that's the movers.

1270
01:14:24,276 --> 01:14:26,039
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

1271
01:14:27,012 --> 01:14:29,173
-Yes.
-Yeah?

1272
01:14:29,348 --> 01:14:32,977
Come on, I'm coming.
It's the worst timing.

1273
01:14:33,419 --> 01:14:35,387
I'm gonna get you.

1274
01:14:36,588 --> 01:14:39,421
If you coulda, you woulda.

1275
01:14:39,692 --> 01:14:43,253
But I guess you like to
go at your own pace.

1276
01:14:43,429 --> 01:14:47,798
Excuse me. Got a date
with some angels.

1277
01:14:55,841 --> 01:14:56,841
Frankie.

1278
01:14:57,776 --> 01:15:00,105
Frankie. Frankie

1279
01:15:00,112 --> 01:15:02,205
Your mother forgives me.

1280
01:15:06,985 --> 01:15:08,850
You take off an armoured
car at the Deda Mall.

1281
01:15:09,021 --> 01:15:11,046
What the fuck you do, you pay
guineas in Providence?!

1282
01:15:11,223 --> 01:15:14,056
-Fucking now I do.
-What the fuck you do?!

1283
01:15:14,226 --> 01:15:16,428
What?! I gotta pay Costello, wait
for him to trade me

1284
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,629
to the FBI? Because
that's what he does.

1285
01:15:18,797 --> 01:15:21,288
FBI? What the fuck you
talking about, FBI?

1286
01:15:24,737 --> 01:15:26,261
Oh my God, is that French out there?

1287
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:28,599
What the fuck did you
just say about the FBI?

1288
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,708
Forget what I said.
I'm fucking high.

1289
01:15:31,376 --> 01:15:33,867
Whatever may be going on in
that very fucking poor...

1290
01:15:34,046 --> 01:15:37,812
very limited brain of yours, I am
not gonna hurt you, alright?

1291
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:39,693
Just tell me what
you just fucking said.

1292
01:15:39,694 --> 01:15:40,694
Forget it.

1293
01:15:40,695 --> 01:15:42,488
I'm high. I'm fucking
high. I must be high.

1294
01:15:42,489 --> 01:15:44,321
I would never say what
you thought I said.

1295
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:46,157
Oh! Fuck!

1296
01:15:46,325 --> 01:15:49,624
Now, what the fuck did
you just fucking say?

1297
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,800
Why do you think he
never gets busted?

1298
01:15:51,801 --> 01:15:53,754
Costello's a protected
FBI informant.

1299
01:15:53,932 --> 01:15:56,423
He'll trade you out.

1300
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,498
I thought I was supposed
to go into shock.

1301
01:15:59,671 --> 01:16:02,765
I'm not in shock.
It fucking hurts.

1302
01:16:02,941 --> 01:16:05,933
It fucking hurts.

1303
01:16:13,452 --> 01:16:15,682
Hey. It's me.

1304
01:16:15,854 --> 01:16:18,186
-What are you doing here?
-Come here.

1305
01:16:20,392 --> 01:16:23,156
Costello's giving
people up to the FBI.

1306
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:24,403
The FBI?

1307
01:16:24,404 --> 01:16:27,628
He is giving information
to the FBI.

1308
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,166
He's a protected
fucking informant.

1309
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,451
I mean, aren't they
always trying to make

1310
01:16:32,452 --> 01:16:34,567
it a federal case and
it never gets made?

1311
01:16:35,741 --> 01:16:38,369
Go around the back. I'll
open the door. Go on.

1312
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,447
-Here's some ice water.
-Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1313
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:52,217
That's my son, Patrick.

1314
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:55,652
-Goes to Notre Dame.
-Oh, yeah?

1315
01:16:55,828 --> 01:16:57,375
My wife's asleep but she left some

1316
01:16:57,376 --> 01:16:59,195
supper out. You want
something to eat?

1317
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:00,854
No. No, thanks.

1318
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,628
Yeah, come on, man. You have some
supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

1319
01:17:04,803 --> 01:17:06,430
Come on.

1320
01:17:41,974 --> 01:17:43,202
You want some coke?

1321
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,647
There it is.

1322
01:17:51,283 --> 01:17:53,774
Don't move 'til you're numb.

1323
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,734
Come on. Get inside.

1324
01:18:13,071 --> 01:18:14,902
Boss wants your real name...

1325
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:18,599
your social and licence number,
your bank account numbers.

1326
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:20,870
I don't have a bank account.

1327
01:18:21,046 --> 01:18:22,451
I'm a cash business myself.

1328
01:18:22,452 --> 01:18:24,243
What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

1329
01:18:24,416 --> 01:18:26,307
Just fill the fucking
paper in. Your

1330
01:18:26,308 --> 01:18:28,352
real name and all
your account numbers.

1331
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,351
Then we wait here.

1332
01:18:31,189 --> 01:18:33,919
-You're shitting me.
-No, I ain't.

1333
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,431
Put the forms in there.

1334
01:18:50,943 --> 01:18:53,309
I don't know if this is
how you spell citizens.

1335
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:56,140
But fuck it, you know?

1336
01:18:56,648 --> 01:18:59,116
No, no, no, no, no. Come here.

1337
01:19:04,089 --> 01:19:06,080
What, are you fucking
retarded or something?

1338
01:19:06,258 --> 01:19:08,419
That ain't fucking right.

1339
01:19:08,593 --> 01:19:09,855
Are you kidding me?

1340
01:19:10,028 --> 01:19:11,325
Look at this. Look.

1341
01:19:12,097 --> 01:19:14,088
Citizens. Look.

1342
01:19:14,433 --> 01:19:15,764
Billy, he said to stay here.

1343
01:19:16,134 --> 01:19:18,659
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without getting a tetanus shot.

1344
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:20,202
Where the fuck are you going?

1345
01:19:20,372 --> 01:19:24,536
I'm not staying, alright?
You can tell him I said that.

1346
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,887
-Hey.
-Hi.

1347
01:19:47,933 --> 01:19:49,992
-It's pouring out there.
-Yeah.

1348
01:19:56,908 --> 01:19:58,773
Look...if...

1349
01:19:58,944 --> 01:20:00,707
-if this is inappropriate, I...
-No.

1350
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:03,507
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

1351
01:20:06,351 --> 01:20:08,319
So you moving out
or you moving in?

1352
01:20:09,087 --> 01:20:11,248
I've still got three
weeks left on the lease.

1353
01:20:20,432 --> 01:20:22,093
That's me.

1354
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:26,660
Yeah, I know.

1355
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:36,441
-Hedging your bets?
-No. No.

1356
01:20:36,815 --> 01:20:38,214
You have to choose.

1357
01:20:38,383 --> 01:20:41,045
-You have to make a...
-A decision.

1358
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:44,620
A decision. And, and, you know, you
have to stick by what you choose.

1359
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:47,054
-You have to...
-Move in with your boyfriend?

1360
01:20:47,225 --> 01:20:49,819
Yes. Otherwise it's...

1361
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:53,663
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

1362
01:21:04,476 --> 01:21:07,167
I have to say your
vulnerability is

1363
01:21:07,168 --> 01:21:09,709
really freaking me out right now.

1364
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,581
Is it real?

1365
01:21:20,492 --> 01:21:22,221
I think so.

1366
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,998
You don't have any cats.

1367
01:21:30,168 --> 01:21:31,726
No.

1368
01:21:32,704 --> 01:21:34,467
I like that.

1369
01:22:46,778 --> 01:22:47,972
I don't get it.

1370
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:53,510
Well...we are all convinced that
Costello has at least...

1371
01:22:53,685 --> 01:22:56,848
one mole inside the Special
Investigations Unit.

1372
01:22:57,022 --> 01:23:01,254
You will investigate
everybody and anybody.

1373
01:23:01,426 --> 01:23:05,590
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

1374
01:23:05,764 --> 01:23:07,562
We looked at all
possible candidates.

1375
01:23:07,563 --> 01:23:09,029
You have an immaculate record.

1376
01:23:09,201 --> 01:23:12,534
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

1377
01:23:12,704 --> 01:23:14,171
I have an immaculate record.

1378
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,305
How is your wedding coming along?

1379
01:23:17,475 --> 01:23:19,909
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

1380
01:23:20,445 --> 01:23:22,845
-Ooo. That's outstanding.
-Yeah.

1381
01:23:23,014 --> 01:23:25,141
Marriage is an important
part of getting ahead.

1382
01:23:25,317 --> 01:23:28,218
Lets people know you're not a
homo. Married guy is more stable.

1383
01:23:28,386 --> 01:23:31,048
People see the ring, they think at
least someone can stand the son of a bitch.

1384
01:23:31,223 --> 01:23:33,254
Ladies see the ring,
they know immediately you must

1385
01:23:33,255 --> 01:23:35,284
have some cash and
your cock must work.

1386
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,528
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

1387
01:23:38,964 --> 01:23:41,694
-I'm glad to hear that.
-Yeah. Thank you.

1388
01:24:29,781 --> 01:24:33,444
Be dirty, be dirty.

1389
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:37,815
Yeah...

1390
01:24:43,028 --> 01:24:45,758
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

1391
01:24:46,631 --> 01:24:49,657
-See anything you like, Col?
-I almost fucking shot you.

1392
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:51,910
I mean, you're not indulging in
self-abuse, are you?

1393
01:24:51,911 --> 01:24:52,911
Sit down.

1394
01:24:52,912 --> 01:24:54,935
I hope you're not
turning into one of

1395
01:24:54,936 --> 01:24:56,965
them sob sisters who
wants to get caught.

1396
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:59,037
You're not cracking up, are you?

1397
01:24:59,978 --> 01:25:02,538
-I don't crack up.
-Pick a place like this...

1398
01:25:02,714 --> 01:25:04,614
where any cop could
see you. Jesus.

1399
01:25:04,783 --> 01:25:07,946
If this is such a fucking
bad idea why'd you show up?

1400
01:25:08,553 --> 01:25:10,214
I own the place.

1401
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:15,118
Why am I not fucking surprised?

1402
01:25:16,461 --> 01:25:18,422
Alright, lookit, I
gotta tell you...

1403
01:25:18,423 --> 01:25:20,192
You're getting reassigned. I know.

1404
01:25:20,899 --> 01:25:22,366
How the fuck do you know that?

1405
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:24,832
-Where'd they put you?
-Hey, Frank.

1406
01:25:25,003 --> 01:25:28,564
I gotta find myself.

1407
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,332
You're telling me, sonny boy.

1408
01:25:30,942 --> 01:25:33,342
I gotta find the guy you
got in the department.

1409
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:35,894
With everybody
looking up their own

1410
01:25:35,895 --> 01:25:37,708
ass and you looking
for yourself...

1411
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:39,941
I put my money on
nobody finds nothing.

1412
01:25:40,118 --> 01:25:44,555
I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.

1413
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:46,554
-Right now.
-Collie...

1414
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:49,125
laying low is not what I do.

1415
01:25:49,294 --> 01:25:51,956
Alright, fucking Big Daddy
Frank. Fucking perfect.

1416
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:54,360
What good am I to you if
you don't listen to me?

1417
01:25:54,532 --> 01:25:56,124
What good am I if
you don't listen?

1418
01:26:01,272 --> 01:26:04,070
Queenan is compartmentalising.
He's splitting everything up.

1419
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:05,903
Alright? He's fucking smart. You know this.

1420
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:09,672
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

1421
01:26:13,218 --> 01:26:14,378
Okay.

1422
01:26:18,223 --> 01:26:21,090
But Colin, I hope I won't
have to remind you...

1423
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:23,484
that if you don't find
that cheese-eating

1424
01:26:23,485 --> 01:26:25,286
rat bastard in your department...

1425
01:26:25,463 --> 01:26:29,695
most likely, it won't be
me who suffers for it.

1426
01:26:30,635 --> 01:26:33,126
Now, why would you have
to remind me of that?

1427
01:26:33,304 --> 01:26:35,887
Would I be any good
at what I do if

1428
01:26:35,888 --> 01:26:38,469
I didn't fucking
already know that?

1429
01:26:38,643 --> 01:26:41,077
Frank, you gotta trust me.

1430
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:43,979
Alright? Just, just trust me, Frank.

1431
01:26:45,216 --> 01:26:47,588
Hey, it fucking
involves lying and I'm

1432
01:26:47,589 --> 01:26:49,778
pretty fucking good
at that. Right?

1433
01:26:49,954 --> 01:26:51,615
Right?

1434
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:54,418
Maybe because it's
always been so easy...

1435
01:26:54,592 --> 01:26:56,672
for me to get cunt that I never

1436
01:26:56,673 --> 01:26:59,222
understood jerking
off in a theatre.

1437
01:27:05,737 --> 01:27:07,295
Christ.

1438
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:11,966
Who knows what's easy?

1439
01:27:12,744 --> 01:27:17,408
Colin, I know you'll
take care of business.

1440
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,627
Shit!

1441
01:28:42,534 --> 01:28:43,967
Fuck.

1442
01:30:02,113 --> 01:30:03,603
Hey, how you doing?

1443
01:30:03,781 --> 01:30:05,942
Hi, Darlene, hi.

1444
01:30:10,121 --> 01:30:11,986
-That's it for me.
-Yeah, see you.

1445
01:30:12,156 --> 01:30:13,851
Have a good one.

1446
01:30:36,981 --> 01:30:39,142
I smell a rat.

1447
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:47,018
Jesus Christ.

1448
01:30:48,092 --> 01:30:49,684
You got a girlfriend?

1449
01:30:51,629 --> 01:30:53,290
No.

1450
01:30:53,464 --> 01:30:55,523
No, no. Why, why, what
does that matter?

1451
01:30:57,268 --> 01:30:58,633
It depends.

1452
01:31:00,838 --> 01:31:04,467
I'm sure by now you know...

1453
01:31:05,076 --> 01:31:08,204
I got an informer in my outfit.

1454
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:10,408
Cop.

1455
01:31:10,581 --> 01:31:15,848
Staties, Boston Police
Department, I'm not, uh, sure.

1456
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:18,181
Jesus Christ.

1457
01:31:19,791 --> 01:31:22,419
You, you sure it's not the FBI?

1458
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:26,762
It ain't the FBI.

1459
01:31:27,799 --> 01:31:29,733
Ex-wife.

1460
01:31:31,035 --> 01:31:33,094
Old girlfriend.

1461
01:31:34,472 --> 01:31:36,406
Or stupid.

1462
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:40,942
That is what brings you
down in this business.

1463
01:31:41,112 --> 01:31:42,807
Stupid, huh?

1464
01:31:43,481 --> 01:31:45,381
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

1465
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:54,990
You know, past days, situation
like this, I kill everybody.

1466
01:31:55,727 --> 01:31:58,161
Everybody who works for me.

1467
01:31:58,629 --> 01:32:00,927
Right. You know, Frank...

1468
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,192
I, uh, I look around at
your other guys...

1469
01:32:04,001 --> 01:32:06,936
I mean, they're all
murderers, right? Right?

1470
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:10,768
And I think, Could I do murder?

1471
01:32:12,844 --> 01:32:16,007
And all I can answer myself is:

1472
01:32:17,515 --> 01:32:19,540
'What's the difference?'

1473
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:22,616
Give them up to the Almighty.

1474
01:32:23,154 --> 01:32:25,850
You see, that's my
point, you know?

1475
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:31,118
You accuse me once,
I put up with it.

1476
01:32:31,295 --> 01:32:32,626
You accuse me twice...

1477
01:32:34,265 --> 01:32:36,165
I quit.

1478
01:32:36,768 --> 01:32:38,970
You pressure me to
fear for my life and I

1479
01:32:38,971 --> 01:32:41,171
will put a fucking
bullet in your head...

1480
01:32:41,339 --> 01:32:44,274
as if you were anybody else. Okay?

1481
01:32:55,419 --> 01:32:59,082
You got something
you wanna ask me?

1482
01:33:01,225 --> 01:33:05,252
Look, you're 70 years old,
Frank. I'm just saying, okay?

1483
01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:08,428
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1484
01:33:08,599 --> 01:33:10,291
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1485
01:33:10,292 --> 01:33:11,292
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1486
01:33:11,293 --> 01:33:13,400
As for running drugs, what the fuck
are you doing? What are you doing?

1487
01:33:13,571 --> 01:33:15,369
You don't need the
money or the pain

1488
01:33:15,370 --> 01:33:17,166
in the ass. And they
will catch you.

1489
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:19,468
I haven't needed the money...

1490
01:33:19,644 --> 01:33:23,774
since I took Archie's milk
money in the third grade.

1491
01:33:23,948 --> 01:33:27,213
Tell you the truth, I don't
need pussy any more, either.

1492
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:30,517
But I like it.

1493
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:34,453
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

1494
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:37,458
I got this rat...

1495
01:33:37,628 --> 01:33:41,928
this gnawing, cheese-eating,
fucking rat...

1496
01:33:42,099 --> 01:33:44,499
and it brings up questions.

1497
01:33:44,669 --> 01:33:48,662
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

1498
01:33:49,907 --> 01:33:51,738
Girlfriend...

1499
01:33:53,578 --> 01:33:58,447
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

1500
01:33:59,217 --> 01:34:01,879
Social-security numbers.

1501
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:04,988
-Yeah.
-Everybody's fucking numbers.

1502
01:34:05,156 --> 01:34:07,954
Is there something that you
just wanna go ahead and ask me?

1503
01:34:08,125 --> 01:34:10,525
'Cause I'll give you the
fucking answer, alright?

1504
01:34:10,695 --> 01:34:12,629
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

1505
01:34:12,797 --> 01:34:16,096
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

1506
01:34:16,267 --> 01:34:17,666
I'm not the fucking rat.

1507
01:34:18,769 --> 01:34:21,101
Start with you agree
there is a rat.

1508
01:34:22,006 --> 01:34:23,530
You said there is one, alright?

1509
01:34:23,708 --> 01:34:25,403
I base most of what
I do on the idea

1510
01:34:25,404 --> 01:34:27,235
that you're pretty fucking
good at what you do.

1511
01:34:27,411 --> 01:34:29,504
Sure. Sure, Will.

1512
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:34,174
You, William. What would you do?

1513
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:40,714
Frank, how many of these guys...

1514
01:34:40,892 --> 01:34:43,292
have been with you long
enough to be disgruntled huh?

1515
01:34:43,461 --> 01:34:46,430
Think about it. You don't
pay much, you know.

1516
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:49,566
It's almost a fucking
feudal enterprise.

1517
01:34:49,734 --> 01:34:53,261
The question is, and this
is the only question...

1518
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:58,599
who thinks that they can do
what you do better than you?

1519
01:34:59,543 --> 01:35:02,706
The only one who could
do what I do is me.

1520
01:35:03,981 --> 01:35:07,417
Lot of people had to
die for me to be me.

1521
01:35:09,921 --> 01:35:11,946
You wanna be me?

1522
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:18,322
I probably could be you. Yeah.

1523
01:35:18,496 --> 01:35:19,986
Yeah, I know that much.

1524
01:35:21,299 --> 01:35:24,359
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

1525
01:35:24,535 --> 01:35:26,799
I don't wanna be you.

1526
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:32,742
Heavy lies the crown...
sort of thing.

1527
01:35:33,244 --> 01:35:34,677
Yeah.

1528
01:35:35,213 --> 01:35:36,213
Francis.

1529
01:35:36,214 --> 01:35:37,981
I'm out of here. You'll have to
set the alarm...

1530
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:40,803
Yeah, alright. I'll
see you at Christmas.

1531
01:35:40,804 --> 01:35:42,245
Alright. Good night.

1532
01:35:44,755 --> 01:35:47,622
You know what I like
about restaurants?

1533
01:35:47,792 --> 01:35:49,657
The fucking food? I
don't know. What?

1534
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:54,063
You learn a lot
watching things eat.

1535
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,632
There's a boat coming
up Gloucester.

1536
01:35:59,603 --> 01:36:02,436
French will give you all
the details. Don't forget.

1537
01:36:02,606 --> 01:36:05,769
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

1538
01:36:09,947 --> 01:36:12,281
In the future, I tell you to do a

1539
01:36:12,282 --> 01:36:15,180
thing, you fucking
do it. You got that?

1540
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:18,284
I got it. Okay?

1541
01:36:20,658 --> 01:36:22,216
Excuse me...

1542
01:36:22,393 --> 01:36:25,055
-French, I forgot my...
-Okay, Francis.

1543
01:36:25,229 --> 01:36:26,229
Cigarette.

1544
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,532
Eat something.

1545
01:36:40,177 --> 01:36:41,177
Problem?

1546
01:36:41,345 --> 01:36:43,204
Yeah, I got a problem.
I run rat fucks

1547
01:36:43,205 --> 01:36:44,872
like you, okay? I don't like them.

1548
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:47,381
The day you wouldn't take
a promotion, let me know.

1549
01:36:47,551 --> 01:36:49,678
If you'd taken care of
this I wouldn't even be here.

1550
01:36:49,854 --> 01:36:51,461
Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.

1551
01:36:51,462 --> 01:36:53,381
And Imma need the identity
of your undercovers.

1552
01:36:53,557 --> 01:36:55,338
Blow me, alright? Not literally though.
Unfortunately,

1553
01:36:55,339 --> 01:36:57,118
there's no promotion
involved for you.

1554
01:36:57,294 --> 01:36:58,294
Fucking prick.

1555
01:36:58,696 --> 01:37:01,688
-Hi, Captain.
-Look who's here. The prom queen.

1556
01:37:01,866 --> 01:37:04,198
-They are not happy with me.
-What do you expect?

1557
01:37:04,535 --> 01:37:06,404
Everybody knows
you've been assigned

1558
01:37:06,405 --> 01:37:07,868
here to find Costello's rat.

1559
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:11,233
They want to find the
leak as much as you do.

1560
01:37:11,709 --> 01:37:13,766
Like I said, two days
ago, my guy damn

1561
01:37:13,767 --> 01:37:15,770
near found out who
Costello's rat is.

1562
01:37:17,515 --> 01:37:20,416
-But he lost him in the streets.
-Really?

1563
01:37:22,753 --> 01:37:25,202
Well, did he get a
look at the guy?

1564
01:37:25,203 --> 01:37:26,203
No.

1565
01:37:26,204 --> 01:37:28,954
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

1566
01:37:29,126 --> 01:37:30,354
No.

1567
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:35,731
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

1568
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,554
Costello can't do
much business without

1569
01:37:38,555 --> 01:37:40,197
coordinating with his source...

1570
01:37:40,371 --> 01:37:42,236
who is here in SIU.

1571
01:37:44,008 --> 01:37:46,374
Follow Costello.
You'll find his rat.

1572
01:37:54,018 --> 01:37:56,646
You're gonna be looking
at my people...

1573
01:37:56,854 --> 01:37:58,914
going through their
bank statements,

1574
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:01,086
their phone calls and
medical records.

1575
01:38:01,258 --> 01:38:03,719
Don't be surprised if
they don't buy you

1576
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:06,059
a beer or invite you
into their homes.

1577
01:38:07,498 --> 01:38:09,489
Let me get you a coffee.

1578
01:38:12,436 --> 01:38:15,667
If I wasn't with the
Massachusetts State Police...

1579
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:19,242
if I did it full-time,
law school...

1580
01:38:19,844 --> 01:38:22,005
I'd be through it in a year.

1581
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:25,214
If I wasn't a trooper.

1582
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,353
But another city. I
was thinking that.

1583
01:38:33,591 --> 01:38:35,320
Another city.

1584
01:38:35,559 --> 01:38:37,891
Another city, huh?

1585
01:38:39,396 --> 01:38:42,524
Yeah, well, that would
be a clean slate.

1586
01:38:43,067 --> 01:38:46,332
I want you to know, you
don't got to stay.

1587
01:38:48,672 --> 01:38:50,469
If we're not gonna make it...

1588
01:38:50,641 --> 01:38:55,101
it's gotta be you that gets
out, because I'm not capable.

1589
01:38:56,413 --> 01:38:58,767
I'm fucking Irish. I'll
deal with something

1590
01:38:58,768 --> 01:39:00,747
being wrong for the
rest of my life.

1591
01:39:09,527 --> 01:39:13,361
It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.

1592
01:39:31,615 --> 01:39:33,635
Of course I know
how to spot a cop.

1593
01:39:33,636 --> 01:39:34,636
How's that?

1594
01:39:34,637 --> 01:39:37,578
If he's not paying attention
to us, he's a cop.

1595
01:39:37,755 --> 01:39:41,020
Lookit. You see that guy over
there? Right over there.

1596
01:39:41,192 --> 01:39:42,192
Yeah.

1597
01:39:42,359 --> 01:39:46,056
Not paying attention
to us. He's a cop.

1598
01:39:46,697 --> 01:39:49,530
-Okay.
-You get it now, do you?

1599
01:39:55,472 --> 01:39:57,440
-What about this guy?
-Cop.

1600
01:40:00,010 --> 01:40:02,740
Hey, how you doing? What
kind of dog is that?

1601
01:40:04,515 --> 01:40:06,847
She ignored us so
she must be a cop.

1602
01:40:07,017 --> 01:40:11,715
-She's probably the fucking
police commissioner.
-Ha, stop it with your fucking...

1603
01:40:20,831 --> 01:40:24,858
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

1604
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:28,533
I thought I was on for this.

1605
01:40:28,534 --> 01:40:31,234
I changed my mind.
Take the night off.

1606
01:40:31,408 --> 01:40:35,606
Francis, we're ready
for the sushi bar.

1607
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:38,940
-Out the back.
-Jimmy, bring a mop.

1608
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:42,043
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

1609
01:40:42,219 --> 01:40:44,517
-and there's guys that don't.
-And a pail.

1610
01:40:46,924 --> 01:40:48,551
You're a cop.

1611
01:40:49,026 --> 01:40:50,357
What?

1612
01:40:50,527 --> 01:40:52,654
You ignored us, you're a cop.

1613
01:40:53,697 --> 01:40:55,690
We're guessing who
cops are. You know,

1614
01:40:55,691 --> 01:40:57,428
most good-looking women are cops.

1615
01:40:58,869 --> 01:41:01,997
Well, I'm going home, alright?
He's playing with his new guys.

1616
01:41:02,172 --> 01:41:04,106
-See you later, alright?
-(Fitzy) See you later.
-(Delahunt) See you later.

1617
01:41:10,948 --> 01:41:14,180
-He's moving something with all
new guys. A whole new crew.
-Where?

1618
01:41:14,184 --> 01:41:15,645
No, no, I can't tell you what or

1619
01:41:15,646 --> 01:41:17,381
where. It's probably
disinformation.

1620
01:41:17,554 --> 01:41:19,275
Just keep following
him, alright?

1621
01:41:19,276 --> 01:41:20,853
Listen, I need to see you today.

1622
01:41:21,025 --> 01:41:22,458
-Tomorrow.
-No, no, no. Today.

1623
01:41:22,626 --> 01:41:24,992
-You heard nothing about drugs?
-No.

1624
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:28,620
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

1625
01:41:28,799 --> 01:41:30,709
Not a thing. And I
would have. That

1626
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:32,565
information would have come to me.

1627
01:41:34,438 --> 01:41:36,065
It ain't Bill.

1628
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:38,003
No way, he says.

1629
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,887
Follow Costello.
You'll find his rat.

1630
01:41:53,057 --> 01:41:54,581
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

1631
01:41:54,758 --> 01:41:56,736
I want constant surveillance on

1632
01:41:56,737 --> 01:41:59,161
Captain Queenan,
starting right now.

1633
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:01,892
Good. Thank you.

1634
01:42:04,735 --> 01:42:06,651
Can I ask a question,
Sarge? Why the

1635
01:42:06,652 --> 01:42:08,671
fuck are we following
Captain Queenan?

1636
01:42:08,839 --> 01:42:10,739
To find out about the
good Catholic life?

1637
01:42:10,908 --> 01:42:14,071
I have to follow every
lead, however unlikely...

1638
01:42:14,244 --> 01:42:16,177
however fucking painful
it might be to

1639
01:42:16,178 --> 01:42:18,010
your delicate fucking
sensibilities.

1640
01:42:18,182 --> 01:42:20,173
Who told you I had
delicate sensibilities?

1641
01:42:20,351 --> 01:42:22,539
I just don't like it,
Sarge. It don't feel right.

1642
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:23,878
I have reason to believe...

1643
01:42:24,054 --> 01:42:26,784
that Captain Queenan
is Costello's rat.

1644
01:42:26,957 --> 01:42:29,255
So just follow him
and don't get made.

1645
01:42:32,596 --> 01:42:35,463
Sarge, we got the
target coming out.

1646
01:43:11,935 --> 01:43:13,163
Hey. Where are you?

1647
01:43:13,337 --> 01:43:15,305
Look down the car.

1648
01:43:16,707 --> 01:43:19,175
-You got me?
-Yeah, I gotcha.

1649
01:43:19,343 --> 01:43:21,208
Is there any reason you
would have a tail?

1650
01:43:21,712 --> 01:43:23,111
No.

1651
01:43:24,748 --> 01:43:27,581
-Because I think there's...
-Billy, I don't have a tail.

1652
01:43:28,919 --> 01:43:30,894
Get off at the next
stop, alright? South

1653
01:43:30,895 --> 01:43:32,548
Station. You wait
there 10 minutes okay?

1654
01:43:32,723 --> 01:43:34,987
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

1655
01:44:10,928 --> 01:44:14,125
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

1656
01:44:14,298 --> 01:44:16,823
You got that? 344 Wash.

1657
01:44:21,004 --> 01:44:22,631
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

1658
01:44:27,211 --> 01:44:29,873
Building's empty. No tenants here.

1659
01:44:31,381 --> 01:44:34,680
He's got dope coming in. I
don't know where. He...

1660
01:44:35,519 --> 01:44:37,009
He's getting spooky, Captain.

1661
01:44:37,187 --> 01:44:38,313
-What do you mean?
-I just saw him.

1662
01:44:38,489 --> 01:44:41,014
He had blood all over his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

1663
01:44:47,598 --> 01:44:50,032
I don't know what we're
doing here, boys.

1664
01:44:50,667 --> 01:44:53,636
He's not including his regular
guys. But I'mma tell you something.

1665
01:44:53,804 --> 01:44:55,636
Sooner or later he's
gonna find out who

1666
01:44:55,637 --> 01:44:57,331
I am and he's gonna
fucking kill me.

1667
01:44:57,508 --> 01:44:59,257
-I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me.
-Alright.

1668
01:44:59,258 --> 01:45:00,258
Alright, alright!

1669
01:45:06,683 --> 01:45:08,392
I think we got him.
I think Queenan's

1670
01:45:08,393 --> 01:45:09,652
meeting with him right now.

1671
01:45:09,820 --> 01:45:11,515
Alright, alright. Listen to me.

1672
01:45:11,688 --> 01:45:14,486
I'm really sorry for your
trouble. I swear to God I am.

1673
01:45:14,658 --> 01:45:16,336
I'll get you out of
this. I cannot do

1674
01:45:16,337 --> 01:45:17,923
it overnight but I will get you out.

1675
01:45:18,996 --> 01:45:20,054
Yeah?

1676
01:45:20,230 --> 01:45:22,926
Hey, get the van. We're
moving. Heavy work.

1677
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:25,432
-What about the FBI?
-They're compromised.

1678
01:45:25,602 --> 01:45:27,035
-They're what?
-They're fucked.

1679
01:45:31,074 --> 01:45:32,234
-Yeah.
-Billy, where the fuck are you?

1680
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:34,707
We've been trying to reach
you. We found the rat.

1681
01:45:35,178 --> 01:45:37,169
Listen, we're gonna
take him out. Lookit:

1682
01:45:37,347 --> 01:45:39,941
The address is 314 Washington
Street. You got it?

1683
01:45:40,117 --> 01:45:41,550
Alright, we'll see you there.

1684
01:45:42,085 --> 01:45:43,313
-What?
-You were followed.

1685
01:45:43,487 --> 01:45:45,079
-By who?
-By Costello's people.

1686
01:45:45,255 --> 01:45:46,688
-Impossible.
-One of the cops...

1687
01:45:46,857 --> 01:45:49,587
he's got on the inside tipped
him. Come on. Come on.

1688
01:45:50,561 --> 01:45:52,085
Come on.

1689
01:45:58,735 --> 01:46:01,203
What the fuck is going on?

1690
01:46:02,306 --> 01:46:05,139
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's
meeting with all of them.

1691
01:46:06,043 --> 01:46:08,477
Yeah, he must be our guy.

1692
01:46:08,645 --> 01:46:10,364
Sarge, we gotta get
him out of here.

1693
01:46:10,365 --> 01:46:11,944
Those guys aren't fucking around.

1694
01:46:16,887 --> 01:46:19,720
Ah, Christ, it's too
late. Let's go back up.

1695
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:25,591
-Shit.
-You got to get out of here.

1696
01:46:25,762 --> 01:46:27,593
-Take the fire escape.
-What about you?

1697
01:46:27,764 --> 01:46:30,790
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go. Go!

1698
01:46:48,418 --> 01:46:50,978
-One of you mugs got a light?
-Where's your boy?

1699
01:46:51,154 --> 01:46:54,180
-He's studying law at Notre Dame.
-Where's your fucking boy?

1700
01:46:54,358 --> 01:46:56,451
-Hey. Hey.
-Goddamn motherfucker.

1701
01:46:56,627 --> 01:46:58,652
-Fucking kill you.
-Where's your fucking boy?

1702
01:47:14,978 --> 01:47:17,970
-Whoa!
-What the fuck was that?
-Whoa!
-Did you fucking see that?

1703
01:47:22,319 --> 01:47:24,344
Sarge, something just
came off the building.

1704
01:47:25,155 --> 01:47:27,214
What the fuck?

1705
01:47:30,293 --> 01:47:31,293
Fuck.

1706
01:47:31,461 --> 01:47:33,361
What do you mean, something came
off the building? Go again with that information.

1707
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:35,226
Something came off
the fucking roof.

1708
01:47:35,227 --> 01:47:36,227
It's a fucking body.

1709
01:47:44,941 --> 01:47:46,841
Sarge, we can't get a visual.
Do you want us to get out of the car?

1710
01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:49,774
We gotta get on foot if you want
me to get up on this thing.

1711
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:51,870
-Where the fuck were you?
-What the fuck happened?

1712
01:47:52,049 --> 01:47:53,846
You're fucking late!
Get in the van!

1713
01:47:54,017 --> 01:47:55,382
What do you mean, something came off the roof?

1714
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:57,213
Fuck's what's going on?! I
came to meet you.

1715
01:47:57,387 --> 01:47:58,911
-Where the fuck could you be?
-Get in the van! Get in the van!

1716
01:47:59,089 --> 01:48:02,024
I don't know, Sarge, but I got four armed men right out
front. You want us to pursue?

1717
01:48:02,192 --> 01:48:04,251
No, do not pursue.
Stay in the car.

1718
01:48:04,428 --> 01:48:06,555
-Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
-I need information.

1719
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:08,095
What came off the roof?

1720
01:48:08,265 --> 01:48:09,755
-No pursuit.
-That's bullshit.

1721
01:48:09,933 --> 01:48:11,696
Fuck this.

1722
01:48:19,776 --> 01:48:21,403
Fitzy! Get in the van!

1723
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:25,848
Get in the fucking
van! Let's go! Move!

1724
01:48:26,016 --> 01:48:27,643
Alright. I got him.

1725
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:36,286
32X to CP. We're being fired upon.

1726
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:38,370
An officer is down. I
repeat, an officer

1727
01:48:38,371 --> 01:48:39,861
is down. A trooper's been shot.

1728
01:48:40,030 --> 01:48:42,055
Send some back...

1729
01:48:59,416 --> 01:49:02,579
So do you know why Queenan
went into that building?

1730
01:49:02,753 --> 01:49:04,584
-No.
-Well, a better question...

1731
01:49:04,755 --> 01:49:06,916
is why the fuck were
your guys following him?

1732
01:49:07,090 --> 01:49:09,692
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

1733
01:49:09,693 --> 01:49:10,693
Why?

1734
01:49:10,694 --> 01:49:12,393
That's Internal
Investigations' business.

1735
01:49:13,296 --> 01:49:14,957
Fucking piece of shit!

1736
01:49:15,132 --> 01:49:16,622
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Hey, hey, hey!

1737
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,165
-Fucking bitch.
-Let him go.

1738
01:49:18,335 --> 01:49:20,087
Cocksucker. I don't
have to fucking

1739
01:49:20,088 --> 01:49:21,498
explain anything to anybody!

1740
01:49:21,671 --> 01:49:23,706
I can fucking investigate
anybody I fucking want to!

1741
01:49:23,707 --> 01:49:24,707
Let him go. Come on.

1742
01:49:24,708 --> 01:49:26,237
I don't give a fuck
what you think!

1743
01:49:26,409 --> 01:49:28,087
Captain, I got reason to
believe that Queenan

1744
01:49:28,088 --> 01:49:29,810
got killed by his own
fucking undercover.

1745
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:31,072
That's a fucking lie.

1746
01:49:31,248 --> 01:49:32,848
He has fucking information in a

1747
01:49:32,849 --> 01:49:34,809
locked file, as did
Captain Queenan.

1748
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:36,577
I need access to those files.

1749
01:49:36,753 --> 01:49:39,779
Hey, I forgot the password but if you wanna come down
to the garage with me I'll be happy give it to you.

1750
01:49:39,956 --> 01:49:42,083
-That's a fucking lie.
-Nobody calls me a liar!

1751
01:49:42,259 --> 01:49:45,057
Shut up! Work with the tech
guys to unlock those files.

1752
01:49:45,228 --> 01:49:48,095
-Dignam, take a leave of absence.
-Take a leave of what?

1753
01:49:48,265 --> 01:49:51,200
Queenan is dead.
I'm your boss now.

1754
01:49:51,368 --> 01:49:53,734
I don't give a fuck. I'd rather
hand in my papers first.

1755
01:49:53,904 --> 01:49:57,305
World needs plenty of
bartenders. Two weeks with pay!

1756
01:49:57,474 --> 01:49:58,941
Good.

1757
01:50:00,777 --> 01:50:02,369
-Piece of shit.
-Fuck off.

1758
01:50:04,314 --> 01:50:06,145
-I need those codes.
-No.

1759
01:50:06,316 --> 01:50:08,443
You want those codes.

1760
01:50:11,555 --> 01:50:13,284
So where the fuck were you?

1761
01:50:14,958 --> 01:50:17,518
Well, boss told me to go home.

1762
01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:20,020
Whatever. Maybe he
did, maybe he didn't.

1763
01:50:20,021 --> 01:50:21,892
But you weren't at fucking home.

1764
01:50:22,065 --> 01:50:23,532
So where the fuck were you?

1765
01:50:24,134 --> 01:50:27,035
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, alright?

1766
01:50:27,204 --> 01:50:29,195
When I got the signal,
I got the call.

1767
01:50:29,372 --> 01:50:32,398
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

1768
01:50:32,576 --> 01:50:34,635
Billy. Billy.

1769
01:50:41,017 --> 01:50:42,541
Yeah?

1770
01:50:44,754 --> 01:50:46,745
Yeah?

1771
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:49,385
You know what I thought today?

1772
01:50:51,194 --> 01:50:52,889
What's that?

1773
01:50:53,897 --> 01:50:57,355
Who didn't show up
today is the rat.

1774
01:51:00,837 --> 01:51:02,202
Yeah?

1775
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:04,190
So?

1776
01:51:04,191 --> 01:51:07,040
And you never been
late in your life.

1777
01:51:08,945 --> 01:51:11,175
When I called you...

1778
01:51:11,348 --> 01:51:13,578
I made a mistake.

1779
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:17,550
I gave you the wrong address...

1780
01:51:17,721 --> 01:51:21,555
but you showed up
at the right one...

1781
01:51:22,025 --> 01:51:23,925
didn't you?

1782
01:51:25,195 --> 01:51:27,755
Tell me why I didn't
tell nobody, huh?

1783
01:51:29,032 --> 01:51:30,363
Tell me why.

1784
01:51:53,256 --> 01:51:56,657
That cop was tough. We were
excessive with the cop.

1785
01:51:56,826 --> 01:51:58,623
He's dead.

1786
01:51:58,795 --> 01:52:00,422
I'm going home.

1787
01:52:00,597 --> 01:52:02,329
Your guys should not
have done that.

1788
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:03,395
One of us had to die.

1789
01:52:03,566 --> 01:52:05,591
With me it tends to
be the other guy.

1790
01:52:05,592 --> 01:52:07,236
Yeah. But Queenan. Now I got no access.

1791
01:52:07,404 --> 01:52:09,094
You killed the guy
who had all the the information.

1792
01:52:09,095 --> 01:52:10,573
Now Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

1793
01:52:10,574 --> 01:52:11,574
He resigned.

1794
01:52:11,575 --> 01:52:13,436
I don't give a fuck about Dignam.

1795
01:52:13,610 --> 01:52:15,077
Yeah, he put in his papers, Frank.

1796
01:52:15,245 --> 01:52:17,077
He left. I don't know where he is.

1797
01:52:17,078 --> 01:52:19,306
Don't get your balls
in an uproar, Collie.

1798
01:52:19,482 --> 01:52:20,915
That Irish pissant...

1799
01:52:21,084 --> 01:52:23,012
he's so hot for me,
we give him a whiff

1800
01:52:23,013 --> 01:52:24,747
of my ass, he'll
crawl right in it.

1801
01:52:24,921 --> 01:52:26,980
Let's give him a whiff.

1802
01:52:27,157 --> 01:52:28,157
I will.

1803
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:30,820
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1804
01:52:32,495 --> 01:52:34,156
Sweetheart.

1805
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:36,526
You're giving me a hard-on.

1806
01:52:37,133 --> 01:52:38,532
Are you sure it's me?

1807
01:52:39,035 --> 01:52:42,300
Not all that talk about
whiffing and crawling up asses?

1808
01:52:42,772 --> 01:52:44,763
Watch your fucking mouth.

1809
01:52:44,941 --> 01:52:47,375
No. You watch it.

1810
01:52:48,078 --> 01:52:50,376
Let me straighten you out.

1811
01:52:58,288 --> 01:53:01,155
I tried to call you a few times.

1812
01:53:04,361 --> 01:53:06,124
I know.

1813
01:53:32,522 --> 01:53:36,424
Listen, I...I can't be
a friend to you.

1814
01:53:41,564 --> 01:53:43,464
I'm sorry.

1815
01:53:49,939 --> 01:53:51,668
Yeah...

1816
01:53:56,246 --> 01:53:57,873
I know.

1817
01:56:06,509 --> 01:56:07,999
Yeah.

1818
01:56:08,811 --> 01:56:12,042
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

1819
01:56:12,482 --> 01:56:14,040
Who are you?

1820
01:56:14,284 --> 01:56:16,548
So it is you.

1821
01:56:17,754 --> 01:56:20,746
Well, thank God you're all
right. We were very worried.

1822
01:56:22,158 --> 01:56:23,785
Who are you?

1823
01:56:24,694 --> 01:56:26,719
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

1824
01:56:26,896 --> 01:56:28,659
I'm taking over Queenan's unit.

1825
01:56:29,365 --> 01:56:31,390
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

1826
01:56:31,568 --> 01:56:32,899
Staff Sergeant Dignam...

1827
01:56:33,069 --> 01:56:36,266
is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

1828
01:56:36,439 --> 01:56:38,634
We're all very upset.

1829
01:56:39,275 --> 01:56:42,039
I think the best thing would
be for you to come in.

1830
01:56:43,012 --> 01:56:45,913
We need you to come
in. Can you come in?

1831
01:56:47,383 --> 01:56:48,383
We'll meet...

1832
01:57:27,557 --> 01:57:29,855
Police confirm the body
of the man found dead...

1833
01:57:30,026 --> 01:57:31,994
in the Fenway marshes yesterday afternoon...

1834
01:57:32,161 --> 01:57:35,153
is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...

1835
01:57:35,331 --> 01:57:37,822
the city of Boston. This
was the scene yesterday...

1836
01:57:38,001 --> 01:57:40,970
when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.

1837
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:42,695
As for who did this or why...

1838
01:57:42,872 --> 01:57:45,272
that's something police
are working on right now.

1839
01:57:45,441 --> 01:57:48,899
-I don't believe it.
-What can't you believe?

1840
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:52,603
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

1841
01:57:52,782 --> 01:57:54,716
Tell me how they
found him so fast.

1842
01:57:54,884 --> 01:57:57,512
Somebody walking a fucking
dog in three feet of mud?

1843
01:57:57,687 --> 01:57:59,848
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

1844
01:58:00,023 --> 01:58:02,150
Must have been a big
fucking dog, man.

1845
01:58:02,325 --> 01:58:04,555
I spent all fucking
night doing it, man.

1846
01:58:04,927 --> 01:58:06,224
I'm embarrassed.

1847
01:58:06,896 --> 01:58:09,558
I still don't believe he was
a cop. I don't believe it.

1848
01:58:09,732 --> 01:58:14,260
The cops are saying he's a cop...

1849
01:58:14,637 --> 01:58:16,832
so I won't look for the cop.

1850
01:58:18,107 --> 01:58:19,734
Are you soft, Fitz?

1851
01:58:19,909 --> 01:58:24,869
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

1852
01:58:25,048 --> 01:58:27,983
you dump him in the marsh!

1853
01:58:29,018 --> 01:58:32,317
Not where some guy from John
Hancock goes every Thursday...

1854
01:58:32,488 --> 01:58:34,581
to get a fucking blowjob!

1855
01:58:35,358 --> 01:58:37,519
Don't laugh!

1856
01:58:38,361 --> 01:58:41,262
This ain't reality TV!

1857
01:58:45,201 --> 01:58:46,964
Proceed.

1858
01:59:09,425 --> 01:59:10,892
-What?
-Yeah.

1859
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:13,824
You got a tail. Two
cars. Not very subtle.

1860
01:59:13,996 --> 01:59:15,868
They're not gonna be
subtle from now on.

1861
01:59:15,869 --> 01:59:17,557
That's what I've
been trying to say.

1862
01:59:17,734 --> 01:59:18,860
So get rid of them.

1863
01:59:19,035 --> 01:59:22,129
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

1864
01:59:22,305 --> 01:59:24,535
Get rid of the fucking tail!

1865
01:59:29,479 --> 01:59:31,037
Alright.

1866
01:59:37,353 --> 01:59:40,550
Fucking rats. It's
wearing me thin.

1867
01:59:40,723 --> 01:59:43,521
Francis, it's a nation
of fucking rats.

1868
01:59:59,842 --> 02:00:01,607
Stop, stop. Pull
them off Costello.

1869
02:00:01,608 --> 02:00:03,175
There's no need to surveil him.

1870
02:00:03,346 --> 02:00:05,712
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-I got it from an undercover.

1871
02:00:05,882 --> 02:00:08,544
He knows he's being followed.
So let's just let the UC take him in.

1872
02:00:08,751 --> 02:00:10,116
-What undercover?
-Queenan's guy.

1873
02:00:10,286 --> 02:00:12,948
He called me when he found out
Queenan was dead. I'm running him.

1874
02:00:13,122 --> 02:00:14,122
You're running him? You give him to me.

1875
02:00:14,123 --> 02:00:16,057
No, no. I can give you
Costello's destination.

1876
02:00:16,259 --> 02:00:18,727
-You know where he's going?
-Yes. And what he's doing.

1877
02:00:18,895 --> 02:00:21,056
So get rid of the tail, get
Special Ops on standby.

1878
02:00:21,230 --> 02:00:23,664
-We'll take this prick tonight.
-Alright, let's go. Now.

1879
02:00:23,833 --> 02:00:26,825
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

1880
02:00:47,190 --> 02:00:49,249
Alright, it's the warehouse he
owns over on Sheffield.

1881
02:00:49,425 --> 02:00:52,019
He's gotta have a container or a
truck or something there. Go, go, go, go.

1882
02:01:16,319 --> 02:01:17,843
Load it.

1883
02:01:25,862 --> 02:01:28,160
Frank, how do you know you
don't have a tail, huh?

1884
02:01:29,432 --> 02:01:31,400
Were you not in the fucking car?

1885
02:01:31,567 --> 02:01:34,627
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

1886
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,637
Load.

1887
02:01:47,216 --> 02:01:49,047
Go, go.

1888
02:01:51,487 --> 02:01:53,045
Come on, what are you waiting for?!

1889
02:01:55,124 --> 02:01:57,251
Frank wants me to check
the back, alright? You go ahead.

1890
02:01:57,426 --> 02:02:00,884
-Watch your fucking back.
-Move out. Go on.

1891
02:02:09,906 --> 02:02:12,340
Cocksuckers.

1892
02:02:18,347 --> 02:02:20,907
Motherfucking shit.

1893
02:02:24,353 --> 02:02:26,014
Motherfucking.

1894
02:02:29,425 --> 02:02:31,689
Back the fuck up.

1895
02:02:31,861 --> 02:02:33,954
They fucking shot me.

1896
02:02:37,667 --> 02:02:38,793
Get down.

1897
02:02:41,804 --> 02:02:43,362
Come on, fucking bastards.

1898
02:03:02,091 --> 02:03:03,558
Fuck it.

1899
02:03:42,999 --> 02:03:46,765
How the fuck did this happen?

1900
02:03:48,170 --> 02:03:50,764
You're an FBI informant?

1901
02:03:50,940 --> 02:03:53,135
Are you fucking kidding me?

1902
02:03:54,610 --> 02:03:56,305
Grow up.

1903
02:03:57,013 --> 02:03:59,948
Of course I talk to the FBI.

1904
02:04:00,116 --> 02:04:01,606
Do they know who I am?

1905
02:04:03,552 --> 02:04:07,921
I never gave up anybody who
wasn't going down anyway.

1906
02:04:08,958 --> 02:04:11,392
Nobody knows nothing.

1907
02:04:12,995 --> 02:04:14,485
Frank.

1908
02:04:14,797 --> 02:04:17,698
Frank. Frank.

1909
02:04:17,867 --> 02:04:19,858
Do they know about me?

1910
02:04:21,570 --> 02:04:24,095
I know about you, Collie.

1911
02:04:24,273 --> 02:04:27,106
You know I'd never give you up.

1912
02:04:27,843 --> 02:04:30,607
-You're like a...
-What? Like a son?

1913
02:04:31,514 --> 02:04:34,881
To you? Is that
what this is about?

1914
02:04:35,851 --> 02:04:40,185
All that murdering and
fucking, and no sons.

1915
02:05:02,211 --> 02:05:04,645
Fucking rat prick.

1916
02:05:26,235 --> 02:05:27,827
Frank?

1917
02:05:28,003 --> 02:05:29,493
Yeah?

1918
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:32,468
Who's this?

1919
02:05:34,376 --> 02:05:36,003
Gwen?

1920
02:05:37,146 --> 02:05:39,239
Where the hell's Frank?

1921
02:05:40,316 --> 02:05:42,113
Frank got shot.

1922
02:05:44,954 --> 02:05:47,354
Gwen, we lost Frank.

1923
02:05:55,731 --> 02:05:57,358
I got him!

1924
02:05:57,533 --> 02:05:59,967
I got Costello here!

1925
02:06:04,106 --> 02:06:06,597
Hey, good job, Sarge.

1926
02:06:07,376 --> 02:06:08,934
No, it's...

1927
02:06:10,346 --> 02:06:11,938
For you.

1928
02:06:13,015 --> 02:06:16,075
-Thank you.
-No. Thank you.

1929
02:06:19,588 --> 02:06:22,819
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

1930
02:06:23,025 --> 02:06:25,459
How'd you get him
without the files?

1931
02:06:25,628 --> 02:06:28,726
-Caller ID on Queenan's phone.
-Hmm.

1932
02:06:29,398 --> 02:06:30,763
You know that guy?

1933
02:06:30,933 --> 02:06:33,800
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

1934
02:06:41,243 --> 02:06:42,777
Good to see you, trooper.

1935
02:06:42,778 --> 02:06:43,778
Yeah.

1936
02:06:43,779 --> 02:06:45,740
Colin Sullivan. We
spoke on the phone.

1937
02:06:45,915 --> 02:06:47,473
-Yeah.
-So.

1938
02:06:49,018 --> 02:06:50,781
Now, how long were you undercover?

1939
02:06:50,953 --> 02:06:52,853
Long time.

1940
02:06:53,022 --> 02:06:54,853
-Long fucking time.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1941
02:06:55,257 --> 02:07:00,194
Well, I can't even
tell you the debt...

1942
02:07:03,032 --> 02:07:04,447
I just want you to know I'll be

1943
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:06,365
recommending you for
the Medal of Merit.

1944
02:07:06,535 --> 02:07:08,230
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1945
02:07:09,171 --> 02:07:11,537
That's kind of like a gold
star around here, huh?

1946
02:07:13,576 --> 02:07:15,373
It's the highest honour we got.

1947
02:07:15,544 --> 02:07:18,342
Look, I just want my
identity back, alright?

1948
02:07:18,514 --> 02:07:20,505
-That's all.
-Alright.

1949
02:07:20,683 --> 02:07:22,859
I understand. You
wanna be a cop again.

1950
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:23,860
No, no.

1951
02:07:23,861 --> 02:07:27,347
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

1952
02:07:27,623 --> 02:07:30,592
Check your computer. Go on. You'll
have to excuse my behaviour.

1953
02:07:30,759 --> 02:07:34,718
My only contact in the last six
months has been a police shrink.

1954
02:07:37,366 --> 02:07:39,664
How's that working for you?

1955
02:07:39,835 --> 02:07:41,564
Is it helpful?

1956
02:07:42,304 --> 02:07:45,068
What are you gonna do about
Costello's rat in this building?

1957
02:07:47,676 --> 02:07:50,907
-I'm gonna find the prick.
-Yeah.

1958
02:07:51,347 --> 02:07:54,043
I'm gonna find him,
I'm gonna arrest him.

1959
02:07:54,216 --> 02:07:55,216
Good.

1960
02:07:55,217 --> 02:07:57,379
If there's anything you can do to help me...

1961
02:07:57,553 --> 02:07:59,331
You know, I mean, did Frank ever

1962
02:07:59,332 --> 02:08:01,387
mention a name? You
know, anything.

1963
02:08:01,557 --> 02:08:04,151
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

1964
02:08:04,326 --> 02:08:06,886
I'm all done being
a cop, alright?

1965
02:08:07,062 --> 02:08:09,223
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

1966
02:08:09,398 --> 02:08:11,798
Alright. That'll be the
best thing I think for everybody.

1967
02:08:11,967 --> 02:08:13,366
Fair enough.

1968
02:08:13,969 --> 02:08:18,429
I just, I can't, can't get into your
file unless I have your password.

1969
02:08:20,609 --> 02:08:21,633
It's my name.

1970
02:08:22,444 --> 02:08:24,810
William Costigan Jr.

1971
02:08:24,980 --> 02:08:26,613
They gave it to me
in case I had to

1972
02:08:26,614 --> 02:08:28,245
explain myself to
someone like you.

1973
02:08:28,817 --> 02:08:30,751
It's your name.

1974
02:08:32,855 --> 02:08:34,254
Alright.

1975
02:08:34,423 --> 02:08:37,119
Uh...fucking unreal, that's...
Well, makes a lot of sense.

1976
02:08:37,293 --> 02:08:39,523
Listen, Bill, I gotta run
this in the other room.

1977
02:08:39,695 --> 02:08:41,959
This computer's getting all
frigging blooey on me.

1978
02:08:42,131 --> 02:08:45,897
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

1979
02:10:19,228 --> 02:10:23,062
Alright, everything checks
out, so let's get you paid.

1980
02:10:54,029 --> 02:10:55,792
I know.

1981
02:10:57,332 --> 02:10:59,823
I know. I'm not... I'm
not here for that, okay?

1982
02:11:00,102 --> 02:11:01,694
I'm not.

1983
02:11:03,906 --> 02:11:07,171
Listen. I've gotta
give you something.

1984
02:11:07,342 --> 02:11:09,776
Something I need you to keep.

1985
02:11:09,945 --> 02:11:11,537
For me.

1986
02:11:13,816 --> 02:11:15,408
Okay?

1987
02:11:19,021 --> 02:11:20,117
What is it?

1988
02:11:20,118 --> 02:11:23,321
This is for you to hold. Only you.

1989
02:11:23,492 --> 02:11:25,541
You open this if something
happens to me or

1990
02:11:25,542 --> 02:11:27,451
if I call you and I
tell you to open it.

1991
02:11:27,629 --> 02:11:30,189
You're the only person I
can trust, alright?

1992
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:33,392
Please.

1993
02:11:36,939 --> 02:11:39,339
-Alright.
-Look, I'm sorry to even...

1994
02:11:39,508 --> 02:11:42,204
I'm sorry to even show up
here like this, you know?

1995
02:11:42,377 --> 02:11:45,642
I... There's just no one
else I could give it to.

1996
02:11:47,082 --> 02:11:49,243
There's no one else.

1997
02:11:50,018 --> 02:11:52,748
-I'm really sorry.
-I...um.

1998
02:11:53,355 --> 02:11:55,323
You know, I have...um.

1999
02:11:55,491 --> 02:11:57,925
-I...
-Whatever you have to say...

2000
02:11:58,093 --> 02:12:00,288
think about it real
hard, alright?

2001
02:12:00,462 --> 02:12:03,989
If you still wanna tell me, you
tell me in two weeks, okay?

2002
02:12:33,762 --> 02:12:35,696
I was dreaming I was dead.

2003
02:12:37,065 --> 02:12:41,263
Death is hard. Life
is much easier.

2004
02:12:42,204 --> 02:12:45,435
-What's this?
-Open it.

2005
02:12:54,283 --> 02:12:56,945
-Really?
-Yeah.

2006
02:12:57,986 --> 02:12:59,453
Really?

2007
02:13:00,122 --> 02:13:01,646
Yeah.

2008
02:13:01,823 --> 02:13:05,384
And they, they say that
this little speck...

2009
02:13:05,561 --> 02:13:07,756
is a penis.

2010
02:13:10,033 --> 02:13:12,898
Wow. It's a boy.

2011
02:13:13,068 --> 02:13:15,866
Yeah, well, one usually
follows the other.

2012
02:13:17,372 --> 02:13:19,363
Can you still uh...

2013
02:14:09,925 --> 02:14:11,916
I hope I won't have
to remind you...

2014
02:14:12,094 --> 02:14:14,414
that if you don't find
this cheese-eating

2015
02:14:14,415 --> 02:14:16,292
rat bastard in your department...

2016
02:14:16,465 --> 02:14:20,128
you can assume it won't
be me who pays for it.

2017
02:14:20,302 --> 02:14:23,135
Now, why would you have
to remind me of that?

2018
02:14:23,305 --> 02:14:26,054
Would I? Would I be
any good at what I do

2019
02:14:26,055 --> 02:14:28,607
if I didn't fucking
already know that?

2020
02:14:28,777 --> 02:14:31,974
Frank, you gotta trust
me. I can get the rat.

2021
02:14:32,147 --> 02:14:34,513
You just gotta let me
do it my way, Frank.

2022
02:14:34,683 --> 02:14:38,084
Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.

2023
02:14:38,253 --> 02:14:40,264
Hey, it fucking
involves lying and I'm

2024
02:14:40,265 --> 02:14:42,121
pretty fucking good
at that. Right?

2025
02:14:45,794 --> 02:14:47,352
What?

2026
02:14:50,966 --> 02:14:52,456
What?

2027
02:14:54,770 --> 02:14:57,068
-We got a cop in my crew.
-Yeah, I know.

2028
02:14:57,239 --> 02:14:59,534
I'm kind of getting
that feeling too.

2029
02:14:59,535 --> 02:15:01,198
He's one of yours. Inside.

2030
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:02,707
-You seen anything?
-Frank.

2031
02:15:02,878 --> 02:15:04,698
I got no access to
Queenan's undercover

2032
02:15:04,699 --> 02:15:06,473
files. He and Dignam
run the snitches.

2033
02:15:06,648 --> 02:15:07,919
I'm doing my...

2034
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:11,210
You know what, I thought
I was the liar.

2035
02:15:11,386 --> 02:15:14,321
Hey, I can explain that.

2036
02:15:19,494 --> 02:15:21,519
Costello recorded everything.

2037
02:15:21,697 --> 02:15:24,059
He put all the tapes
in a little box and kept them

2038
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:26,259
with his lawyer. That
was his insurance.

2039
02:15:26,435 --> 02:15:27,925
His lawyer came to me.

2040
02:15:28,103 --> 02:15:29,866
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

2041
02:15:30,038 --> 02:15:32,029
Costello trusted me
more than anyone.

2042
02:15:32,708 --> 02:15:35,905
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

2043
02:15:36,311 --> 02:15:37,311
What do you want?

2044
02:15:37,312 --> 02:15:39,005
I told you I want
my identity back...

2045
02:15:39,181 --> 02:15:41,206
you two-faced faggot.

2046
02:15:41,516 --> 02:15:43,109
Alright, where are you?

2047
02:15:43,110 --> 02:15:45,350
Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

2048
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:47,454
You keep your cell on.

2049
02:15:59,568 --> 02:16:01,331
Open the door.

2050
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:09,333
Open... Didn't we already
talk about this?

2051
02:16:10,512 --> 02:16:12,673
This is my job.

2052
02:16:37,939 --> 02:16:39,432
Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!

2053
02:16:39,433 --> 02:16:40,433
Hey! Hey! Hey!

2054
02:16:40,434 --> 02:16:41,632
Put the fucking gun down!

2055
02:16:41,810 --> 02:16:43,472
Put the gun, put the gun down,
alright? I came

2056
02:16:43,473 --> 02:16:45,041
here to talk some sense into you.

2057
02:16:45,213 --> 02:16:46,771
-Hands!
-Alright, just act professional.

2058
02:16:46,948 --> 02:16:48,973
-I can get you your money.
-What did you say?

2059
02:16:49,151 --> 02:16:50,518
I can get you your money.

2060
02:16:50,519 --> 02:16:52,746
You didn't come here
to talk, alright?

2061
02:16:52,921 --> 02:16:55,890
-You came here to get arrested.
-You got fucking tapes? Of what?

2062
02:16:56,057 --> 02:16:59,549
Costello was my informant. I
was a rat? Fuck you. Prove it.

2063
02:16:59,728 --> 02:17:01,719
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

2064
02:17:01,897 --> 02:17:03,762
Shut your fucking
mouth. Come on, get up.

2065
02:17:03,932 --> 02:17:06,332
What is this, a citizen's
arrest? Blow me, alright?

2066
02:17:06,501 --> 02:17:09,334
Only one of us is a cop here,
Bill. You understand that, Bill?

2067
02:17:09,504 --> 02:17:11,404
-No one knows who you fucking are!
-Will you shut the fuck up?!

2068
02:17:11,573 --> 02:17:13,206
I'm a sergeant in
the Massachusetts

2069
02:17:13,207 --> 02:17:14,838
State Police. Who
the fuck are you?

2070
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:18,138
-I erased you.
-You erased me, huh?

2071
02:17:18,313 --> 02:17:20,975
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop,
Einstein. Watch what happens.

2072
02:17:21,149 --> 02:17:23,617
What would happen is this bullet
would go right through your fucking head!

2073
02:17:23,785 --> 02:17:24,785
Watch what happens!

2074
02:17:24,786 --> 02:17:26,481
What, so you can get
the parade, huh?

2075
02:17:26,655 --> 02:17:28,885
The bagpipes and
bullshit? Fuck you!

2076
02:17:28,886 --> 02:17:31,115
Fuck you, I'm fucking
arresting you!

2077
02:17:31,293 --> 02:17:33,180
That's the stupidest
thing you could do.

2078
02:17:33,181 --> 02:17:34,181
Shut the fuck up.

2079
02:17:36,798 --> 02:17:39,028
I could give a fuck if
the charges don't stick.

2080
02:17:39,201 --> 02:17:40,896
I'm still fucking arresting you.

2081
02:17:41,336 --> 02:17:43,236
Get up.

2082
02:17:44,406 --> 02:17:47,432
Drop your weapon and step
away from Sergeant Sullivan.

2083
02:17:47,609 --> 02:17:50,134
I called you. You
specifically. Look,

2084
02:17:50,312 --> 02:17:52,132
You know who I am.
I'm not gonna shoot.

2085
02:17:52,133 --> 02:17:53,679
-I told you to meet me downstairs.
-Help me, help, help, help!

2086
02:17:53,849 --> 02:17:56,818
Put your weapon on the deck and
step away from Sergeant Sullivan.

2087
02:17:56,985 --> 02:17:59,112
Where's Dignam? I told
you to bring Dignam.

2088
02:17:59,287 --> 02:18:01,517
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot?

2089
02:18:01,690 --> 02:18:03,491
Drop your weapon to the floor
and we'll discuss it.

2090
02:18:03,492 --> 02:18:05,387
Look, he's Costello's
rat, alright?

2091
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:10,224
I got boxes of tapes. Evidence.
Other documents proving it.

2092
02:18:12,634 --> 02:18:14,568
Maybe you do.

2093
02:18:14,736 --> 02:18:16,863
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon.

2094
02:18:17,038 --> 02:18:20,007
I told you, I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, alright?

2095
02:18:20,175 --> 02:18:22,087
Would you shoot
this fucking prick?

2096
02:18:22,088 --> 02:18:23,144
You know who I am.

2097
02:18:23,311 --> 02:18:25,404
-You know who I am.
-Shoot this fucking prick.

2098
02:18:25,580 --> 02:18:27,775
I'm taking him downstairs now.

2099
02:18:31,086 --> 02:18:32,917
You know who I am.

2100
02:18:58,046 --> 02:18:59,911
Shut up.

2101
02:19:00,949 --> 02:19:03,975
I can't wait to see you explain
this to a fucking Suffolk County jury...

2102
02:19:04,152 --> 02:19:05,346
you fucking cocksucker.

2103
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:08,045
This is gonna be fucking fun.

2104
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:21,498
Just fucking kill me.

2105
02:19:23,104 --> 02:19:25,265
Just fucking kill me.

2106
02:19:27,542 --> 02:19:29,601
I am killing you.

2107
02:20:05,814 --> 02:20:08,544
Did you think you were the
only one he had on the inside?

2108
02:20:08,783 --> 02:20:11,081
Costello was gonna
sell us to the FBI.

2109
02:20:11,252 --> 02:20:12,947
It's you and me now,
you understand?

2110
02:20:13,121 --> 02:20:15,988
We gotta take care of each
other, you understand?

2111
02:20:29,604 --> 02:20:31,196
Give me that.

2112
02:20:46,621 --> 02:20:49,988
Right. Slow. March.

2113
02:20:58,199 --> 02:21:00,394
I attempted to subdue
Trooper Barrigan...

2114
02:21:00,568 --> 02:21:02,832
at which time he
drew down on me, and

2115
02:21:02,833 --> 02:21:05,096
I was able to squeeze
off one shot...

2116
02:21:05,273 --> 02:21:07,434
and strike him in the head.

2117
02:21:07,609 --> 02:21:10,043
At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...

2118
02:21:10,211 --> 02:21:12,406
on both Troopers Brown
and Costigan...

2119
02:21:12,580 --> 02:21:15,743
and discovered that
they had expired.

2120
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:21,184
I just wanna go on record.

2121
02:21:21,923 --> 02:21:25,882
I'm recommending William
Costigan for the Medal of Merit.

2122
02:21:36,871 --> 02:21:38,620
Eternal rest grant
unto him, O Lord.

2123
02:21:38,621 --> 02:21:39,621
Ready?

2124
02:21:39,622 --> 02:21:41,550
And let perpetual
light shine upon him.

2125
02:21:41,551 --> 02:21:42,551
Fold.

2126
02:21:42,552 --> 02:21:45,242
May he rest in peace. Amen.

2127
02:21:45,413 --> 02:21:47,745
May his soul and the souls...

2128
02:21:47,916 --> 02:21:50,504
of all the faithful
departed, through

2129
02:21:50,505 --> 02:21:52,751
the mercy of God, rest in peace.

2130
02:21:52,921 --> 02:21:54,513
Amen.

2131
02:22:23,952 --> 02:22:26,182
Detail. Half left. Face.

2132
02:22:27,555 --> 02:22:29,546
Prepare to fire.

2133
02:22:29,791 --> 02:22:31,418
Fire.

2134
02:22:31,593 --> 02:22:34,084
Prepare to fire. Fire.

2135
02:22:34,996 --> 02:22:38,022
Prepare to fire. Fire.

2136
02:22:38,466 --> 02:22:41,765
Detail. Half right. Face.

2137
02:22:55,183 --> 02:22:57,549
I'll catch up with you guys.

2138
02:23:04,826 --> 02:23:06,657
What about the baby?

2139
02:23:24,379 --> 02:23:26,006
Hi, pup.

2140
02:23:57,545 --> 02:23:59,172
Okay.
