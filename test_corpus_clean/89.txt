somebody fucked us up big time man you really think we were set up do you even doubt it man i dont think we got set up i know it where did all those cops come from huh one minute theyre not there and the next minute theyre there i didnt hear any sirens the alarm went off okay when an alarm goes you got a fourminute response time unless a patrol car is cruising that street at that moment you got four minutes before they can realistically respond in one minute there were 17 blue boys out there all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing and they were all there remember that second wave that showed up in the cars those were the ones responding to the alarm but those first motherfuckers they were there and they were waitin for us havent you fuckin thought about this i havent had a chance to think first i was just tryin to get the fuck outta there and after we got away ive just been dealin with him better start thinkin about it cause thats all im thinkin about i wasnt even gonna come here i was just gonna drive off man because whoever set us up knows about this place there couldve been cops here waitin there could be cops comin right now lets go in the other room hey in there larry dont leave me ill be right in the other room okay ill be right there lookin at ya im right here lookin at you okay im right over there larry im gonna fucking die larry what the fuck am i doin here man i felt funny about this job right off as soon as i felt it i should have said no thank you but i never listen every time i ever got fucked buying weed the same thing i didnt trust the guy but i wanted to believe him if hes not lying and it really is thai stick then its great but it never is and i always said that if i felt that about a job id walk and i didnt i didnt because of the fuckin money whats done is done i need you cool are you cool im cool splash some water on your face take a breather relax have a cigarette i quit all right why you got one okay lets go through what happened were in the place everythings going fine then the alarm gets tripped i turn around and all these cops are outside youre right it was like bam i blinked my eyes and theyre there everybody starts going apeshit then mr blonde starts to shoot all thats not correct whats wrong with it okay the cops did not show up after the alarm went off the cops didnt show up until after mr blonde started shootin everybody soon as i heard the alarm i saw cops it wasnt that soon they didnt let their presence be known until after mr blonde became a madman im not sayin they werent there im sayin they were there but they didnt make a move until after mr blonde started shootin everybody i mean thats how i know we were set up mr white you can see that enough of this mr white shit wait dont tell me youre fuckin name i dont wanna know it jesus christ i aint gonna tell you mine youre right this is bad how did you get out i shot my way out everybody started shootin so i blasted my way out of there move it get outta the way get the fuck outta the way get the fuck outta the way move it get outta the way jesus christ what the fuck is your problem man you fuckin asshole fuck you move jesus get outta the car get the fuck outta the car move it move outta the way i tagged a couple of cops did you kill anybody a few cops no real people just cops could you believe mr blonde that was the most insane fuckin thing i have ever seen why the fuck would joe hire a guy like that i dont want to kill anybody if i gotta get out that door and youre standin in my way one way or the other youre gettin outta my way thats the way i look at it the choice between doin ten years and takin out some stupid motherfucker aint no choice at all but i aint no madman either what the fuck was joe thinkin you cant work with a guy like that were awful goddamn lucky he didnt tag us when he shot the place up i came this close to takin his ass out myself i mean everybody panics everybody things get tense its human nature you panic i dont care what your name is you cant help it fuck man you panic on the inside in your head you know you give yourself a couple of seconds get ahold of it and deal with it what you dont do is start shootin up the place and start killin people what youre supposed to do is act like a fuckin professional a psychopath aint a professional you cant work with a psychopath you dont know what those sick assholes are gonna do next i mean jesus christ how old do you think that black girl was twenty maybe 21 if that did you see what happened to anybody else me and orange jumped in the car brown floored it after that i dont know what went down it was every man for himself as far as mr blonde and mr blue are concerned i aint got the foggiest cause once i got out i never looked back what do you think what do i think the cops either caught em or killed em no chance they punched through you found a hole yeah and that was a fuckin miracle but even if they did get away then where the fuck are they you dont think its possible one of em got ahold of the diamonds and no no way how can you be so sure i got the diamonds thats my boy where i stashed em if you wanna come with me lets go get em right now this second cause i think stayin here man we should have our fuckin heads examined that was the plan we meet here then where the fuck is everybody i say the plan becomes null and void once we found out we got a rat here we aint got the slightest idea what happened to mr blonde or mr blue they could both be dead or maybe theyre arrested the cops could have em right now at the station sweatin em down they dont know our names but they could be singin about this place i swear to god i think im fuckin jinxed what two jobs back it was a fourman job we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop no shit thank god we discovered in time we had to forget the whole thing just walk the fuck away from it so whos the rat this time mr blue mr brown joe joe set this whole thing up maybe he set it up to set it up i dont buy it me and joe go back a long time i can tell you definitely joe didnt know a thing about this bullshit i know joe and me sayin he definitely had nothin to do with

what undercover cops gotta be brando to do this job you gotta be a great actor naturalistic you gotta be naturalistic as hell if youre a bad actor thats bullshit in this job what is this thats an amusing anecdote about a drug deal something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job i gotta memorize all this theres four pages of this shit think about it like its a joke memorize whats important the rest you make your own you can tell a joke cant you well pretend youre don rickles and tell a joke all right the things you gotta remember are the details the details sell your story this particular story takes place in a mens room you gotta know all the details whether they got paper towels or a blower to dry your hands you gotta know if the stalls aint got no doors or not you gotta know if they got liquid soap or that pink granulated shit they used in high school you gotta know if they got hot water or not if it stinks if some nasty lowlife scumridden motherfucker sprayed diarrhea all over one of the bowls you gotta know every detail there is to know about this commode what you gotta do is take all them details and make em your own while youre doing that remember that this story is about you and how you perceived the events that went down the only way to do that is keep sayin it and sayin it and sayin it this is during the la marijuana drought 1986 i still had a connection which was insane cause you couldnt get any weed anywhere then anyway i had a connection with this hippie chick in santa cruz and all my friends knew it they call me and say hey freddy i say hey dude you gettin some can you get some for me too they knew i still smoked so they asked me to buy some for them it got to be every time i bought some weed i was buyin for four or five

even rent a tape without six fuckin interruptions whens the next time youre gettin some motherfucker im tryin to watch the lost boys when i get some ill call you then these rinkadink potheads come by theyre my friends and everything but still i got it laid out in 60dollar bags they dont want 60 dollars worth they want ten dollars worth and breaking it up wasnt easy i dont even know what ten

county unexpectedly what for his traffic tickets gone to warrant they stopped him found warrants on him took him to county she doesnt wanna walk around alone with all that weed i dont wanna do this i have a very bad feeling about it she keeps asking me asking me finally i said okay cause im sick of hearing it so we go to the train station wait youre goin to the train station with the weed on ya
