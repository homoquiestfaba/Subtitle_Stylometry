because ill do it heres to the best damn salvage crew in the business we did it guys yeah look at that all right nice work heres to the fucking sea to the sea to a job well done mr murphy im jack ferriman i was wondering if i could buy you a drink he doesnt drink could i talk to you alone you talk to me you talk to my crew thats the way it is i fly the arctic weather patrol flights out of mackenzie bay last month i was out in the middle of the strait when i came across this congratulations you found a boat in the middle of the ocean of all places i tried for radio contact and got nothing so i figured she had to be adrift in the bering strait thats miles from shipping lanes did you alert the coast guard its international waters so they noted it and thats it you get a name no i put it out of my head until two days ago when i saw it again what are we talking about what kind of tonnage big huge could be military lets say that were a little bit interested whats in it for you i want 20 finders fee whatever shes worth have you told anyone else about this not a living soul give us a minute will you okay so what do you think murph who knows could be full of shit i do know one thing ive seen strange things happen in the strait i know something else sea gives you an opportunity take it thats at least a week out of our way weve been out for six months already i got a fiancée waiting remember im getting married in a month plan was to go back to anchorage starboard diesel needs an overhaul in our business the only plan is there is no plan if you dont want to go thats fine lets tell him well get somebody else wait a minute lets not be hasty whats a ship like that worth who knows millions thousands could be nothing depends on a lot of things mainly if we have the right to salvage pretty big if whats the split we split it even six ways even split beats me paying you overtime im good im in greer what do you say all right hey ferriman can you come over here so this is the way it works 10 instead of your 20 finders fee i cant let you take advantage of me like that thats the way it is take it or leave it fine but i go with you not on my boat you dont think id tell you where a fortune might be without insurance there are five other boats that would jump at this i come with you so you take it or leave it things are dull shell love it what do you think too much

throttle till she was bonedry epps im looking for the ships log lets get this documentation back are you okay yeah you sure yeah lets get to it hey check this out its a watch congratulations buddy no look again you moron its a digital watch do the math they didnt have digital watches in 1962 so were not the first people to board this ship but shes ours now lets get some sleep tow her at dawn lets hope theres no more surprises amen to that oh god epps can i get some tea any sign of what mightve happened how she got here thats the 64 million question isnt it ever hear of a ship called the marie celeste twinmasted brigantine out of charleston during the civil war she was bound for london with a cargo of cotton thanks two months after she set sail she was sighted by fishermen off tripoli she was doing 12 knots an hour in a stiff breeze something wasnt quite right they didnt know what so they went onboard you know what they found nothing no passengers no crew no captain no sign of distress 59 days after the last log entry it had traveled 4500 miles across the ocean past the rock of gibraltar and into the mediterranean sea at full sail and nobody at the helm what do you make of that a ghost ship hey you smell that i smell bullshit been on the sea a lot longer than you i know seen things that you cant even imagine maritime history is full of marie celestes so whats our plan i think we should do what we came to do tie her up tug her in you think our little tug will pull this entire ocean liner not with the problems we got we could set her at anchor and come back with two or three tugs no some russian trawler will come along ive already looked for her anchors anyway theyre gone what do you think get the engines working it could take us two weeks minimum to tow a vessel this size for my share of what shes worth id drag her back to anchorage myself dont let go help me dont let go thought you might want a jacket thanks boy do i miss that you okay you seem quiet since you came back i think i saw something i couldnt possibly have seen like what no its crazy im curious tell me i think i saw a little girl on on the the boat yeah looking right at me and then what happened nothing she disappeared sometimes when id be flying for hours on end id think id see stuff too itd be there one second and gone the next like a dream thanks see you in the am okay good night see you tomorrow yeah shes got a big hole shes sinking this is where the damage is see breach in the hull about 10 by 20 torn to the port collision bulkhead did it hit an iceberg no you dont need an iceberg to rupture a hull shes been hit recently about a week ago id say this is where we are the problems this group of islands nothing spectacular just rocks a couple thousand seals the antonia grazas caught here in this strong current loop and slowly shes been pushed towards those rocks last time she hit them what about next time wont be one weve got three days to fix it thats if the weather holds why cant we tow it like it is itd be like towing a car with four flat tires its a bump in the road we can fix it murph bump in the road the breach we can probably patch if we can get to the inside well weld shut the flooded compartments pump out the water up to the aft peak on top of that the rudders jammed we jerryrig it set a 38degree current drift to clear the island chain what does all that mean i just thats a lot of work for three days but with the gear weve got onboard and whats on that ship we can try we can do it right with the gear weve got onboard i cant fix our engine quit bitching and overhaul the starboard engine so thats the plan just do it ill call it in i wouldnt do that if i were you maritime law states i know we just dont want any unexpected guests just leave it your call captain all right you know the drill we do a complete recon make sure weve got no problems before we get to work stay with me greer dont wander okay dodge munder go to the port collision bulkhead jack and ill work back from the fore call if you need anything how about a pizza youre so funny the only plan in this business is that there is no plan what is that what these people talking
