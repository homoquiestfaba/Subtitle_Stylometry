 if i dont draw for a while i get really crazy i start feeling depressed and suicidal if i dont get to draw but sometimes when im drawing i feel suicidal too what are you trying to get at in your work jesus i dont know i dont work in terms of conscious messages i cant do that it has to be something im revealing to myself while im doing it which is hard to explain which means that while im doing it i dont know exactly what its about you have to have the courage to take that chance whats gonna come out whats coming out of this i enjoy drawing its a deeply ingrained habit its all because of my brother charles hello mother im in philadelphia im going to give a talk at the art school downtown tomorrow so terry and this film crew are here with me theyd like to come over and drop me off there and talk possibly to charles about maybe filming him if youre not he doesnt want to do it okay all right thats okay doesnt matter not if you dont want him to i certainly wont all right bye well thats that i start with this one because its probably the thing im most wellknown for you could see it for a long time on truck mud flaps i dont know why it caught the popular imagination it caused me nothing but headaches for ten years after i drew it lawsuits and irs problems it was a nightmare just because of this stupid ‘‘keep on truckin’’ so dont anybody come to me and say ‘‘hey r keep on truckin’’ this is probably the next thing im most wellknown for im trying to hook you in to who i am this sold millions of copies i got 600 from cbs records in 1968 and they kept my artwork they stole my artwork those bastards i heard recently that the original of this sold at sothebys for 21000 this is the third thing im the most wellknown for because this was made into a major fulllength animated cartoon which was an embarrassment to me for the rest of my life i have to say i had nothing to do with the cartoon i didnt want them to do it i thought they were schlockmeisters they just rolled right over me so i had this character killed in a later story i had a female ostrich stab him in the head with an ice pick when i first met him he never talked he just drew he was catatonic and the only voice he had was his pen he was very productive my mother thought he was retarded when she met him she said ‘‘some people like cripples some like retards’’ she thought i was a real creep when she first met me hes more comfortable after knowing the same people for a long time hes a little more communicative but still he clams up he gets stilted in his conversation around anybody he doesnt know well thats why im such an exciting subject for a movie right watch out with those weights dont hit me with those things dont go behind me these rich rednecks have moved out here and built their dream homes on the top of every single hill there used to be nothing over here then these people bought this property they might hear you look at this house not too loud right above our house looks right into roberts studio be quiet i dont care if they hear me couldnt be any ruder than them putting their house right above mine what do i care i guess not since were moving to france what do you care they have a plan to widen this road and put it through where these trees are theres a big x that the surveyors sprayed on here and i erased it the other day then i took out their sticks from the other side of the road theyre going to widen this road and take a big chunk of land out of that side with all these trees put 12 dream homes back in there we decided to chain ourselves to these oak trees if they try and take them out our house is so humble nestled against the hill tasteful all these other houses are oriented to look down at our place because its like a backdrop for their airconditioned nightmare houses each hilltop can view each other hilltop the shmucks im drawing portraits of girls i had crushes on in high school in delaware this one im drawing now is winona newhouse affectionately known among the boys as ‘‘the shelf’’ she had this phenomenal rear shelf she was nice too actually she was kind to me this one here naomi wilson was this crosseyed farm girl that wore homemade clothes i secretly had a crush on her i was sexually attracted to her of course youd never dare admit it openly that you like this funky girl that had bo and hairy legs thats jean strahle i liked her too she was also considered a dork she was a bookwormy type that talked with a lisp and had shapely powerful legs i never actually had any contact with these girls except i used to play footsie with this one where are they now thirty years ago theyre all middleaged housewives now jesus what a thought winona i wish she was here now this 17yearold winona instead of this film crew when i listen to old music its one of the few times i actually have a kind of love for humanity you hear the best part of the soul of the common people its their way of expressing their connection to eternity or whatever you want to call it modern music doesnt have that calamitous loss people cant express themselves that way anymore it was late 1948 when i was five years old we moved to this section of philadelphia this is this project that we lived in i cant remember which we lived in they all look the same jesus its grim here oh my god this is where we went to the market there was a dime store that sold toys there we used to buy candy and stuff and comic books the three brothers me charles and maxon hung around together a lot wed rummage for stuff in the dump one time charles brought this thing back from the dump it was this beautiful wooden truck like an ice cream truck made of wood i wanted it really bad he wouldnt let me touch it he was spiteful that way so i made a big fuss and i told my mother she said ‘‘charles let him play with that’’ he said ‘‘okay’’ about 15 minutes later he said ‘‘okay you can play with it now’’ i ran outside and he had smashed it to smithereens against the wall charles you read any good books lately yeah i guess i have i dont know you seem to be recycling a lot of these books what do you mean by ‘‘recycling’’ you read them 20 years ago now youre reading them again im reading them again yeah i do that because theres nothing else to do youve read them all you ever read anything new i havent read kant or hegel you have any interest in that stuff maybe ill get around to reading them you read any recent writers not really no not interested in them most arent that good or interesting theyre not as interesting as the victorian writers of the late 19th century i always kind of envied your life in a way my life has become so hectic why because i was so detached from the human race is that one of the reasons why you envy me this cloistered environment with your books believe me its nothing to envy charles started this comic thing he was completely obsessed with comics when we were kids and had absolutely no other normal kid interest he wasnt interested in toys or games he didnt play sports he didnt do anything but read comics draw comics think comics and talk them i like drawing but i had other drawing interests besides comics i liked to draw realistic scenes just pictures of buildings and cars and stuff he wasnt interested in that at all it was only comics this is the earliest one that still exists that i have charles drew this thats supposed to be me and thats him you made me feel absolutely worthless if i wasnt drawing comics i dont think i would have done that i dont think i was as far gone as that maybe i was just unconsciously imitating the old man what was he like my father was an overbearing tyrant yes he was maybe i was unconsciously imitating him when i forced you to draw comic books theres still a kind of sibling rivalry between me and robert like there was when we were kids and he was still living at home i think basically robert and i are still competing with each other its like when im drawing comics i still think of charles approval whether or not hes going to like them charles had everybody drawing comics in the family ‘‘the animal town publishing company’’ that was a club we had where we sat around and talked about comics i was usually the president robert was usually the vice president carol was usually the secretary and sandy was the treasurer and maxon was the supply boy and he still resents that he still resents the fact we imposed the role of supply boy on him max crumb in room 310 maxon was the scapegoat in the family of five kids he was definitely on the bottom of the heap just to explain we had these meetings for this club charles put together called the animal town comics club something to do with comics everybody had their job a secretary a president a vice president i was supply boy i got it more heavy or direct than robert but there was the whole thing it was like a crazy sibling thing between me charles and robert in this room upstairs and the world didnt know what the fuck was going on it was like three primordial monkeys working it out in the trees me and maxon slept in the same bed until we were 16 or something very intimate close situation charles was inspired by the disney movie where robert newton plays long john silver after we saw it on tv in 1955 we started playing pirates like normal kids do wed go out and pretend we made this ship out of an old refrigerator carton charles would walk around town dressed up like long john silver he had this old coat of my mothers this long green coat he made himself a threecornered hat out of some womans hat he had a crutch and hed tie up his leg and go around town that way i didnt realize how fixated charles was on ‘‘treasure island’’ till years later this thing dominated our play and our fantasy for six or seven years we drew these comics about ‘‘treasure island ’ and it became this real baroque elaborate thing way beyond the original disney film this is one of charles this is one of our twoman comics in which he would draw some of the characters and i would draw some and have them interact that was a great school of cartooning for me having to come up with clever retorts to him he was actually much cleverer and funnier than i was it got tiresome but you had to do it he was in charge i had this very definite bad problem about charles i think a lot of it had to do with my morbid sensitivity to the guy as well as his natural affinity to get in there and profit off it robert was somewhat of a middleman it had this way of restricting or causing this terrible selfconsciousness in me as a kid i was morbidly modest about my body sex was completely removed when it came time for me to become sexually aware when i was in puberty sex was nowhere near in my life i had absolutely nothing to do with it sex was so heavily repressed thats when the seizures started i had a seizure and a seizures like a point where your behavior becomes id have to get into the whole sex trip which is an awful involved topic all i thought about when i was in my late teens and early 20s was sex i masturbated about four or five times a week how frequently did you i dont masturbate anymore now that my sexual desires are completely dead like i told you i cant get an erection anymore my god i dont know whether its one thing or a combination of things maybe a combination of the medication and lack of external stimulation maybe approaching old age has something to do with it who knows you need some external stimulation to keep up your interest now that my sexual desires are gone im not sure i want them back again my earliest sexual memories i remember being like four years old and getting erections i guess my aunt or my mothers sister humping her legs and her shoes like under the table i remember going in my mothers closet she had cowboy boots she wore when it rained and humping those in the closet and i remember singing while doing it ijesus loves me this i knowi ifor the bible tells me soi i remember when i was about five or six i was sexually attracted to bugs bunny i cut out this bugs bunny off the cover of a comic book and carried it around with me in my pocket and took it out and looked at it periodically it got wrinkled from handling i asked my mother to iron it to flatten it out she did and i was deeply disappointed because it got all brown and brittle and it crumbled apart what was it about bugs bunny that you found exciting i had this sexual attraction to cute cartoon characters you tell me i dont know that all changed when i turned 12 and i became fixated on sheena ‘‘sheena queen of the jungle ’ a tv show around 55 56 i became totally obsessed with sheena and went to bed every night thinking about the things i wanted to do with sheena robert was very hung up on sex when he was a little kid even more so than i was i was you think so yeah you were more inhibited as a child than i was even sexually you were more afraid of women than i was as a young person when i was in high school i had a few dates with girls when you were in high school you didnt have any dates with anybody you were actually sort of goodiooking i was a handsome goodiooking chap when i was a teenager but there was just something that was wrong with my personality the teachers hated him the kids hated him high school was an absolute nightmare i was the most unpopular kid in the high school people were always picking on me and beating me up and the girls wouldnt have anything to do with me they treated me like i was the scum of the earth in this strip im talking all about my problems with women starting with high school where i learned a lot about women because there was this guy named skutch this guy here who was like this mean bully but he was also very charming all the girls liked him he was the dreamboat but he was also a bully my brother charles was one of the guys he singled out for particular attention he had this gang of flunkies that hung around with him with skutch so i remember this scene where skutch punches out my brother in the hallway at school it was a very sad sight for me to see charles gave up trying to be popular or have girlfriends after everybody saw he couldnt fight back that he was beat up by skutch ive been living at home since i graduated from high school i made a few feeble attempts along the way youre no worse off than people that are in the world and have to deal with it but you got to take into consideration that im taking tranquilizers and that makes it a lot easier than it would otherwise be by taking these tranquilizers and antidepressants if it wasnt for them id probably go completely crazy living with mother i have to walk on eggs when im around her yeah you do you cant tell my mother the absolute truth shes in a heavy state of denial about a lot of things i dont think we should be talking about this wheres my kitty cats about her mother shes what the hells going on she doesnt like you to talk about her mother who was a complete monster what fix that thing in the hallway what thing the window whats wrong with it its some film equipment or something its some kind of film equipment where are my kitty cats i dont know dont worry about it its all gonna be out of here and back to normal here it shows these girls talking about how one of their friends got a date with skutch and how envious they all are this is how i felt about it im a little bitter about it as you can see i show here how i thought that most teenage boys are very cruel and aggressive and if girls could see that i was more kind and sensitive they would like me they were kind of impressed by the fact i could draw i couldnt understand why they liked these cruel aggressive guys and not me i was more kind and sensitive more like them i didnt realize they didnt want you to be like them basically i felt very hurt and cruelly misunderstood because i considered myself talented and intelligent and yet i was not very attractive physically i didnt think those things mattered it was whats inside that was important when i was 13 and 14 and trying to be a normal teenager i was really a jerk i tried to act like i thought they were acting it came out all wrong and weird so then i stopped completely and became a shadow i wasnt even there people werent aware that i was in the same world they were in that freed me completely because i wasnt under pressures to be normal so i got interested in oldtime music and went to the black section of town knocking on doors and looking for old records and things like that that would be unthinkable if you were going to be a normal teenager starting about 17 i started being driven by that obsession that ‘‘ill go down in history as a great artist thatll be my revenge’’ this is my image celebrating valentines day ‘‘february 13 1962 i decided to reject conforming when society rejected me ive heard all about that be yourself stuff when im myself people think im nuts guess ill have to be satisfied with cats and old records girls are just utterly out of my reach they wont even let me draw them’’ all that changed after i got famous absolutely i would love to pose for you excellent anytime you want to come by and visit thatd be really nice excellent i always wanted to see you again some of the early ‘‘weirdo’’ collages and also some publications we managed to track them down i think crumb is basically the brueghel of the last half of the 20th century there wasnt a brueghel of the first half but there is of the last half and that is robert crumb because he gives you that tremendous kind of impassion of lusting suffering crazed humanity in all sorts of bizarre gargoylelike allegorical forms hes got this very powerful imagination which goes over the top a lot but it very seldom lies hes mr natural he accepts women how they really are and makes them even more beautiful than they really like that woman i mean shes really shes got energy form and drive you cant push these women around theyre not wimps he gives power to women he made it okay for me to have a butt he did a drawing of me which i really liked a lot it was neat it showed my thighs as they really are he helped me change my selfimage i had felt so inadequate before it was like i didnt know believe me stevayne youre adequate oh youre so adequate i feel roberts work is one of the most pertinent social portraits of an era touching issues related to politics to sex to drugs to religion to the fine arts and i would say robert is the daumier of our time hes a very remarkable artist indeed the tradition that i see him belonging to is essentially the one of graphic art as social protest social criticism which of course has extremely long roots there are elements of goya in crumb goyas sense of monstrosity comes out in those menacing birdheaded women of crumbs for instance robert in front of all these people the undergrounds are alive and well whole industry sprung up theyre still reprinting the early ones number two number four god only knows how many of those have been printed by now ‘‘puke and explode ’ its called ‘‘puke and explode’’ thats new who put that out i dont know about these kids today i guess you really started all this you created this whole thing youre responsible i dont like to take credit for that some of this stuff i know nobody would im a really big fan of yours im wondering if theres any chance i can get an autograph from you i dont think so i dont believe in giving autographs okay well thanks anyway when are you actually moving couple months france isnt perfect or anything but its slightly less evil than the united states i think but thats not why im moving talk to my wife if you want to know why im moving we do have something here that we wanted to show you yeah yeah 1967 rock concert poster extremely rare item it’s my only rock concert poster i ever did theres this legend i keep hearing people telling me ‘‘somebody told me you used to live with the grateful dead in haight ashbury and you hung around with jerry garcia ’ i never had anything to do with those guys i hated that music i went to a couple of those rock concerts and just fell asleep found it completely boring that psychedelic music ive got something for you i want to tell you a little secret its called ‘‘om mani padme hum’’ this is where i get recognized more than anyplace in the world on haight street amazing i know these are my people people come to me and say ‘‘r crumb’’ sometimes some guy will sit with me and chew my ear off about all his hopes and dreams usually its some brokendown hippiepest guy its never like a beautiful young 20yearold girl its just so interesting to come here and draw people thats the main reason i come here just to watch people that girl was sitting here one day beautiful girl i drew this other girl she came up and wanted the drawing so i cut it out gave it to her good way to meet girls right i drew this girl she invited me to her house unfortunately she wasnt very attractive you kept the picture i see its ironic that youre so identified with the 60s at the time it didnt seem you fit in with that flower child thing i tried i used to come here every day and try and be one of them my main motivation was get some of that free love action but i wasnt too good at it people would ask ‘‘are you a narc’’ they would move away from you at the lovein i look like i do now exactly you in effect you did have a costume it wasnt the right costume i remember janis joplin giving me this piece of advice ‘‘crumb whats the matter with you dont you like girls’’ i said ‘‘of course i like girls what do you think’’ she said ‘‘just let your hair grow long get a satin billowy shirt velvet jackets and bell bottoms and platform shoes youll do all right’’ i just couldnt do that the whole thing was too silly to me i couldnt get with it heres a real beautiful one i should get the work in this book the art the feelings are what made me fall in love with robert the way he saw colors and the way he saw women when i was 17 years old i looked a lot like that so i was what he had been drawing i was the embodiment of what he had been drawing for years its such a sweet romantic vision of things he did this book it took him i think a year that was his life he had just finished the book days before we met my parents were always fighting all the time i used to say ‘‘im never getting married’’ my father said ‘‘youll marry the first one that comes along’’ he was right robert always had a sketchbook or two going he was constantly drawing if we were in a restaurant hed draw on the place mat if we were on the bus hed draw on his bus ticket i had this big change in 1965 and 66 it was visionary very powerful kind of knockyouonyourass visionary experience this is my sketchbook for 1966 that covers that period i took this very weird drug supposedly it was lsd but it had a really weird effect it made my brain all fuzzy this effect lasted for a couple of months i started getting these images cartoon characters like this that id never drawn before with these big shoes and everything i let go of trying to have any coherent fixed idea about what i was doing i started being able to draw these streamofconsciousness comic strips just kind of making up stuff it didnt have to make any sense it could be stupid it didnt make any difference all the characters that i used for the next several years came to me during this period these fit into this vision i was having it was a revelation of some seamy side of americas subconscious when i was drawing this there was this young girl she was 11 she said ‘‘isnt that cute’’ to me it was like a horror show this whole thing and she thought it was really cute and happy looking to me it was like a drawing of the horror of america there were these hippie underground papers starting up in 66 67 every town had one or two of them they would print anything if it was related to the psychedelic experience or the hippie ethic so i started submitting these lsdinspired comics i had been doing to these papers and they liked them then this guy came who suggested i do a whole issue of his paper it was called ‘‘yarrowstalks’’ i did that and that went over big he said ‘‘why dont you do psychedelic comic books and ill publish them’’ so i set to work and i did two whole issues of ‘‘zap comix’’ crumb was incredibly exciting and incredibly hot there were just a handful of us doing this new form of comics and what he was doing was just more innovative than what any of us had even thought of it was fun to be a part of that and to see ‘‘zap’’ suddenly everywhere from this concept of roberts this fantasy of doing his own comic book with a glossy cover and actually printed to seeing it turning up in all the windows on haight street around town hearing people talk about it having the other artists show up and wanting to be a part of it it happened very quickly it seems to me it happened in a matter of weeks crumb gave the ownership of ‘‘zap’’ to the artists there was no editor there was a certain point where it seemed underground comics could get into the big time and crumb always seemed reluctant to push that sort of thing they were offering him 100000 bucks just to start talking robert turned it down in two seconds aline screamed in the background ‘‘what are you doing we need money’’ forget it im not going on ‘‘saturday night live’’ the rolling stones wanted me to do an album cover a couple other deals like that i said ‘‘no’’ this is not something you see every day in america where selling out is everybodys ambition after about a year of recognition and all the bullshit of fame i just said ‘‘fuck it’’ and i started drawing the dark part of myself again in the comics which id always kept hidden before i was used to what he had been doing which was really quite sweet then he did this one that was just incredibly hostile to women very sexually hostile i wasnt expecting it i was really shocked and taken aback and just kind of like whack its hard for me to believe that he cant channel himself into doing better work i like a lot of his work and i dont miss the satirical aspect of it then i have a different reaction perhaps one of being really turned off and disgusted and you know this cartoon ‘‘joe blow’’ is one that i thought about a lot in that light on the one hand its a satire of a 1950s the healthy facade of the american family it kind of exposes the sickness under the surface but at the same time you sense that crumb is getting off on it himself in some other way on another level its a selfindulgent orgy in a fantasy and the fantasy specifically this story is a story about a father who commands his daughter to give him a blow job she does and they wind up having sex and the little leaveittobeaver type brother comes running in and sees the father and his sister and hes shocked he runs to the mother to tell her and mom comes out of a closet wearing a sort of sm getup and the little boy says ‘‘oh cool’’ the next thing mom and son are having sex the whole cartoon ends with the parents saying ‘‘gee we should spend more time with the kids ’ very funny so you read something like this and i think that it has gone over the line from satire of a 1950s hygienic family in denial into something which is just crumb producing pornography i think this theme in his work is omnipresent its part of an arrested juvenile vision crumbs material comes out of a deep sense of the absurdity of human life at a certain psychic level there arent any heroes villains or heroines even the victims are comic its this which people in america find rather hard to take because it conflicts with their basic feelings that sort of mixture of utopianism on one hand and puritanism on the other which is only another kind of utopianism which has given us the kind of messy discourse that we have today so crumb like all great satirists is an outsider in his own country jesus the fucking raging epithet music coming out of every car every store every persons head if they dont have noisy radios they got earphones on like ‘‘motherfuckin cock suckin son of a bitch’’ thats a lot of aggression a lot of anger a lot of rage everybodys walking advertisements theyve got advertisements on their clothes go walking around with ‘‘adidas’’ written across their chests or ‘‘49ers’’ on their hats jesus its pathetic its pitiful the whole cultures one unified field of bought sold marketresearched everything it used to be people fermented their own culture it took hundreds of years and it evolved over time thats gone in america people now dont even have any concept that there ever was a culture outside of this thing thats created to make money whatevers the biggest latest thing theyre into it you just get disgusted after a while with humanity for not having more kind of like intellectual curiosity about whats behind all this jive bullshit charles and i talk quite a bit about things we dont talk that much yeah we do we hold aloof from each other for the most part you spend all your time watching television and doing your crossword puzzles i dont watch television i turn it on because it puts me to sleep its a good way to get to sleep were two recluses living in the same house i wake up at 300 am and its still on you do most of the talking in the relationship mother theres no doubt about that you told me that even though you take medication you still feel depressed yeah but not as much as i would if i wasnt taking the medication what would happen if you stopped taking that stuff i dont know i tried it a couple of times and i didnt like what was starting to happen to me he gets insomnia i felt i was becoming unhinged so i got back on them in a big hurry i tried this a couple of times about two or three times do you still think theyre picking my brain mother yeah you have nothing to hide nothing to be ashamed of hes a good person people like charles you know some people like me and some dont im a very quiet wellbehaved citizen ive gone from one extreme to another youve gone in a complete circle you used to make trouble on the streets one of the last times i went out with you we were walking around and you went up to some old lady on the street and started drilling her about her spiritual life and she got frightened and threatened to call the police charles goes up to these strangers on the streets starts raving at them he was just a kid having fun this was when he was about 30 no he wasnt hes still doing that kind of stuff now he doesnt leave the house he got in trouble whenever he went out will you give me one good reason for leaving the house at least hes not out taking illegal drugs no hes taking legal drugs im taking legal dope or being married and making some woman miserable this is true one thing that kind of i spent all this money and hes got these 200 teeth upstairs and he wont wear them theyre too uncomfortable at first you gotta leave them in there then you dont know theyre there i never go anywhere see anybody what does he need them for to chew food or what pride in his own appearance he never goes out what does he care what he looks like i take a bath about once in six weeks i believe in having a certain pride in yourself in a way not that your ego gets out of hand and youre an egomaniac pride cant exist except in relation to other people yeah thats right i dont know your hygiene habits are pretty good im never constipated thats about all i can say for myself thats something you dont have hemorrhoids then youre doing good your father used to have trouble that way with constipation he was constipated all the time you were really obsessed with i could say something but i wont you always gave us kids castor oil you were obsessed with constipation when all you kids were real little i had to take care of you by myself that period where you used to try giving us all enemas that didnt work i never gave you enemas somebody you always threatened to give us enemas if we didnt behave properly i did not somebody tried to give me an enema she wouldnt admit it but that its not a regular suburban house its a suburban house that looks like ‘‘whatever happened to baby jane’’ or something she has weird trinkets around she has cats the whole place smells like pee dont say that on the film she doesnt want people in the house the next thing my mother knows this whole crew is filing in the door ‘‘oh no pictures no way jose’’ she says terry says ‘‘no were going upstairs were gonna do it in charles room’’ of course then she got into it and after a while you couldnt shut her up she talked on she chattered on and on it was awful what year is this 1970 id just met you this is when i first met you in 1969 thats me i remember that this doesn’t look like me youre right let me touch it up the nose is too bulbous the eyes are too far apart also its too late now really this was 18 years ago god it just how about this drawing of you i remember we were in this restaurant this is ridiculous oh good im still rolling she almost fell off the roof but she cant see the notebook thats me thats you with your hair dryer theres terry thats me i like that drawing thats one of the few drawings i liked so youre going to sell these books and i dont get a percentage this whole case of sketchbooks im giving to this guy for a house in france i had a lot of drawings here what do i get out of this what drawings several i drew that no aline drew those you sure i drew that no aline drew those really thats aline when i first knew her you went from this page where i was on it and like two pages later its aline how did that happen it was a crazy period thats disgusting thats horrible thats you and thats aline oh jesus you really hated women then do you think its improved since yeah i hate them a little bit less now guys like me i like certain kinds of womens legs im not masochistic but you dont like feet youre not heavily into feet im not fixated but i can get into it i can have an orgasm playing with someones foot its not a real narrow fixation its that the way the mind of the person who’s interested in legs and feet is very different from the mind of the person whos interested in breasts breast men tend to be aggressive outgoing athletic people who like the lower body shes got these types categorized people who like the lower body tend to be frightened introverted it all has to do with being down on the floor when you were a scared child and looking up at that big tower of mommy whats down there the feet and legs thats where the security is women go around feeling victimized by men all the time they feel like the men have the power and the area where women can take the power from men is through sex men have that fetishistic twist to their minds because they have that ability to concentrate on one thing to the exclusion of all else and can really be manipulated sexually where women are not as susceptible you are so frightening jesus women are susceptible to power thats what i find any display of power and ‘‘oh hes so interesting whos that man whos being so obnoxious and arrogant hes so interesting’’ im a career pornographer ive been at it for 16 years it was what i was always destined for i always loved pornography ii took my birthday moneyi iwhen i turned 18 because i was legali iand went to the adult bookstorei iand bought pornographyi ii went through some other jobs i ibut always sexualized themi iso finding pornographyi iwas just right i iim the editor of ‘‘jugs’’ ‘‘leg show’’i iand ‘‘bust out’’ right nowi ii was also the creatori iof ‘‘big butt’’ magazinei weve arranged with roberti ito do a photo shoot todayi iwhich will appeari iin ‘‘leg show’’ magazinei we’re going to have four or five womeni iwho we think robert will likei ibut theres never any tellingi iwith robert crumbi heres a girl i wish i couldve gotten for the crumb shoot this is a motherdaughter dominance team from la ‘‘mother taught me to smother’’ is this girls motto were doing this for the christmas issue the mothers wearing a red outfit we wanted them to do something festive hes a person that would rather be a brain in a jar that a person in a body basically we both focus on my body sexually roberts not too oriented towards normal sex there wasnt much in the way of normal sex in our relationship but lots of piggyback rides and wrestling around he liked to sit on my shoe a lot he never takes his shirt off he likes to not exist robert is an admitted compulsive masturbator he masturbates four or five times a day he told me he masturbates to his own comics im sure picasso did i think probably yeah some do but i dont think many artists give you such a wide range of masturbatory possibility as crumb that is if you like what he likes does he do that robert doesnt exaggerate anything in his comics the woman are exactly the way he wants them and he accurately portrays himself as the skinny bad posture myopic man he is some people wonder if he doesn’t exaggerate the size of his penis which appears awfully big in the comics robert does not exaggerate anything he is endowed with one of the biggest penises in the world why do i have my particular sexual proclivities i dont know ask a psychiatrist i dont know what its about i always thought robert was just kidding about them you thought i was kidding that he was trying to be funny yeah thats right i couldnt imagine how anyone could be serious about these things it was complete chaos this relationship the crying and fighting started soon actually you cried the third time id been with you whats so horrible about crying why is that painful to you ‘‘oh my god how can i deal with it what should i do shes crying’’ so youre saying that 20 years later you still have no idea what you were doing that couldve contributed to that no i guess i dont it was confusing because he was totally irresponsible he would call and say ‘‘i love you miss you cant wait to see you’’ he was supposed to be 200 miles away hed say ‘‘ill see you in a week or two’’ id go out to buy groceries two hours later and see him with another woman then hed wonder why i kicked him or got mad do you think im sadistic he would always act like he was passively a victim i used to call it his ‘‘ashley wilkes’’ routine that he would pull where he was just this passive victim of circumstance in other peoples desires when really he was just trying to get away with whatever he could and walking all over people i walked all over people like who you you think you were a good guy a nice boyfriend to me at the time i think im not a very romantic person thats all i dont think ive ever actually been in love i have many letters where you said ‘‘i love you’’ hundreds of times i was abusing the word i had this overpowering im leaving i was very fond of you ouch i was fond of you and had this overpowering lust for you that you could possibly imagine but i wouldnt say i was in love i just dont have it in me ive never been in love or jealous thats horrible the only woman ive ever been in love with is sophie my darling daughter you made me mess up i did books in the 70s that were selfdeprecating my selfhatred was really intense then did you ever see this one ‘‘twisted sisters ’’ nice cover i show myself on the toilet it got no recognition nobody bought it i asked the publisher how it was doing he said he was using it for insulation in the walls of his barn what is the gist of your comics what are they like about me my sex life my phobias what a disgusting human being i think i am your mothers featured in it a lot too its the way i can tolerate my mother is by drawing really hideous drawings of her like this for example after sophie was born my mother visited me she was so irritating and so unhelpful it talks about how she couldnt hold the baby cause shed had her nails wrapped my mother yells in the restaurant ‘‘got any sweet n low dear’’ a quiet fernbar restaurant in san francisco and every person turned around to look she came to the airport in an afro dressed up in this trendy outfit robert and i looked like immigrants just off the boat is your father on the bottom there thats my mothers husband she had him dressed in a leisure suit when she first met him he wore baggy brown suits he had short hair and he was fat she put him on a diet and put him in safari outfits and made him grow sideburns but he was still ‘‘shlubby’’ he had ‘‘shlubby’’ posture but he was ‘‘trendily’’ dressed kind of follows along after her like that what does she think about your comics she doesnt see them shes not interested she doesnt know youre a cartoonist unconsciously she must know theres things she doesnt want to know about and she doesnt take in very much about anybody anyway shes not too interested she saw this painting and a bunch of other paintings and she said ‘‘those are nice who did them’’ i said ‘‘i did’’ she said ‘‘i didnt know you painted’’ i mean she sent me to art school you just change the subject ‘‘what are we having for dinner’’ one thing youve learned is the importance of black thats good thanks pop okay enough why did you choose this figure in particular i like these photos theyre powerful for some reason this one was easy to draw finally picked attractive ones some of them are ugly you know shes a mess yeah she is the text talks about her being an alcoholic reprobate they picked her up off the street this one oh god looks like a monster in my drawing of her i made her cuter than she really is because i acquired the cuteness curse when i worked at american greetings which i cant shake you got the tilt of her head right thats hard to do you have to really the proportions of this to this is it the same or shorter i did a lot of erasing at first you havent learned how to cheat yet to get the desired effect you want like what draw over the top of a xerox you want to capture a certain thing about this womans face a certain defiance you see in there yeah i didnt get it exaggerate those little things that give her that look like the way her teeth slightly show shes got a slight sneer i try to do that but its hard with pencil just exaggerate cheat a little like the tilt of the head and the sneer you would emphasize that you have to consciously make a decision of what you want to bring out in the face i did that here but it still didnt work out its very subtle in that photo its very subtle my drawing doesnt capture the hate it does in a way youve got that open mouth thats the key to the thing that sneer you know baring the teeth yeah thats key they obviously ordered her to sit down and dont move theyre going to take her picture and just sit there you can see she doesnt like it itd be good if you could take life drawing you didnt go to art school and look youre rich and famous were not talking about rich and famous we’re talking about learning to draw a lot of my recent works appear in this ‘‘weirdo’’ magazine these are the kind of guys who read my work its an ode to the weirdo reader the hurt sensitive guy who doesnt fit in with the normal people like these people shes saying ‘‘i always hated the three stooges’’ of course he loves the three stooges this is my source material i couldnt find pictures in magazines of ordinary modern street scenes in america so i persuaded this guy in sacramento to spend a day with me driving around cause i dont drive and couldnt do it myself just to take snapshots of ordinary street corners in modern america this has been indispensable to me you cant remember these things to draw these modern light poles and crap all this junk on every suburban street ive used it in a lot of places its background here stuff like that in my story here i used it also this whole background this stuff i put it over here you cant make up this crap its too complicated on this cover i used a bunch of photos to take that stuff in the real world this stuff is not created to be visually pleasing its just accumulation of the modern industrial world people dont even notice they block it out robert and sophie dinners ready hurry up go sit down get out of here who me no her shes helping me now shes breakdancing get out of here come over here and get your plate hows that ill trade you the gum for the plate gotta have my starch and my fat look at all this food iits fun to eat supper with your familyi iespecially where there is good foodi ion the tablei iat least you could managei ito be on timei iyour mother goes to all the troublei ito prepare a fine meali i its only common courtesy chucki i i knowi ibut i couldnt help iti ii was late home from schooli once i reached adolescence it was the late 50s everybody i knew their families had nothing to do with the advertisement for itself that the culture was presenting on the tv screen i why not i i do i have to have a reason i i all your friends will be therei i i dont carei ichuck dont talki iwith your mouth fulli ichew your food welli ichew and chewi idoesnt it taste extra good that wayi the whole thing is a big false front that was suffocating and so dreary and depressing they grew up in the depression i understand they went through the war they wanted this thing that was so tight unthreatening and flat they wanted a dull lifestyle they wanted perry como they wanted this ozzie and harriet shell we grew up in the whole thing had this creepy nightmarish grotesque quality this is the first issue of ‘‘zap comix’’ that i did in late 1967 it was the beginning of all this underground comic nonsense it was all very lsd inspired a lot of these are things i redrew from sketchbooks this ‘‘whiteman’’ character a lot of this stuff i didnt realize when i was doing it what it was about or connected to i realized afterwards this is really about my father this rigid gungho american kind of guy a typical world war ii generation man when my father died in 82 my aunt gave me stuff my father had sent her one of the things was this book he wrote ‘‘training people effectively’’ im not sure what he did for a living in the last years of his life it had something to do with employee motivation for a corporation heres a photo i was reading about this syndrome in japan that japanese businessmen have something about some smiling disease where they have a fixed smile on their face all the time i think my father had that the article said it was a sign of deep depression he didnt smile when he was home the smile dropped as soon as he came home he was a grim guy he fought in the war and everything he had a hardass attitude about life and thought my mother was mollycoddling all of us which she was all three of his sons ended up being wimpy nerdy weirdos it broke his heart i think he wanted one of us to become a marine my father was hotheaded hed just blow his stack hed lash out and hit you real hard when i was five years old on christmas this whole thing happened where he blew his stack at me and busted my collarbone when you were five yeah charles had a penchant for getting in trouble he was diabolical as a kid and my father would beat him unmercifully for these things he was doing crimes he was committing it just made him worse i had this subconscious desire to be punished why it had something to do with my father it had something to do with being brought up by a sadistic bully theres some connection there between the two of them although im not really sure what it is what was your mom like when you were a kid she was an amphetamine addict the amphetamines would make her act crazy and do and say really crazy things it had an absolutely devastating effect i think on all five of us kids do you it had a devastating effect on me anyway how did your parents get along they got along well up until the time i was 9 or 10 years old but after beatie started taking amphetamines to keep her weight down they had a terrible time they were screaming and yelling at each other all the time morning noon and night shed scratch at the old mans face till it looked like ground hamburger he would put makeup on when he went to work in an attempt to cover up the scratches on his face the old man came to me and said ‘‘lf you dont go out and get a job i’ii make your life a hell on earth’’ thats exactly what he started to do to make my life a hell on earth so to get him off my back i took a job as a telephone solicitor for the ‘‘philadelphia inquirer’’ i stuck it out for a year because i was afraid of what he would do to me if i didnt thats the last time you held a job though right and it only lasted for a year that was back in 69 the old man was always trying to make productive citizens out of us when i was a teenager he forced me to use my drawing talent to draw pictures of houses then ask the people if they wanted to buy them that was the old mans idea wasnt it completely his idea he made me do it it was a hateful job when i first got wellknown he was proud of me he heard i was getting wellknown for my work but he never saw it i dont think he wouldve approved he wouldve disapproved of it on socalled ‘‘moral grounds’’ somebody told me that someone at work showed him one of my comics and thats when he stopped talking to me he wouldnt speak to me after he saw the stuff i was doing in the early 70s the story i had most trouble with is this one i got two pages into it and thought ‘‘this is too negative too twisted too upsetting i’ve gotta stop this’’ i quit working on it i threw the page in the garbage can at some point aline came into my studio for something and i decided ‘‘ill show her this and see what she thinks about it’’ so i pulled it out of the garbage can i said ‘‘what do you think about this i threw it away i didnt want to continue it its too weird too disturbing’’ she read it and said ‘‘you have to finish this youve got to see this through’’ i said ‘‘shes a woman she said i have to do it so ill do it’’ so flakey foont answers the door and theres a girls body standing there but what you see is mr naturals head and beard where her head should be thats how it starts flakey foont is confused by that and mr natural comes galloping in riding the girl around the room her bodys very frisky and you dont see her head at all you just see mr naturals beard where her head should be then she lands in a split and mr natural starts talking about what an amazing body this woman has but the head was always a problem cause she had such an obnoxious personality flakey foont is shocked and horrified when he sees she doesnt have a head mr natural explains ‘‘she was obnoxious so i got rid of the head you wanted her lusted after her now you can have her because her heads missing’’ then he explains how he took the head off and topped the neck with a cap then mr natural says he discovered that she had a second smaller brain in her butt and that is whats making the body function then he gives foont directions on how to feed her you take the cap off and put this funnel down her neck mr natural pulls out this mannequin head and says ‘‘lf you take her outside youve got to put this head on her so people arent shocked and horrified by a headless girl walking around’’ mr natural leaves and says ‘‘dont say i never did anything for you’’ he gives the girl to foont and foonts getting excited hes got this wondrous body all to himself to do with whatever he wants he says ‘‘i like it better with just the cap’’ he knocks the fake head off hes leading her to the wall and she accidentally steps on the fake head and smashes it he pushes her against the wall pulls her clothes off and hes admiring her firm butt this is the part where i get excited when im working on it i enjoy drawing the female form i make a lot of fuss to make sure the figure comes out the way i want it the males i dont care what they look like so he starts to fuck her he penetrates her from behind and hes getting really excited at the same time he feels guilty while hes in the middle of coming he imagines her severed head and then her face condemning him she says ‘‘you little shit’’ cut to mr natural hes home phones ringing ‘‘i got home an hour ago’’ yeah its foont hes feeling guilty foont wants to bring her back he cant handle it mr natural says ‘‘okay bring her over make sure you put the head back on before you take her outside’’ he realizes the heads been smashed he doesnt know what to do actually a lot of these poses in these panels i took from freezeframing the fly girls on ‘‘in living color’’ he ties up a shirt into a ball and puts it on top of the cap then he puts a hat on he pushes her in the car we cut to mr naturals house mr naturals saying hes going to regret it if he doesnt keep her mr natural says ‘‘forget it well put the head back’’ mr natural unscrews the clamp pulls the pipe out of her he reaches in this is probably the most sickening disturbing panel in the story aline says its the most disturbing part of the whole thing hes pulling hard and he pulls her head back out by her tongue her head was actually inside her body all the time foont is very shocked then relieved that her head is back mr natural says ‘‘old african witch doctor stuff nothing special’’ and she says ‘‘that was so weird’’ mr natural says ‘‘yep’’ then they both realize the heads back the troubles back she says what happened to her and what did mr natural do to her and where does he get his crazy ideas at this point foont feels guilty and starts apologizing to the devil girl for having done the deed to her when she didnt have her head she says ‘‘what are you saying ’ she realizes that mr natural handed her over to foont for him to play with she says ‘‘you gave me to that shmuck to play with as if i were a piece of meat’’ he says ‘‘what the hells the difference ’ he tries to get away and shes chasing him in the end shes raging with anger and she says ‘‘wheres a butcher knife im going to cut both your heads off’’ typical comic book ending i see a theme running through his work that is very frightening and its the woman with her head either cut off or somehow distorted something done to it so that nothing is left but the body and the body of course you can have sex with when crumb draws that little monster mr natural doing things you or i would not normally think of doing with a headless woman it is not intended i imagine to be apologia for beheading or an apologia for rape but it is an acknowledgement that these kinds of fantasy actually do dwell in homo sapiens theyre there im saying that its very irresponsible to put dangerous sexual fantasies on paper and make them available to the public its important for women to not just run in horror from pornographic images and immediately think they represent oppression and the power of men to degrade women and to think sometimes about the fact that they often are theyre fantasies of having power theyre fantasies of being able to dominate that come out of a fear of precisely the opposite fear of not being able to be attractive to women impotence fears and fears of powerlessness in general how do you feel about the way he depicts women in his comics he depicts his id in its pure form the dark side of human nature is in every person thats what i was drawn to in his work that he could illustrate that really clearly its unusual to see it i think its always there does any of that bother you hes not like that in other ways as a person he gets it out in his artwork he fools around with other women how do you deal with that i fool around with other men i have hostilities toward women i admit it its out in the open i have to put it out there sometimes i think its a mistake i should never have let it out id be more wellioved the whole thing would be easier and cleaner if i didnt let it out but its in there and its very strong and it ruthlessly forces itself out of me onto the paper for better or worse when i was 9 or 10 my brother collected ‘‘zap comix’’ when i saw those they really deeply deeply terrified me i was deeply upset i looked at them and thought ‘‘this is adulthood this is what adult women are this is what i grew up into ’ it was horrifying i wonder if you think about the effect on people who read it or what youre validating for boys i just hope that somehow revealing that truth about myself is somehow helpful i hope it is but i have to do it maybe i shouldnt be allowed maybe i should be locked up and my pencils taken away from me i just dont know i really cant say i cant defend myself i was with my daughter sophie watching ‘‘goodfellows’’ on videotape the violent part horrified her so deeply she started getting a stomach ache i shut it off wouldnt let her watch it i think its a great movie truthful movie i got a lot out of seeing it its obviously not for a kid sometimes certain harsh realities of life youve got to protect your kids a little bit from that they dont understand a lot of things yet not everythings for children not everythings for everybody have you gotten criticism about the way you draw black people oh yeah but it all came from white liberals heres an example of the kind of thing im talking about in ‘‘ooga booga’’ its actually a mockery of black people its a vomiting up of crumbs own racism his own deepest hostilities and fears if you have a kneejerk reaction and thats as far as you get then you say hes a racist but once you think about how hes toying with that how hes shoving it in your face you start to think about your attitudes and how the stereotypes came about and it gets complicated all that stuff i did in the late 60s i didnt really know what it was about when i did it it was very instinctive somehow lsd liberated me in this way that allowed me to put it down and not worry about what it meant i had a vague idea that it meant something but it was later that id look at it analyze it and see what its about somehow the term ‘‘nigger hearts’’ just came into my mind as a product its like its some black deep thing in american collective mind or something that has to do with turning everything over for a buck im not sure exactly but its some message like that quite a number of people these days would like this nice milky vision of culture in which its all improving and leads us all to this nice little pieinthesky moral heaven where nobodys nasty to anybody else but the only thing is that literature culture art isnt put there to have that pleasant normative effect conservatives like to think great works of art lead us towards democracy bull there were speeches in shakespeare that were so full of hatred for the mob theyre passionately elitist passionately antidemocratic what do you with someone like celine a nazi sympathizer yet a great novelist what do you do with practically anybody whos got a vision of the world not in accord with the present standards at berkeley theyre all wearing raiders and 49ers jackets sophie wants us to get her a 49ers jacket why do you want to live in the midst of it like hamlet im too scared to kill myself you gonna move to the south of france you gonna miss all this iii be out of here in a couple more months i cant live in it i cant take it they cant wait to have the money to get their hands on this stuff they live for it its a beautiful world you gonna finish this one soon it depends on when i have a chance to pick up an oil brush again you worked on this recently right did you do something to this recently when was the last time i painted i was working on that thing of dian that portrait of that new york floozie you were running with this one this is a portrait number you put things together and watch the paint do stuff how come you put that metalliciooking brassiere on her her personality was like that she had a hard armored personality she was a broad underneath it she would find that thing you put on her really disturbing it just reflects the personality an icy crazed expression in the eyes but theres a warmth and reluctance in the smile you know what i mean interesting shes in therapy now she is she doesnt need therapy she fucks too hard how do you cure that except by death you start from a blob when you do ink work you start from a line being fixated with like that one this is also an example of being fixated with line i started getting into very detailed you can see a very distinct line thing in the character of it youre pleased with this when you look at it now i like the style a lot this is van gogh shooting himself in a cornfield whats the corn about its like that walt whitman line ‘‘quintillions ripen and the quintillions green’’ he was out picking fruit a transient picker he came to this realization the abundance of the farm thing the abundance of plant growth he wrote this line ‘‘quintillions ripen and the quintillions green’’ the same thing with corn a stylized van gogh painting corn has infinite ability like primal nature whats with van gogh shooting himself his mind went to this place theres this infinite abundance like in an ear of corn this is the first oil painting you ever did isnt it its the first oil i ever did yeah you never drew before and it suddenly just came out of you its like something was released inside of you when i had that first epileptic fit in sixth grade i was drawing a picture of my face with charcoal in art class i said ‘‘hey you can draw’’ it started working out it was the first time i had this artistic experience it was so violent to me that i had a fucking seizure i ended up in the hospital the next day this is probably one of the last comic covers charles ever did it might be the very last one his psychotic bunny rabbits in our late teens i persuaded charles that we should send away for ‘‘the famous artists talent test’’ they had ads in magazines we each sent away for this test i did mine legitimately the way you were supposed to but charles couldnt help himself you were supposed to complete the figure by drawing a costume on it but he put pasties on her tits and started drawing weird psychotic characters in the background psychotic mickey mouse they had an outline of this barn and tree you were supposed to draw in textures on surfaces they gave suggestions on how to fill in the textures thats his interpretation of that here was your ability to arrange elements in a picture they give you objects youre supposed to make an arrangement so he did this and this ‘‘your imagination as an illustrator complete this picture by adding whatever other figure or objects you think are necessary’’ so he drew this girl here a week after this came in the mail a salesman showed up to grade our tests if you got a good grade you got the privilege of paying 400 to take the course he looked at charles at what he had done and he was speechless he didnt know what to say he told me mine was good i had a lot of potential and i should take the course but charles he wouldnt even speak to him he was pretty far gone at that point already this is some of his later work sort of the end of his comic period about 1961 hes about 18 he started developing this weird wrinkle technique in his drawing and it became stranger and stranger had nothing to do with the outside world at all became more and more ingrown in this way it had to do with his increasing alienation from the world isolation he never went to pen and ink he never got beyond pencil and crayons this is some of the last ‘‘treasure island’’ stuff he did this is late 61 its beautifully drawn except the wrinkle stuff gets out of hand he got more and more obsessed with that it gets real darklooking he had this fascination with the relationship between the kid and long john silver the pirate character which he elaborated on endlessly this is one of our twomans you can see he gradually added more and more text the writing takes over look at that he lost interest in drawing and then he went to this loony writing theres a certain phase of charles life that had this compulsive graphomania he did dozens of these notebooks he gave me a bunch of them people found them fascinating this is upside down though it doesnt make any difference i dont know if its upside down or right side up when he first started out it was readable and then it became less and less readable what i definitely need is some kind of external stimulation to rejuvenate me and get me going again but i dont know how im going to be able to arrange this eventually i dont know ill have to start doing that in a mental hospital i remember this time we were at neals house and mary was there mary said ‘‘im bored im gonna take a bath’’ she went in the bathroom and i told her not to do it maxons eyes glazed over and he got kind of red he got up as if he was in a trance and he went up to the bathroom i said ‘‘what are you doing’’ he pushed the bathroom door open mary was standing there naked and she screamed she slammed the door i said ‘‘maxon come away’’ i tried to pull him away from the door he was completely in a trance he pushed the door open again mary yelled again then maxon fell on the floor had an 8minute seizure whats with these oriental women you were into in this phase you were attracted to oriental women i was when i first started doing this when you were in that phase the phase of molesting women and getting in trouble with cops were you actually raping these women no i didnt get that much into it hed goose them and run away youve got to do a lot of molesting to get to rape if you do a couple years of molesting youii get to rape i started molesting when i was 18 i started with chinese women for some crazy reason on subways in philadelphia i went through different periods of it but im out of it its too much passion too much animal didnt they put you in some kind of psycho ward for a few weeks two weeks on haldol will cure anything youll do anything they tell you after two weeks on haldol for a sensible person its just terrible you get heavy into molesting its a violent crime thing i get to the point where i start pulling girls shorts down im walking around this district by the marina a shopping district this beautiful jewishlooking girl with obscenely brief shorts on goes into this drugstore im in a fit i gotta do this to this broad shes just too much ive gotta risk my whole life just to do something to this broad so i go in cold sweat all over the place she doesnt notice shes casually looking over some shampoo im trying not to be obtrusive she goes up to the counter its like this complete personal struggle about this moment i gotta pull this risky trip i walk up behind her while shes paying for the shampoo i grab the bottom of her shorts and go they go all the way down and her ass pops out like a ripe peach ‘‘jesus christ’’ she says ‘‘theres someone there ’ maybe 15 or 20 years from now ill be more willing to talk about it but not now ive still got too many scruples did you tell maxon about them he thinks youre putting it on charles confessed to me when we were adults that when we were teenagers he had to stifle the urge to stick a knife in my heart hed be lying in bed fighting the urge to go to the kitchen for the knife i wanted to go to the basement get an ax and bash your skull in i told maxon he didnt believe it he thought it was all part of the act he thinks the whole things an act he thinks my mental sickness is an act he thinks you have a cushy position in things because you got the mothers love and he didnt thats what he thinks he must think i have reasons for putting on this act what does he think those reasons are i dont think he thinks it out too deeply hes just reacting he still has anger and resentment because he wasnt loved by the mother i know what the homicidal tendencies stem from now it stemmed from an excessive degree of narcissism it seems all i have to do is overcome the excessive degree of narcissism and my homicidal tendencies will go away you still have these tendencies no theyre pretty well gone think its drugs whats the connection between narcissism and homicidal tendencies when narcissism is wounded it wants to strike back at the person who wounded it did i wound your narcissism many many times many many times im at the point in meditation where i have to use a bed of nails im not a great expert at the nails so i cover a portion of the nails with this thin bandana so its not too painful to me i have to regulate the amount of pain that i take with it how long can you sit on those i can sit a couple hours this is quite easy the cloth cleans your intestines out on the inside you might say it gratifies your intestines every six weeks regularly i have to pass it through my entire body and it takes three days for it to come out the other side you dont take the nails on the street right theyre prejudiced against people like in the financial district against someone praying in the street you go out with your beggar bowl about every day i do it every day once a day its part of my whole thing i have to go out and meet the public put the bowl down lock in and do it its a dirty job how long has he had this bed of nails a couple years he sits on it about three or four times a day about once a day for a couple hours does he sleep on it no its not big enough to sleep on he just sits on it where did he get it did he buy it you cant buy a bed of nails just a minute what is it what not too badly remember mother im under the influence of medication thats helping me through this thing to a certain extent anyway when did you start taking medication about 20 years ago if only it would do something about the inner anguish and pain you started taking it after you attempted suicide i started taking it after one of my suicide attempts you drank furniture polish that was the first time i drank a bottle of furniture polish and took an overdose of sleeping pills i chickened out at the last minute and went downstairs and asked mother to take me to the hospital to have my stomach pumped jesus there were two or three other attempts besides that one this morning you were talking about getting a lobotomy why not why not god its grim charles confessed to me that when he first saw ‘‘treasure island’’ in 1950 he developed this crush on bobby driscoll and it never went away bobby driscolls the kid who plays jim hawkins the root of this whole obsession was this kid that was in the movie he was drawing bobby driscoll this kid endlessly when he told me this i was shocked i had no idea thats what it was about i guess its caused him a lot of torment in his life hes never been able to have any real sexual life at all hes never had sex i dont think any of them got out mother when she yelled ‘‘get the hell out of here’’ i said ‘‘whos she talking to’’ and i said ‘‘shes being pursued by invisible enemies’’ who does she think they are i dont know exactly its hard to tell charles fix that curtain in the hallway the curtain in the hallway come here come here let me see that please let me show you the painter i did that one and that one that ones good let me show you what one it is this is my character thats your character what are biscuit teeth her dog biscuit teeth thats her dog leave it the way it is gimme a break isnt that better look much better everything has to be black and white everything has to be oldfashioned it just looks better like that the old man i think took off pretty much for good when i was probably five or six years old i guess i cant remember that period of time very well but i didnt see him too regularly after that he was over here for the most part madison dixon kind of gone most of the time i think he has sort of a hard time emotionally sometimes ill feel like i want to express affection to the old man i feel like i want to put my arm around him or shake his hand or get close in some way he cant do it how tight pretty tight what a disaster this is taking these records out i was planning to live here until i died i didnt want to move out of this place and move all these damn records thatll teach you to have a hobby be careful with those you break them ill kill you my copy of frank bunch and his fuzzy wuzzies put those there on that futon tight as you can pull it out and ill cut it jesus that wife of mine having me move to france for gods sake its too late now the die is cast a lot of stuff is in here and some of its in there pulling up to here would be the best thing i dont know well have to look we have plywood we can put down shes having a ball out there telling those guys what to do god giant trucks are here everything embarrassing you think those guys are going to be sensitive to my record collection bunch of football jocks ‘‘whaddya got here a bunch of old albums or somethin’’ is there anything youre going to miss about this country a certain relaxed quality that people have here that europeans dont have theyre more formal americas a big ‘‘slobville’’ i went to get my friend’s belongings in eureka it was at these peoples house i went into their living room they had this chair that was a gold plastic football helmet with a red and blue padded seat they had doublewide couches and a fourfoot tv screen with nintendo a ninja turtle game was on a giant fat teenager was sitting there mesmerized you dont see too much of that in france how do you feel about leaving your family here i dont have any feelings about it one way or the other what do i care never see that mother or brother anyway talks to them like once a year what about jesse hes devastated that were leaving on the other hand we told him he could come and stay with us there hes thrilled about that we gave him 500 for plane fare so hes going to come how about max max i feel bad about he doesnt have too many other people to talk to im probably his closest human relationship in the world these are all records those 78s you were talking about yep so ive got no patience for hollywood bullshit i cant think in those terms ive already got so much of my life wasted with those people down there animation forget it no im not interested in it at all there hasnt been a decent animated film made in this country since 1940 ‘‘cheery pop tart’’ is an abomination larry wells is an idiot its going to be a piece of garbage im not interested all right so long i was on a conference call with charles webb a friend of dan oneills theyre putting together the ‘‘cherry pop tart’’ film they got on the phone with some guy in la who says ‘‘hey im your kind of guy remember tommy toilet i love it’’ they want to make a movie the natural film of course its a ‘‘go’’ project this is how i felt after that last hell week of you filming me here ‘‘how perfectly goddamned delightful it all is to be sure’’ when i was a kid if i ever started showing enthusiasm for anything by brother charles would say ‘‘how perfectly goddamned delightful it all is to be sure’’ always take the wind out of my sails even though i dont see him often whenever im with him it revives that keen awareness of that of being very removed or extremely separated from the rest of humanity and the world in general i kinda like that feeling ‘‘how perfectly goddamned delightful it all is to be sure’’ fix it charles put back the towel the way i had it first put the towel up watch you dont pull the shade all the way off the thing i wont cant come in and disrupt peoples house like this where are the babies i dont know i think
