1
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,025
If I don't draw for a while,
I get really crazy.

2
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:16,194
I start feeling depressed and suicidal
if I don't get to draw.

3
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,467
But sometimes when I'm drawing,
I feel suicidal, too.

4
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,701
What are you trying to get at
in your work?

5
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,265
Jesus!

6
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,841
I don't know.

7
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,545
I don't work in terms of conscious
messages. I can't do that.

8
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,110
It has to be something...

9
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:38,487
I'm revealing to myself while
I'm doing it, which is hard to explain.

10
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,857
Which means that while I'm doing it,
I don't know exactly what it's about.

11
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:46,456
You have to have the courage
to take that chance.

12
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,467
What's gonna come out?

13
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,060
What's coming out of this?

14
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,071
I enjoy drawing.

15
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,597
It's a deeply ingrained habit.
It's all because of my brother Charles.

16
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,070
Hello, Mother?
I'm in Philadelphia.

17
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:08,152
I'm going to give a talk
at the art school downtown tomorrow.

18
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,782
So Terry and this film crew
are here with me.

19
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:16,386
They'd like to come over
and drop me off there...

20
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:20,091
and talk possibly to Charles...

21
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,964
about maybe filming him
if you're not...

22
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,438
He doesn't want to do it?
Okay.

23
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,966
All right.

24
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,739
That's okay.

25
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,302
Doesn't matter.

26
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,115
Not if you don't want him to.
I certainly won't...

27
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,054
All right. Bye.

28
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,821
Well, that's that.

29
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,895
I start with this one...

30
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:04,034
because it's probably the thing
I'm most well-known for.

31
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,104
You could see it for a long time
on truck mud flaps.

32
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,707
I don't know why it caught
the popular imagination.

33
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:15,550
It caused me nothing but headaches
for ten years after I drew it:

34
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,386
lawsuits and I.R.S. problems.

35
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,722
It was a nightmare just because
of this stupid ‘‘Keep on truckin’’.

36
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:25,025
So don't anybody come to me and say,
‘‘Hey, R.! Keep on truckin!’’

37
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,226
This is probably the next thing...

38
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,235
I'm most well-known for.

39
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,703
I'm trying to hook you in
to who I am.

40
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,003
This sold millions of copies.
I got $600...

41
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,841
from CBS records in 1968.

42
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:45,475
And they kept my artwork.
They stole my artwork, those bastards.

43
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,418
I heard recently
that the original of this...

44
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:52,481
sold at Sotheby's for $21,000.

45
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,727
This is the third thing
I'm the most well-known for...

46
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,130
because this was made into
a major full-length animated cartoon...

47
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,863
which was an embarrassment to me
for the rest of my life.

48
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,599
I have to say I had nothing to do
with the cartoon.

49
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,110
I didn't want them to do it.
I thought they were schlockmeisters.

50
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,907
They just rolled right over me.

51
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,077
So I had this character killed in a
later story. I had a female ostrich...

52
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:23,088
stab him in the head with an ice pick.

53
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,548
When I first met him,
he never talked, he just drew.

54
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,858
He was catatonic,
and the only voice he had was his pen.

55
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,296
He was very productive.

56
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,199
My mother thought he was retarded
when she met him.

57
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,966
She said, ‘‘Some people like cripples,
some like retards.’’

58
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,634
She thought I was a real creep
when she first met me.

59
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,545
He's more comfortable after knowing
the same people for a long time.

60
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,548
He's a little more communicative...

61
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,050
but still he clams up.

62
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,919
He gets stilted in his conversation
around anybody he doesn't know well.

63
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,480
That's why I'm such
an exciting subject for a movie.

64
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,992
Right.

65
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,801
Watch out with those weights.

66
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:14,602
- Don't hit me with those things.
- Don't go behind me.

67
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:18,235
These rich rednecks have moved out here
and built their dream homes...

68
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,302
on the top of every single hill.

69
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,510
There used to be nothing over here.
Then these people bought this property.

70
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,779
- They might hear you.
- Look at this house.

71
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:30,152
- Not too loud.
- Right above our house.

72
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,919
- Looks right into Robert's studio.
- Be quiet.

73
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,483
I don't care if they hear me.

74
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,928
Couldn't be any ruder than them
putting their house right above mine.

75
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,296
What do I care?

76
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:45,201
I guess not, since we're moving
to France, what do you care?

77
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:49,799
They have a plan to widen this road and
put it through where these trees are.

78
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,572
There's a big X that
the surveyors sprayed on here...

79
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,875
and I erased it the other day.

80
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:58,212
Then I took out their sticks
from the other side of the road.

81
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,218
They're going to widen this road...

82
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,414
and take a big chunk of land
out of that side with all these trees.

83
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,821
Put 12 dream homes back in there.

84
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:10,488
We decided to chain ourselves to these
oak trees if they try and take them out.

85
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:15,057
Our house is so humble
nestled against the hill. Tasteful.

86
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,729
All these other houses are oriented
to look down at our place...

87
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:22,707
because it's like a backdrop for
their air-conditioned nightmare houses.

88
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,336
Each hilltop can view
each other hilltop. The shmucks.

89
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:43,260
I'm drawing portraits of girls I had
crushes on in high school in Delaware.

90
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,490
This one I'm drawing now
is Winona Newhouse...

91
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,762
affectionately known among the boys
as ‘‘The Shelf’’.

92
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,736
She had this phenomenal rear shelf.

93
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,238
She was nice, too, actually.
She was kind to me.

94
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,410
This one here, Naomi Wilson...

95
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,606
was this cross-eyed farm girl
that wore homemade clothes.

96
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,447
I secretly had a crush on her.
I was sexually attracted to her.

97
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,510
Of course, you'd never dare
admit it openly...

98
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:12,957
that you like this funky girl
that had B.O. and hairy legs.

99
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:18,395
That's Jean Strahle. I liked her, too.
She was also considered a dork.

100
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,489
She was a bookwormy type
that talked with a lisp...

101
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,534
and had shapely, powerful legs.

102
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,627
I never actually had any contact
with these girls...

103
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,673
except I used to play footsie
with this one.

104
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,601
Where are they now?

105
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,906
Thirty years ago.

106
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,506
They're all middle-aged housewives now.
Jesus, what a thought.

107
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,381
Winona. I wish she was here now...

108
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,752
this 17-year-old Winona...

109
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,690
instead of this film crew.

110
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,762
When I listen to old music,
it's one of the few times...

111
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,432
I actually have a kind of love
for humanity.

112
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:05,375
You hear the best part of the soul
of the common people.

113
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,607
It's their way of expressing...

114
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,445
their connection to eternity
or whatever you want to call it.

115
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,918
Modern music doesn't have
that calamitous loss.

116
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:18,150
People can't express themselves
that way anymore.

117
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,669
It was late 1948...

118
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,176
when I was five years old, we moved
to this section of Philadelphia.

119
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,235
This is this project that we lived in.

120
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,805
I can't remember which we lived in.
They all look the same.

121
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,009
Jesus. It's grim here.

122
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,488
Oh, my God! This is where
we went to the market.

123
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,253
There was a dime store
that sold toys there.

124
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:12,025
We used to buy candy and stuff
and comic books.

125
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:16,535
The three brothers, me, Charles
and Maxon, hung around together a lot.

126
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:21,630
We'd rummage for stuff in the dump.

127
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,938
One time Charles brought this thing
back from the dump.

128
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,342
It was this beautiful wooden truck.

129
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,543
Like an ice cream truck made of wood.
I wanted it really bad.

130
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,848
He wouldn't let me touch it.
He was spiteful that way.

131
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,354
So I made a big fuss,
and I told my mother.

132
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,857
She said, ‘‘Charles,
let him play with that.’’

133
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,358
He said, ‘‘Okay.’’

134
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:46,057
About 15 minutes later, he said,
‘‘Okay, you can play with it now.’’

135
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:50,660
I ran outside, and he had smashed it
to smithereens against the wall.

136
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,880
Charles, you read
any good books lately?

137
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,789
Yeah, I guess I have.
I don't know.

138
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,928
You seem to be recycling
a lot of these books.

139
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,933
What do you mean by ‘‘recycling’’?

140
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,266
You read them 20 years ago.
Now you're reading them again.

141
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,498
I'm reading them again. Yeah.

142
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,804
I do that because
there's nothing else to do.

143
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,743
You've read them all.
You ever read anything new?

144
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,338
I haven't read Kant or Hegel.

145
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:41,614
- You have any interest in that stuff?
- Maybe I'll get around to reading them.

146
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:45,714
- You read any recent writers?
- Not really, no.

147
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:50,751
- Not interested in them?
- Most aren't that good or interesting.

148
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,233
They're not as interesting
as the Victorian writers...

149
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,566
of the late 19th century.

150
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,299
I always kind of envied your life
in a way.

151
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,841
My life has become so hectic.

152
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,503
Why? Because I was so detached
from the human race?

153
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,809
Is that one of the reasons
why you envy me?

154
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,008
This cloistered environment
with your books.

155
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,109
Believe me, it's nothing to envy.

156
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:20,023
Charles started this comic thing.

157
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,186
He was completely obsessed with comics
when we were kids...

158
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,890
and had absolutely no other
normal kid interest.

159
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,195
He wasn't interested in toys or games.

160
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,394
He didn't play sports.

161
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:35,202
He didn't do anything but read comics,
draw comics, think comics and talk them.

162
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,108
I like drawing, but I had other
drawing interests besides comics.

163
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,705
I liked to draw realistic scenes...

164
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,477
just pictures of buildings
and cars and stuff.

165
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,849
He wasn't interested in that at all.
It was only comics.

166
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,449
This is the earliest one that still
exists that I have. Charles drew this.

167
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,619
That's supposed to be me,
and that's him.

168
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,927
You made me feel absolutely worthless
if I wasn't drawing comics.

169
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,063
I don't think I would have done that.
I don't think I was as far gone as that.

170
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:10,302
Maybe I was just unconsciously
imitating the old man.

171
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:16,113
- What was he like?
- My father was an overbearing tyrant.

172
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,212
Yes, he was.

173
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:23,517
Maybe I was unconsciously imitating him
when I forced you to draw comic books.

174
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:29,754
There's still a kind of sibling rivalry
between me and Robert...

175
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:33,457
like there was when we were kids
and he was still living at home.

176
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:37,559
I think basically Robert and I
are still competing with each other.

177
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:41,572
It's like when I'm drawing comics,
I still think of Charles' approval...

178
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,507
whether or not he's going to like them.

179
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:48,307
Charles had everybody drawing comics
in the family.

180
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,678
‘‘The Animal Town Publishing Company.’’

181
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,683
That was a club we had...

182
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:56,517
where we sat around
and talked about comics.

183
00:15:56,588 --> 00:16:01,252
I was usually the president.
Robert was usually the vice president.

184
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,023
Carol was usually the secretary...

185
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:08,465
and Sandy was the treasurer
and Maxon was the supply boy.

186
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,334
And he still resents that.

187
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:18,638
He still resents the fact we imposed
the role of supply boy on him.

188
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,759
Max Crumb in room 310?

189
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,901
Maxon was the scapegoat in the family.

190
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,508
Of five kids, he was definitely
on the bottom of the heap.

191
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,314
Just to explain...

192
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:05,016
we had these meetings for this club
Charles put together called...

193
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,684
The Animal Town Comics Club.

194
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,921
Something to do with comics.

195
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:15,228
Everybody had their job, a secretary,
a president, a vice president.

196
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,564
I was supply boy.

197
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:23,735
I got it more heavy or direct than
Robert, but there was the whole thing.

198
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,768
It was like a crazy sibling thing
between me, Charles and Robert...

199
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,780
in this room upstairs...

200
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,112
and the world didn't know
what the fuck was going on.

201
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:36,951
It was like three primordial monkeys
working it out in the trees.

202
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:41,391
Me and Maxon slept in the same bed
until we were 16 or something.

203
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,021
Very intimate, close situation.

204
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,399
Charles was inspired
by the Disney movie...

205
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,940
where Robert Newton plays
Long John Silver.

206
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,841
After we saw it on TV in 1955...

207
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,244
we started playing pirates
like normal kids do.

208
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,874
We'd go out and pretend.

209
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,386
We made this ship
out of an old refrigerator carton.

210
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:12,254
Charles would walk around town
dressed up like Long John Silver.

211
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:15,316
He had this old coat of my mother's,
this long, green coat.

212
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,158
He made himself a three-cornered hat
out of some woman's hat.

213
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,326
He had a crutch, and he'd tie up his leg
and go around town that way.

214
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:26,167
I didn't realize how fixated Charles was
on ‘‘Treasure Island’’ till years later.

215
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:31,403
This thing dominated our play
and our fantasy for six or seven years.

216
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,468
We drew these comics...

217
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:37,606
about ‘‘Treasure Island, ’' and it became
this real Baroque, elaborate thing...

218
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:41,016
way beyond the original Disney film.

219
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,520
This is one of Charles'.

220
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,081
This is one of our two-man comics
in which he would draw...

221
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,822
some of the characters and I would
draw some and have them interact.

222
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:54,388
That was a great school
of cartooning for me...

223
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:58,698
having to come up
with clever retorts to him.

224
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,262
He was actually much cleverer
and funnier than I was.

225
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:07,244
It got tiresome, but you had to do it.
He was in charge.

226
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,076
I had this very definite,
bad problem about Charles.

227
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:15,246
I think a lot of it had to do
with my morbid sensitivity to the guy...

228
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,381
as well as his natural affinity
to get in there and profit off it.

229
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,653
Robert was somewhat of a middleman.

230
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,355
It had this way of restricting...

231
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:28,263
or causing this terrible
self-consciousness in me as a kid.

232
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:33,532
I was morbidly modest about my body.
Sex was completely removed.

233
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:37,871
When it came time for me to become
sexually aware when I was in puberty...

234
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:41,902
Sex was nowhere near in my life.
I had absolutely nothing to do with it.

235
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,314
Sex was so heavily repressed.
That's when the seizures started.

236
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:50,754
I had a seizure. And a seizure's like
a point where your behavior becomes...

237
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:54,553
I'd have to get into the whole sex trip,
which is an awful involved topic.

238
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:59,290
All I thought about when I was
in my late teens and early 20s was sex.

239
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:04,893
I masturbated about four or five times
a week. How frequently did you...

240
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,997
I don't masturbate anymore now that
my sexual desires are completely dead.

241
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,237
Like I told you,
I can't get an erection anymore.

242
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,744
My God!

243
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:19,907
I don't know whether it's one thing
or a combination of things.

244
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:24,081
Maybe a combination of the medication
and lack of external stimulation.

245
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:29,423
Maybe approaching old age
has something to do with it. Who knows?

246
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:33,328
You need some external stimulation
to keep up your interest.

247
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,767
Now that my sexual desires are gone,
I'm not sure I want them back again.

248
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,634
My earliest sexual memories?

249
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:49,574
I remember being like four years old
and getting erections.

250
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,049
I guess my aunt or my mother's sister...

251
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,645
Humping her legs and her shoes
like under the table.

252
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,816
I remember going in my mother's closet.
She had cowboy boots...

253
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,621
she wore when it rained...

254
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,288
and humping those in the closet.

255
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,060
And I remember singing while doing it.

256
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,658
<i>Jesus loves me, this I know</i>

257
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,933
<i>For the Bible tells me so</i>

258
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,541
I remember...

259
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,545
when I was about five or six
I was sexually attracted to Bugs Bunny.

260
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,582
I cut out this Bugs Bunny
off the cover of a comic book...

261
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,847
and carried it around with me
in my pocket...

262
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,150
and took it out
and looked at it periodically.

263
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,021
It got wrinkled from handling.

264
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:38,961
I asked my mother to iron it
to flatten it out.

265
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,933
She did, and I was deeply disappointed
because it got all brown and brittle...

266
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,231
and it crumbled apart.

267
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,795
What was it about Bugs Bunny
that you found exciting?

268
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:52,310
I had this sexual attraction
to cute cartoon characters.

269
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,846
You tell me!
I don't know.

270
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:02,342
That all changed when I turned 12,
and I became fixated on Sheena.

271
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:10,785
‘‘Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, ’'
a TV show around '55, '56.

272
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,892
I became totally obsessed with Sheena
and went to bed every night...

273
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,907
thinking about the things
I wanted to do with Sheena.

274
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,782
Robert was very hung up on sex
when he was a little kid...

275
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,978
even more so than I was.

276
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,352
- I was? You think so?
- Yeah.

277
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:43,520
You were more inhibited as a child
than I was, even sexually.

278
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:48,726
You were more afraid of women than I was
as a young person.

279
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,826
When I was in high school,
I had a few dates with girls.

280
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:56,033
When you were in high school,
you didn't have any dates with anybody.

281
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,269
You were actually
sort of good-Iooking.

282
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:02,541
I was a handsome, good-Iooking chap
when I was a teenager.

283
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:06,243
But there was just something
that was wrong with my personality.

284
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,252
The teachers hated him,
the kids hated him.

285
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,585
High school was an absolute nightmare.

286
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,788
I was the most unpopular kid
in the high school.

287
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,127
People were always picking on me
and beating me up.

288
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,326
And the girls wouldn't
have anything to do with me.

289
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,269
They treated me like I was
the scum of the earth.

290
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:31,071
In this strip, I'm talking all about
my problems with women...

291
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,601
starting with high school
where I learned a lot about women...

292
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,409
because there was this guy
named Skutch, this guy here...

293
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:41,680
who was like this mean bully...

294
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,017
but he was also very charming.

295
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,923
All the girls liked him.
He was the dreamboat...

296
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,086
but he was also a bully.

297
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:55,828
My brother Charles was one of the guys
he singled out for particular attention.

298
00:23:55,901 --> 00:24:01,168
He had this gang of flunkies
that hung around with him, with Skutch.

299
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,537
So I remember this scene...

300
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,840
where Skutch punches out my brother
in the hallway at school.

301
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:11,713
It was a very sad sight
for me to see.

302
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,980
Charles gave up trying to be popular
or have girlfriends...

303
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:19,353
after everybody saw he couldn't fight
back, that he was beat up by Skutch.

304
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,052
I've been living at home
since I graduated from high school.

305
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,790
I made a few feeble attempts
along the way.

306
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:30,767
You're no worse off than people that are
in the world and have to deal with it.

307
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:35,773
But you got to take into consideration
that I'm taking tranquilizers.

308
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:39,436
And that makes it a lot easier
than it would otherwise be...

309
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,776
by taking these tranquilizers
and antidepressants.

310
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:47,080
If it wasn't for them, I'd probably
go completely crazy living with Mother.

311
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,746
I have to walk on eggs
when I'm around her.

312
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,950
Yeah, you do.

313
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,459
You can't tell my mother
the absolute truth.

314
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,088
She's in a heavy state of denial
about a lot of things.

315
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,894
I don't think
we should be talking about this.

316
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,334
- Where's my kitty cats?
- About her mother, she's...

317
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:08,497
What the hell's going on?

318
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:13,738
She doesn't like you to talk about
her mother who was a complete monster.

319
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,337
- What?
- Fix that thing in the hallway.

320
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,905
- What thing?
- The window.

321
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,918
What's wrong with it?

322
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:25,685
- It's some film equipment or something.
- It's some kind of film equipment.

323
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,954
- Where are my kitty cats?
- I don't know.

324
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:33,760
Don't worry about it. It's all gonna be
out of here and back to normal.

325
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,566
Here it shows these girls talking about
how one of their friends...

326
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,576
got a date with Skutch
and how envious they all are.

327
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,738
This is how I felt about it.

328
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,646
I'm a little bitter about it,
as you can see.

329
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,082
I show here how I thought
that most teenage boys...

330
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,620
are very cruel and aggressive.

331
00:25:56,688 --> 00:26:00,886
And if girls could see that I was more
kind and sensitive, they would like me.

332
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,723
They were kind of impressed
by the fact I could draw.

333
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:08,129
I couldn't understand why they liked
these cruel, aggressive guys and not me.

334
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:11,999
I was more kind and sensitive,
more like them.

335
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,801
I didn't realize they didn't want you
to be like them, basically.

336
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,707
I felt very hurt
and cruelly misunderstood...

337
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,177
because I considered myself
talented and intelligent...

338
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,272
and yet I was not
very attractive physically.

339
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:28,046
I didn't think those things mattered.
It was what's inside that was important.

340
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:33,924
When I was 13 and 14 and trying to be
a normal teenager, I was really a jerk.

341
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,927
I tried to act
like I thought they were acting.

342
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:42,058
It came out all wrong and weird,
so then I stopped completely...

343
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,624
and became a shadow,
I wasn't even there.

344
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,934
People weren't aware that I was...

345
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,907
in the same world they were in.

346
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:54,468
That freed me completely because
I wasn't under pressures to be normal.

347
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,175
So I got interested in old-time music,
and went to the black section of town...

348
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,275
knocking on doors
and looking for old records...

349
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,617
and things like that
that would be unthinkable...

350
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,054
if you were going to be
a normal teenager.

351
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:10,561
Starting about 17, I started being
driven by that obsession that...

352
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:15,032
‘‘I'll go down in history as
a great artist. That'll be my revenge.’’

353
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,695
This is my image
celebrating Valentine's Day.

354
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,671
‘‘February 13, 1962.

355
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,141
I decided to reject conforming
when society rejected me.

356
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,008
I've heard all about
that 'be yourself' stuff.

357
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,741
When I'm myself,
people think I'm nuts.

358
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:34,876
Guess I'll have to be satisfied
with cats and old records.

359
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,683
Girls are just utterly
out of my reach.

360
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,247
They won't even let me draw them.’’

361
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,954
All that changed
after I got famous.

362
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,506
Absolutely, I would love
to pose for you.

363
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,010
Excellent.

364
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,741
Anytime you want to come by and visit,
that'd be really nice.

365
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:07,911
- Excellent.
- I always wanted to see you again.

366
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,498
Some of the early ‘‘Weirdo’’ collages...

367
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,194
and also some publications.

368
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,260
We managed to track them down.

369
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,308
I think Crumb...

370
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:08,106
is basically the Brueghel
of the last half of the 20th century.

371
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,774
There wasn't a Brueghel of the first
half, but there is of the last half.

372
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,977
And that is Robert Crumb...

373
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:18,819
because he gives you
that tremendous kind of impassion...

374
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,156
of lusting, suffering,
crazed humanity...

375
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:27,221
in all sorts of bizarre,
gargoyle-like allegorical forms.

376
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:30,734
He's got this very powerful imagination,
which goes over the top a lot...

377
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,736
but it very seldom lies.

378
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,396
He's Mr. Natural.

379
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:39,068
He accepts women
how they really are...

380
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,442
and makes them even more beautiful
than they really...

381
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:45,279
Like that woman.
I mean, she's really...

382
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,808
She's got energy, form and drive.

383
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,355
You can't push these women around.

384
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:55,153
They're not wimps.
He gives power to women.

385
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,423
He made it okay for me
to have a butt.

386
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:02,865
He did a drawing of me,
which I really liked a lot. It was neat.

387
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:07,098
It showed my thighs as they really are.
He helped me change my self-image.

388
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:10,972
I had felt so inadequate before.
It was like I didn't know...

389
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,772
Believe me, Stevayne,
you're adequate.

390
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,779
Oh, you're so adequate.

391
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,949
I feel Robert's work...

392
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:24,353
is one of the most pertinent
social portraits...

393
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,356
of an era...

394
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:30,087
touching issues related to politics...

395
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,619
to sex, to drugs, to religion...

396
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,234
to the fine arts.

397
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:41,830
And I would say Robert
is the Daumier of our time.

398
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,148
He's a very remarkable artist, indeed.

399
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,483
The tradition that I see him
belonging to is, essentially...

400
00:30:56,554 --> 00:31:01,287
the one of graphic art
as social protest, social criticism...

401
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,884
which, of course,
has extremely long roots.

402
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:07,659
There are elements of Goya in Crumb.
Goya's sense of monstrosity...

403
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:12,396
comes out in those menacing bird-headed
women of Crumb's for instance.

404
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,267
Robert! In front of all these people?

405
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,149
The undergrounds are alive and well.

406
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,092
Whole industry sprung up.
They're still reprinting the early ones.

407
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:41,723
Number two, number four.

408
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,530
God only knows how many of those
have been printed by now.

409
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,804
‘‘Puke and Explode. '’

410
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,571
It's called ‘‘Puke and Explode’’.

411
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:58,014
That's new. Who put that out?
I don't know about these kids today.

412
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,483
I guess you really started all this.
You created this whole thing.

413
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:04,077
You're responsible.

414
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,521
I don't like to take credit for that.

415
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,651
Some of this stuff,
I know nobody would.

416
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,397
I'm a really big fan of yours.

417
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:18,094
I'm wondering if there's any chance
I can get an autograph from you.

418
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:21,536
I don't think so.
I don't believe in giving autographs.

419
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,667
Okay, well thanks anyway.

420
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:34,013
- When are you actually moving?
- Couple months.

421
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,645
France isn't perfect or anything.

422
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:42,125
But it's slightly less evil
than the United States, I think.

423
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,286
But that's not why I'm moving.

424
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:47,456
Talk to my wife if you want to know
why I'm moving.

425
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,558
We do have something here
that we wanted to show you.

426
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:55,129
- Yeah?
- Yeah. 1967 rock concert poster.

427
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,140
Extremely rare item.

428
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:01,201
It’s my only rock concert poster
I ever did.

429
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,771
There's this legend I keep hearing.
People telling me...

430
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:09,013
‘‘Somebody told me you used to live with
the Grateful Dead in Haight Ashbury...

431
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:12,784
and you hung around with Jerry Garcia. '’

432
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:17,556
I never had anything to do
with those guys. I hated that music.

433
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,859
I went to a couple of those
rock concerts and just fell asleep.

434
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,457
Found it completely boring,
that psychedelic music.

435
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,797
I've got something for you.
I want to tell you a little secret.

436
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,240
It's called ‘‘Om Mani Padme Hum’’.

437
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:45,381
This is where I get recognized more than
anyplace in the world, on Haight Street.

438
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,983
- Amazing.
- I know. These are my people!

439
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,195
People come to me and say,
‘‘R. Crumb!’’

440
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,424
Sometimes some guy will sit with me...

441
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,990
and chew my ear off
about all his hopes and dreams.

442
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:01,004
Usually it's some broken-down
hippie-pest guy.

443
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:05,600
It's never like a beautiful young
20-year-old girl.

444
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,669
It's just so interesting
to come here and draw people.

445
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:12,841
That's the main reason I come here,
just to watch people.

446
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:20,118
That girl was sitting here one day.
Beautiful girl.

447
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,887
I drew this other girl.
She came up and wanted the drawing.

448
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,793
So I cut it out,
gave it to her.

449
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,058
- Good way to meet girls.
- Right.

450
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,965
I drew this girl.
She invited me to her house.

451
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,128
Unfortunately, she wasn't
very attractive.

452
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,104
You kept the picture, I see.

453
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:41,273
It's ironic that you're
so identified with the '60s.

454
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:46,214
At the time, it didn't seem you fit in
with that flower child thing.

455
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,751
I tried!

456
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:52,483
I used to come here every day
and try and be one of them.

457
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:56,926
My main motivation was,
get some of that free love action.

458
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,792
but I wasn't too good at it.

459
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,832
People would ask,
‘‘Are you a narc?’’

460
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,993
They would move away from you
at the love-in. I look like I do now.

461
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,232
Exactly. You, in effect...

462
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:12,242
- You did have a costume.
- It wasn't the right costume.

463
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,040
I remember Janis Joplin giving me
this piece of advice.

464
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,547
‘‘Crumb, what's the matter with you?
Don't you like girls?’’

465
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,845
I said, ‘‘Of course I like girls.
What do you think?’’

466
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:25,651
She said, ‘‘Just let your hair grow long,
get a satin, billowy shirt...

467
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,954
velvet jackets and bell bottoms
and platform shoes.

468
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:31,187
You'll do all right.’’

469
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,958
I just couldn't do that.

470
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:38,297
The whole thing was too silly to me.
I couldn't get with it.

471
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,630
Here's a real beautiful one.

472
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,303
I should get...

473
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,541
The work in this book,
the art, the feelings...

474
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,741
are what made me fall in love
with Robert.

475
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,183
The way he saw colors
and the way he saw women.

476
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:59,383
When I was 17 years old,
I looked a lot like that.

477
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,687
So I was what he had been drawing.

478
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:05,092
I was the embodiment of what
he had been drawing for years.

479
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,758
It's such a sweet,
romantic vision of things.

480
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,768
He did this book.
It took him, I think, a year.

481
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,031
That was his life.

482
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,006
He had just finished the book
days before we met.

483
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,440
My parents were always fighting
all the time.

484
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,478
I used to say,
‘‘I'm never getting married.’’

485
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:26,381
My father said, ‘‘You'll marry the first
one that comes along.’’ He was right.

486
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,784
Robert always had a sketchbook
or two going.

487
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,119
He was constantly drawing.

488
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,092
If we were in a restaurant,
he'd draw on the place mat.

489
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,685
If we were on the bus,
he'd draw on his bus ticket.

490
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:44,833
I had this big change
in 1965 and '66.

491
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:48,201
It was visionary.

492
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:51,036
Very powerful,
kind of knock-you-on-your-ass...

493
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:54,236
visionary experience.

494
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,975
This is my sketchbook for 1966
that covers that period.

495
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,348
I took this very weird drug.

496
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:05,617
Supposedly it was LSD,
but it had a really weird effect.

497
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,454
It made my brain all fuzzy.

498
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,687
This effect lasted
for a couple of months.

499
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:14,094
I started getting these images,
cartoon characters like this...

500
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:17,362
that I'd never drawn before
with these big shoes and everything.

501
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:22,338
I let go of trying to have any coherent,
fixed idea about what I was doing.

502
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:27,810
I started being able to draw these
stream-of-consciousness comic strips.

503
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:31,905
Just kind of making up stuff.
It didn't have to make any sense.

504
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,850
It could be stupid.
It didn't make any difference.

505
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,355
All the characters that I used
for the next several years...

506
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,118
came to me during this period.

507
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,626
These fit into this vision I was having.

508
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:49,189
It was a revelation of some seamy side
of America's subconscious.

509
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:53,135
When I was drawing this,
there was this young girl. She was 11.

510
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,138
She said, ‘‘Isn't that cute?’’

511
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:59,666
To me, it was like a horror show,
this whole thing.

512
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,440
And she thought it was really cute
and happy looking.

513
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:06,745
To me, it was like a drawing
of the horror of America.

514
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:55,923
There were these hippie underground
papers starting up in '66, '67.

515
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,934
Every town had one or two of them.

516
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,563
They would print anything if it was
related to the psychedelic experience...

517
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,698
or the hippie ethic.

518
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,969
So I started submitting...

519
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:09,342
these LSD-inspired comics
I had been doing...

520
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:11,404
to these papers,
and they liked them.

521
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:15,009
Then this guy came who suggested
I do a whole issue of his paper.

522
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:18,920
It was called ‘‘Yarrowstalks’’.
I did that, and that went over big.

523
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:23,221
He said, ‘‘Why don't you do psychedelic
comic books, and I'll publish them?’’

524
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:28,129
So I set to work, and I did
two whole issues of ‘‘Zap Comix’’.

525
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,671
Crumb was incredibly exciting
and incredibly hot.

526
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,038
There were just a handful of us...

527
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,844
doing this new form of comics.

528
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:57,684
And what he was doing
was just more innovative...

529
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:01,350
than what any of us
had even thought of.

530
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:07,289
It was fun to be a part of that
and to see ‘‘Zap’’ suddenly everywhere.

531
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:11,460
From this concept of Robert's, this
fantasy of doing his own comic book...

532
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:13,469
with a glossy cover
and actually printed...

533
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:17,633
to seeing it turning up in all the
windows on Haight Street, around town...

534
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,835
hearing people talk about it...

535
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:23,641
having the other artists show up
and wanting to be a part of it.

536
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:28,344
It happened very quickly. It seems to me
it happened in a matter of weeks.

537
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:56,178
Crumb gave the ownership of ‘‘Zap’’
to the artists. There was no editor.

538
00:41:56,247 --> 00:42:00,684
There was a certain point where
it seemed underground comics...

539
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:03,481
could get into the big time...

540
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:07,888
and Crumb always seemed reluctant
to push that sort of thing.

541
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:12,327
They were offering him 100,000 bucks...

542
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,626
just to start talking.

543
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,326
Robert turned it down
in two seconds.

544
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:20,859
Aline screamed in the background,
‘‘What are you doing? We need money.’’

545
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:24,339
Forget it! I'm not going on
‘‘Saturday Night Live’’.

546
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:27,309
The Rolling Stones wanted me to do
an album cover.

547
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,108
A couple other deals like that.
I said ‘‘No.’’

548
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,512
This is not something you see
every day in America...

549
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,574
where selling out
is everybody's ambition.

550
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:39,419
After about a year of recognition
and all the bullshit of fame...

551
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,958
I just said, ‘‘Fuck it’’...

552
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:45,792
and I started drawing the dark part
of myself again in the comics...

553
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,888
which I'd always kept hidden before.

554
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,366
I was used to what he had been doing...

555
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:54,063
which was really quite sweet.

556
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:56,231
Then he did this one that was...

557
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:59,970
just incredibly hostile to women...

558
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,376
very sexually hostile.

559
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:08,078
I wasn't expecting it.
I was really shocked and taken aback.

560
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,143
And just kind of like, whack!

561
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,053
It's hard for me to believe...

562
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:17,992
that he can't channel himself
into doing better work.

563
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:22,965
I like a lot of his work. And I don't
miss the satirical aspect of it.

564
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:26,594
Then I have a different reaction.

565
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,639
Perhaps one of being really
turned off and disgusted.

566
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:34,303
And you know this cartoon,
‘‘Joe Blow’’...

567
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:38,075
is one that I thought about a lot
in that light.

568
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:41,845
On the one hand,
it's a satire of a 1950s...

569
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,149
the healthy facade
of the American family.

570
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:48,419
It kind of exposes the sickness
under the surface.

571
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,494
But at the same time you sense...

572
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:56,329
that Crumb is getting off on it
himself in some other way.

573
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,565
On another level,
it's a self-indulgent orgy in a fantasy.

574
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,437
And the fantasy,
specifically, this story...

575
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:07,102
is a story about a father...

576
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,669
who commands his daughter
to give him a blow job.

577
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:13,046
She does,
and they wind up having sex.

578
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:17,178
And the little Leave-It-To-Beaver type
brother comes running in...

579
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,779
and sees the father and his sister,
and he's shocked.

580
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,791
He runs to the mother
to tell her.

581
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:27,126
And Mom comes out of a closet wearing
a sort of S&M getup.

582
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,995
And the little boy says, ‘‘Oh, cool.’’

583
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,467
The next thing,
Mom and son are having sex.

584
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:35,664
The whole cartoon ends
with the parents saying...

585
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:39,539
‘‘Gee, we should spend more time
with the kids. '’ Very funny.

586
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:44,377
So you read something like this...

587
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,576
and I think that it has
gone over the line...

588
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:52,247
from satire of a 1950s...

589
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:56,656
hygienic family in denial...

590
00:44:56,727 --> 00:45:01,096
into something which
is just Crumb producing pornography.

591
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:04,362
I think this theme in his work
is omnipresent.

592
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,666
It's part of an arrested
juvenile vision.

593
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:12,732
Crumb's material comes out of a deep
sense of the absurdity of human life.

594
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:17,110
At a certain psychic level, there aren't
any heroes, villains or heroines.

595
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,513
Even the victims are comic.

596
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,688
It's this which people in America
find rather hard to take...

597
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,986
because it conflicts
with their basic feelings.

598
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:32,495
That sort of mixture of utopianism on
one hand and Puritanism on the other...

599
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,031
which is only another kind
of utopianism...

600
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:40,298
which has given us the kind
of messy discourse that we have today.

601
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:43,999
So Crumb, like all great satirists,
is an outsider in his own country.

602
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:07,603
Jesus! The fucking
raging epithet music...

603
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:12,274
coming out of every car, every store,
every person's head.

604
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,778
If they don't have noisy radios,
they got earphones on like...

605
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,653
‘‘Motherfuckin' cock suckin'
son of a bitch.’’

606
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:26,219
That's a lot of aggression.
A lot of anger, a lot of rage.

607
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,265
Everybody's walking advertisements.

608
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:32,598
They've got advertisements
on their clothes.

609
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:36,161
Go walking around with ‘‘Adidas’’
written across their chests...

610
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,332
or ‘‘49ers’’ on their hats.

611
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:41,605
Jesus. It's pathetic.
It's pitiful.

612
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:44,203
The whole culture's one unified field...

613
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,876
of bought, sold,
market-researched everything.

614
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:50,715
It used to be people fermented
their own culture.

615
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:54,621
It took hundreds of years,
and it evolved over time.

616
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:57,922
That's gone in America.

617
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:02,364
People now don't even have
any concept that there ever was...

618
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:05,731
a culture outside of this thing
that's created to make money.

619
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:09,329
Whatever's the biggest, latest thing,
they're into it.

620
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,898
You just get disgusted after a while
with humanity...

621
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,342
for not having more,
kind of like...

622
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:21,214
intellectual curiosity about
what's behind all this jive bullshit.

623
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,264
Charles and I talk
quite a bit about things.

624
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,831
- We don't talk that much.
- Yeah, we do.

625
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,639
We hold aloof from each other
for the most part.

626
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,374
You spend all your time
watching television...

627
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:54,417
and doing your crossword puzzles.

628
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:59,683
I don't watch television. I turn it on
because it puts me to sleep.

629
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,591
It's a good way to get to sleep.

630
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:07,459
We're two recluses
living in the same house.

631
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,499
I wake up at 3:00 a.m.
and it's still on.

632
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,002
You do most of the talking
in the relationship, Mother.

633
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,061
There's no doubt about that.

634
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:20,075
You told me that even though you take
medication, you still feel depressed.

635
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:25,308
Yeah, but not as much as I would
if I wasn't taking the medication.

636
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:28,476
What would happen
if you stopped taking that stuff?

637
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:31,385
I don't know.
I tried it a couple of times...

638
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,253
and I didn't like what was starting
to happen to me.

639
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:38,784
- He gets insomnia.
- I felt I was becoming unhinged.

640
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,956
So I got back on them in a big hurry.

641
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,291
I tried this a couple of times,
about two or three times.

642
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,860
Do you still think
they're picking my brain, Mother?

643
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,372
Yeah.

644
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,744
You have nothing to hide,
nothing to be ashamed of.

645
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,976
He's a good person.

646
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:05,454
People like Charles.
You know.

647
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,389
Some people like me
and some don't.

648
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,261
I'm a very quiet,
well-behaved citizen.

649
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:16,197
- I've gone from one extreme to another.
- You've gone in a complete circle.

650
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,200
You used to make trouble
on the streets.

651
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:21,294
One of the last times I went out
with you, we were walking around...

652
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:24,704
and you went up to some old lady
on the street...

653
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:27,709
and started drilling her
about her spiritual life...

654
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:31,269
and she got frightened
and threatened to call the police.

655
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:36,081
Charles goes up to these strangers
on the streets, starts raving at them.

656
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,144
He was just a kid having fun.

657
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:42,555
- This was when he was about 30.
- No, he wasn't!

658
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,094
He's still doing that kind of stuff.

659
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:49,724
Now he doesn't leave the house.
He got in trouble whenever he went out.

660
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:53,758
Will you give me one good reason
for leaving the house?

661
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:58,035
At least he's not out
taking illegal drugs.

662
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:01,100
- No, he's taking legal drugs.
- I'm taking legal dope.

663
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,238
Or being married and making
some woman miserable.

664
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,248
This is true.

665
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:10,446
One thing that kind of...
I spent all this money.

666
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,116
And he's got these $200 teeth upstairs
and he won't wear them.

667
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,355
- They're too uncomfortable.
- At first.

668
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:21,955
You gotta leave them in there.
Then you don't know they're there.

669
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,500
I never go anywhere, see anybody.

670
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:27,503
What does he need them for?
To chew food or what?

671
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:29,505
Pride in his own appearance.

672
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,201
He never goes out.
What does he care what he looks like?

673
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:35,301
I take a bath about once
in six weeks.

674
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,779
I believe in having
a certain pride in yourself.

675
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:43,876
In a way not that your ego gets out
of hand and you're an egomaniac...

676
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:47,446
Pride can't exist
except in relation to other people.

677
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:49,617
Yeah. That's right.

678
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:57,299
I don't know. Your hygiene habits
are pretty good.

679
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:04,502
I'm never constipated.
That's about all I can say for myself.

680
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:15,484
That's something. You don't have
hemorrhoids? Then you're doing good.

681
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:19,147
Your father used to have trouble
that way, with constipation.

682
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:22,623
He was constipated all the time.

683
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:25,661
- You were really obsessed with...
- I could say something, but I won't.

684
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:29,256
You always gave us kids castor oil.
You were obsessed with constipation.

685
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:34,235
When all you kids were real little,
I had to take care of you by myself.

686
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:38,673
That period where you used to try
giving us all enemas? That didn't work.

687
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:42,303
- I never gave you enemas.
- Somebody...

688
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:45,906
You always threatened to give us enemas
if we didn't behave properly.

689
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:49,884
- I did not!
- Somebody tried to give me an enema.

690
00:54:55,959 --> 00:55:00,328
- She wouldn't admit it, but...
- That it's not a regular suburban house?

691
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,661
It's a suburban house...

692
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,758
that looks like ‘‘Whatever Happened
to Baby Jane’’ or something.

693
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:08,235
She has weird trinkets around?

694
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,739
She has cats.
The whole place smells like pee.

695
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,072
Don't say that on the film.

696
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,840
She doesn't want people in the house.

697
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:22,613
The next thing my mother knows,
this whole crew is filing in the door.

698
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:26,281
‘‘Oh, no pictures!
No way, Jose’’ she says.

699
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:32,019
Terry says, ‘‘No, we're going upstairs.
We're gonna do it in Charles' room.’’

700
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:36,031
Of course then she got into it, and
after a while, you couldn't shut her up.

701
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,033
She talked on.

702
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,626
She chattered on and on.
It was awful.

703
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:45,437
- What year is this? 1970.
- I'd just met you.

704
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,170
This is when I first met you
in 1969.

705
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,371
That's me. I remember that.

706
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:54,645
- This doesn’t look like me.
- You're right. Let me touch it up.

707
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:58,347
The nose is too bulbous.

708
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:01,447
The eyes are too far apart also.

709
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:05,392
It's too late now, really.
This was 18 years ago.

710
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:08,363
- God, it just...
- How about this drawing of you?

711
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,195
I remember we were in this restaurant.

712
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,292
This is ridiculous. Oh, good.

713
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,237
- I'm still rolling.
- She almost fell off the roof.

714
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:19,571
But she can't see the notebook.
That's me?

715
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:22,543
That's you with your hair dryer.

716
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:24,971
There's Terry.

717
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:31,383
That's me.
I like that drawing.

718
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:34,946
That's one of the few drawings I liked.

719
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:38,425
So you're going to sell these books
and I don't get a percentage?

720
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:41,293
This whole case of sketchbooks...

721
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,662
I'm giving to this guy
for a house in France.

722
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,463
I had a lot of drawings here.
What do I get out of this?

723
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:49,403
- What drawings?
- Several. I drew that!

724
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:52,600
- No, Aline drew those.
- You sure?

725
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,870
- I drew that.
- No, Aline drew those.

726
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,377
Really?

727
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,844
That's Aline when I first knew her.

728
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,181
You went from this page,
where I was on it...

729
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,347
and like two pages later, it's Aline?

730
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,983
- How did that happen?
- It was a crazy period.

731
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,788
That's disgusting.

732
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:16,463
- That's horrible.
- That's you and that's Aline.

733
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,125
Oh, Jesus.

734
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:22,934
You really hated women then.
Do you think it's improved since?

735
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,497
Yeah. I hate them
a little bit less now.

736
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:38,513
Guys like me, I like certain kinds
of women's legs.

737
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,749
- I'm not masochistic.
- But you don't like feet!

738
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:45,124
- You're not heavily into feet.
- I'm not fixated, but I can get into it.

739
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:50,360
I can have an orgasm playing
with someone's foot.

740
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:55,727
It's not a real narrow fixation.

741
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:03,404
It's that the way the mind of the person
who’s interested in legs and feet...

742
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,210
is very different from the mind of
the person who's interested in breasts.

743
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:09,376
Breast men tend to be aggressive,
outgoing, athletic.

744
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:13,047
- People who like the lower body...
- She's got these types categorized.

745
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:17,616
People who like the lower body
tend to be frightened, introverted.

746
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:22,324
It all has to do with being down on the
floor when you were a scared child...

747
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:26,391
and looking up at
that big tower of Mommy.

748
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:30,371
What's down there? The feet and legs.
That's where the security is.

749
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,432
Women go around feeling victimized
by men all the time.

750
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,740
They feel like the men
have the power...

751
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:39,213
and the area where women can take
the power from men is through sex.

752
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:44,777
Men have that fetishistic twist to their
minds because they have that ability...

753
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:48,085
to concentrate on one thing
to the exclusion of all else...

754
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:51,684
and can really be manipulated sexually,
where women are not as susceptible.

755
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,628
You are so frightening. Jesus!

756
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:58,929
Women are susceptible to power.
That's what I find.

757
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:02,961
Any display of power and,
‘‘Oh, he's so interesting!

758
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:08,102
Who's that man who's being so obnoxious
and arrogant? He's so interesting.’’

759
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:11,704
I'm a career pornographer.
I've been at it for 16 years.

760
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:16,514
It was what I was always destined for.
I always loved pornography.

761
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:20,888
<i>I took my birthday money</i>
<i>when I turned 18 because I was legal...</i>

762
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:23,983
<i>and went to the adult bookstore</i>
<i>and bought pornography.</i>

763
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:28,258
<i>I went through some other jobs, </i>
<i>but always sexualized them...</i>

764
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:31,357
<i>so finding pornography</i>
<i>was just right. </i>

765
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:36,394
<i>I'm the editor of ‘‘Jugs’’, ‘‘Leg Show’’</i>
<i>and ‘‘Bust Out’’ right now.</i>

766
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:40,772
<i>I was also the creator</i>
<i>of ‘‘Big Butt’’ magazine.</i>

767
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:43,334
We've arranged with Robert</i>
<i>to do a photo shoot today...</i>

768
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,938
<i>which will appear</i>
<i>in ‘‘Leg Show’’ magazine.</i>

769
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:49,815
We’re going to have four or five women</i>
<i>who we think Robert will like...</i>

770
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:52,377
<i>but there's never any telling</i>
<i>with Robert Crumb.</i>

771
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:54,980
Here's a girl I wish I could've gotten
for the Crumb shoot.

772
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:58,926
This is a mother-daughter
dominance team from L.A.

773
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:03,295
‘‘Mother taught me to smother,’’
is this girl's motto.

774
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:05,357
We're doing this
for the Christmas issue.

775
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:09,735
The mother's wearing a red outfit.
We wanted them to do something festive.

776
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:35,181
He's a person that would rather be a
brain in a jar that a person in a body.

777
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:38,819
Basically, we both focus
on my body sexually.

778
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:44,999
Robert's not too oriented
towards normal sex.

779
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:48,094
There wasn't much in the way
of normal sex in our relationship...

780
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:53,302
but lots of piggyback rides
and wrestling around.

781
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,810
He liked to sit on my shoe a lot.

782
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,005
He never takes his shirt off.

783
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,982
He likes to not exist.

784
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,679
Robert is an admitted
compulsive masturbator.

785
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:07,382
He masturbates four or five times a day.

786
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:11,484
He told me he masturbates
to his own comics.

787
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,586
I'm sure Picasso did.

788
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:19,896
I think probably, yeah, some do.

789
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:24,129
But I don't think many artists...

790
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:28,200
give you such a wide range
of masturbatory possibility as Crumb.

791
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:31,906
That is, if you like
what he likes.

792
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,573
Does he do that?

793
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:36,413
Robert doesn't exaggerate anything
in his comics.

794
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,920
The woman are exactly the way
he wants them...

795
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:42,151
and he accurately portrays himself...

796
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:47,492
as the skinny, bad posture,
myopic man he is.

797
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:51,055
Some people wonder if he doesn’t
exaggerate the size of his penis...

798
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:53,534
which appears awfully big in the comics.

799
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,128
Robert does not exaggerate anything.

800
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:59,538
He is endowed with one
of the biggest penises in the world.

801
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:06,046
Why do I have my particular
sexual proclivities?

802
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,673
I don't know.

803
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,082
Ask a psychiatrist.
I don't know what it's about.

804
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:14,590
I always thought Robert
was just kidding about them.

805
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:16,625
You thought I was kidding?

806
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:21,455
That he was trying to be funny.

807
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,499
Yeah, that's right.

808
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:28,834
I couldn't imagine how anyone
could be serious about these things.

809
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:33,069
It was complete chaos,
this relationship.

810
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:36,771
The crying and fighting
started soon, actually.

811
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:39,781
You cried the third time
I'd been with you.

812
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:44,286
What's so horrible about crying?
Why is that painful to you?

813
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:49,154
‘‘Oh, my God! How can I deal with it?
What should I do? She's crying.’’

814
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:53,821
So you're saying that 20 years later
you still have no idea...

815
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:57,059
what you were doing
that could've contributed to that?

816
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:59,158
No, I guess I don't.

817
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:03,467
It was confusing because
he was totally irresponsible.

818
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:08,476
He would call and say, ‘‘I love you,
miss you, can't wait to see you.’’

819
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:11,672
He was supposed to be 200 miles away.

820
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:15,012
He'd say, ‘‘I'll see you
in a week or two.’’

821
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:19,953
I'd go out to buy groceries two hours
later and see him with another woman.

822
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:23,480
Then he'd wonder why I kicked him
or got mad.

823
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,754
Do you think I'm sadistic?

824
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:36,061
He would always act
like he was passively a victim.

825
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:39,904
I used to call it his
‘‘Ashley Wilkes’’ routine...

826
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:42,376
that he would pull...

827
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:46,848
where he was just this
passive victim of circumstance...

828
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:49,009
in other people's desires.

829
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:53,681
When really he was just trying
to get away with whatever he could...

830
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:55,690
and walking all over people.

831
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:59,194
I walked all over people?
Like who? You?

832
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:03,562
You think you were a good guy,
a nice boyfriend to me at the time.

833
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:09,261
I think I'm not a very romantic person,
that's all.

834
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:14,708
I don't think I've ever actually
been in love.

835
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:19,111
I have many letters where you said
‘‘I love you’’ hundreds of times.

836
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:23,481
I was abusing the word.
I had this overpowering...

837
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:25,383
I'm leaving.

838
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:28,446
I was very fond of you. Ouch!

839
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:30,549
I was fond of you...

840
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:35,063
and had this overpowering lust for you
that you could possibly imagine.

841
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:39,659
But I wouldn't say I was in love.
I just don't have it in me.

842
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:43,000
- I've never been in love or jealous.
- That's horrible.

843
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:47,202
The only woman I've ever been in love
with is Sophie, my darling daughter.

844
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,439
You made me mess up.

845
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:19,299
I did books in the '70s
that were self-deprecating.

846
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,468
My self-hatred was really intense then.

847
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:24,479
Did you ever see this one?
‘‘Twisted Sisters. ’’

848
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:29,776
Nice cover.
I show myself on the toilet.

849
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:32,116
It got no recognition.
Nobody bought it.

850
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,122
I asked the publisher how it was doing.

851
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:38,820
He said he was using it for insulation
in the walls of his barn.

852
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:43,430
What is the gist of your comics?
What are they like?

853
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,023
About me.

854
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:47,467
My sex life, my phobias...

855
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:49,970
what a disgusting human being
I think I am.

856
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:54,372
Your mother's featured in it
a lot, too.

857
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:57,708
It's the way I can tolerate my mother,
is by drawing...

858
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,374
really hideous drawings of her.

859
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,883
Like this, for example.

860
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:05,216
After Sophie was born,
my mother visited me.

861
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:08,120
She was so irritating and so unhelpful.

862
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:11,887
It talks about how she couldn't hold the
baby 'cause she'd had her nails wrapped.

863
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:15,988
My mother yells in the restaurant,
‘‘Got any Sweet N' Low, dear?’’

864
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,332
A quiet fern-bar restaurant
in San Francisco...

865
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,894
and every person
turned around to look.

866
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:27,534
She came to the airport in an Afro,
dressed up in this trendy outfit.

867
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:30,443
Robert and I looked like immigrants
just off the boat.

868
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:33,607
- Is your father on the bottom there?
- That's my mother's husband.

869
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:35,946
She had him dressed in a leisure suit.

870
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:39,317
When she first met him,
he wore baggy brown suits...

871
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:42,016
he had short hair and he was fat.

872
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:45,151
She put him on a diet,
and put him in safari outfits...

873
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,388
and made him grow sideburns.

874
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:51,422
But he was still ‘‘shlubby’’.
He had ‘‘shlubby’’ posture.

875
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,025
But he was ‘‘trendily’’ dressed.

876
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,571
Kind of follows along after her
like that.

877
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:59,369
- What does she think about your comics?
- She doesn't see them.

878
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:02,900
- She's not interested.
- She doesn't know you're a cartoonist?

879
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:07,847
Unconsciously she must know there's
things she doesn't want to know about.

880
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:12,217
And she doesn't take in very much
about anybody anyway.

881
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:13,949
She's not too interested.

882
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:18,756
She saw this painting and a bunch
of other paintings, and she said...

883
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:21,092
‘‘Those are nice. Who did them?’’
I said, ‘‘I did.’’

884
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:23,654
She said, ‘‘I didn't know you painted.’’

885
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:27,329
I mean, she sent me to art school!

886
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:30,201
You just change the subject.
‘‘What are we having for dinner?’’

887
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:40,348
One thing you've learned is
the importance of black. That's good.

888
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,577
Thanks, Pop.

889
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:48,346
Okay, enough.

890
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:52,989
Why did you choose this figure
in particular?

891
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:56,293
I like these photos.
They're powerful for some reason.

892
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:58,458
This one was easy to draw.

893
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:03,335
Finally picked attractive ones.
Some of them are ugly, you know.

894
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:06,499
- She's a mess.
- Yeah, she is.

895
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:09,806
The text talks about her being
an alcoholic reprobate.

896
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:11,813
They picked her up off the street.

897
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:14,645
This one. Oh, God!
Looks like a monster.

898
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:20,313
In my drawing of her,
I made her cuter than she really is...

899
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:23,950
because I acquired the cuteness curse
when I worked at American Greetings...

900
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:26,187
which I can't shake.

901
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:29,197
You got the tilt of her head right.

902
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:31,324
That's hard to do.

903
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,063
You have to really...
The proportions of this to this.

904
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:37,970
Is it the same or shorter?

905
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,406
I did a lot of erasing at first.

906
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:48,712
You haven't learned how to cheat yet
to get the desired effect you want.

907
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:51,685
Like what? Draw over the top of a Xerox?

908
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:57,124
You want to capture a certain thing
about this woman's face.

909
01:09:57,193 --> 01:10:00,458
- A certain defiance you see in there.
- Yeah, I didn't get it.

910
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:03,862
Exaggerate those little things
that give her that look.

911
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:08,632
Like the way her teeth slightly show.
She's got a slight sneer.

912
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,968
I try to do that,
but it's hard with pencil.

913
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,271
Just exaggerate, cheat a little.
Like the tilt of the head...

914
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:19,144
and the sneer, you would emphasize that.

915
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,207
You have to consciously
make a decision...

916
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:24,548
of what you want to bring out
in the face.

917
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,418
I did that here,
but it still didn't work out.

918
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,652
It's very subtle in that photo.
It's very subtle.

919
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:33,422
My drawing doesn't capture the hate.

920
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:37,158
It does in a way. You've got that
open mouth. That's the key to the thing.

921
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,997
- That sneer, you know?
- Baring the teeth.

922
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,900
Yeah. That's key.

923
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:46,533
They obviously ordered her to sit down
and don't move.

924
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:50,375
They're going to take her picture,
and just sit there.

925
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:53,279
You can see she doesn't like it.

926
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:57,217
It'd be good if you could take
life drawing.

927
01:10:57,286 --> 01:11:00,414
You didn't go to art school,
and look, you're rich and famous.

928
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:06,691
We're not talking about rich and famous.
We’re talking about learning to draw.

929
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:10,061
A lot of my recent works
appear in this ‘‘Weirdo’’ magazine.

930
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:14,933
These are the kind of guys who read my
work. It's an ode to the weirdo reader.

931
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:19,873
The hurt, sensitive guy who doesn't
fit in with the normal people.

932
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,534
Like these people.

933
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,977
She's saying, ‘‘I always hated
the Three Stooges.’’

934
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,277
Of course, he loves the Three Stooges.

935
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:32,145
This is my source material.

936
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:36,282
I couldn't find pictures in magazines
of ordinary, modern...

937
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,553
street scenes in America.

938
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:42,654
So I persuaded this guy in Sacramento
to spend a day with me driving around...

939
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:45,962
'cause I don't drive
and couldn't do it myself.

940
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:50,267
Just to take snapshots of ordinary
street corners in modern America.

941
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,739
This has been indispensable to me.

942
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:57,177
You can't remember these things, to draw
these modern light poles and crap.

943
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:01,148
All this junk
on every suburban street.

944
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:03,650
I've used it in a lot of places.

945
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:08,786
It's background here.
Stuff like that.

946
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:11,553
In my story here, I used it also.

947
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:18,499
This whole background, this stuff,
I put it over here.

948
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:21,900
You can't make up this crap.
It's too complicated.

949
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:26,339
On this cover I used a bunch of photos
to take that stuff.

950
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:30,105
In the real world, this stuff is not
created to be visually pleasing.

951
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:33,205
It's just accumulation
of the modern industrial world.

952
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:36,615
People don't even notice.
They block it out.

953
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:48,457
Robert and Sophie, dinner's ready.
Hurry up.

954
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:52,992
Go sit down. Get out of here.

955
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,002
- Who, me?
- No, her.

956
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,300
She's helping me.

957
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:00,001
Now she's break-dancing.
Get out of here.

958
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:07,313
Come over here and get your plate.

959
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:09,950
How's that?

960
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,952
I'll trade you the gum for the plate.

961
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:24,291
Gotta have my starch and my fat.

962
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:30,067
Look at all this food.

963
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,937
<i>It's fun to eat supper with your family.</i>
 
964
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:36,273
<i>Especially where there is good food</i>
<i>on the table.</i>

965
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,836
<i>At least you could manage</i>
<i>to be on time.</i>

966
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:42,281
<i>Your mother goes to all the trouble</i>
<i>to prepare a fine meal.</i>

967
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:45,149
<i>- It's only common courtesy, Chuck.</i>
<i>- I know.</i>

968
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,654
<i>But I couldn't help it.</i>
<i>I was late home from school.</i>

969
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:51,181
Once I reached adolescence, it was
the late '50s. Everybody I knew...

970
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,787
their families had nothing to do
with the advertisement for itself...

971
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:58,060
that the culture was presenting
on the TV screen.

972
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:01,466
<i>- Why not? </i>
<i>- Do I have to have a reason? </i>

973
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:04,665
<i>- All your friends will be there.</i>
<i>- I don't care.</i>
974
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,504
<i>Chuck! Don't talk</i>
<i>with your mouth full.</i>

975
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:13,141
<i>Chew your food well.</i>
<i>Chew and chew.</i>

976
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:15,809
<i>Doesn't it taste extra good that way?</i>

977
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,610
The whole thing is a big false front...

978
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:24,648
that was suffocating,
and so dreary and depressing.

979
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:27,661
They grew up in the depression.
I understand. They went through the war.

980
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:31,893
They wanted this thing that was
so tight, unthreatening and flat.

981
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:35,027
They wanted a dull lifestyle.
They wanted Perry Como.

982
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:39,631
They wanted this Ozzie and Harriet shell
we grew up in. The whole thing had...

983
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:44,839
this creepy, nightmarish,
grotesque quality.

984
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:55,484
This is the first issue of ‘‘Zap Comix’’
that I did in late 1967.

985
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:59,618
It was the beginning of all this
underground comic nonsense.

986
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:03,831
It was all very LSD inspired.

987
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:08,029
A lot of these are things
I redrew from sketchbooks.

988
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:11,539
This ‘‘Whiteman’’ character.
A lot of this stuff...

989
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:16,044
I didn't realize when I was doing it
what it was about or connected to.

990
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:19,603
I realized afterwards,
this is really about my father.

991
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:23,014
This rigid...

992
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,883
gung-ho American kind of guy.

993
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:30,084
A typical World War II generation man.

994
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:36,855
When my father died in '82, my aunt
gave me stuff my father had sent her.

995
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:41,062
One of the things was this book
he wrote, ‘‘Training People Effectively’’.

996
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:44,162
I'm not sure what he did for a living
in the last years of his life.

997
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:49,040
It had something to do with
employee motivation for a corporation.

998
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:51,045
Here's a photo.

999
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:56,545
I was reading about this syndrome in
Japan that Japanese businessmen have.

1000
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,587
Something about some smiling disease...

1001
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:04,149
where they have a fixed smile
on their face all the time.

1002
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,160
I think my father had that.

1003
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,560
The article said it was a sign
of deep depression.

1004
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,894
He didn't smile when he was home.

1005
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:13,958
The smile dropped
as soon as he came home.

1006
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:17,164
He was a grim guy.
He fought in the war and everything.

1007
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:20,003
He had a hard-ass attitude about life...

1008
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:24,603
and thought my mother was mollycoddling
all of us, which she was.

1009
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:29,549
All three of his sons ended up being
wimpy, nerdy weirdos.

1010
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:33,315
It broke his heart, I think.
He wanted one of us to become a Marine.

1011
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:38,721
My father was hotheaded.
He'd just blow his stack.

1012
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:42,457
He'd lash out and hit you real hard.

1013
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:46,524
When I was five years old, on
Christmas this whole thing happened...

1014
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:50,538
where he blew his stack at me
and busted my collarbone.

1015
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,540
- When you were five?
- Yeah.

1016
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,834
Charles had a penchant
for getting in trouble.

1017
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:59,380
He was diabolical as a kid.

1018
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,611
And my father would beat him
unmercifully...

1019
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:05,744
for these things he was doing,
crimes he was committing.

1020
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:07,982
It just made him worse.

1021
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:10,820
I had this subconscious desire
to be punished.

1022
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:14,123
- Why?
- It had something to do with my father.

1023
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:18,394
It had something to do with
being brought up by a sadistic bully.

1024
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:22,601
There's some connection there
between the two of them...

1025
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:26,004
although I'm not really sure what it is.

1026
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,433
What was your mom like
when you were a kid?

1027
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:34,847
She was an amphetamine addict. The
amphetamines would make her act crazy...

1028
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:37,544
and do and say really crazy things.

1029
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:41,885
It had an absolutely devastating effect,
I think, on all five of us kids.

1030
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:43,390
Do you?

1031
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:47,423
It had a devastating effect on me,
anyway.

1032
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,589
How did your parents get along?

1033
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:52,327
They got along well up until the time
I was 9 or 10 years old.

1034
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:56,838
But after Beatie started taking
amphetamines to keep her weight down...

1035
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:58,839
they had a terrible time.

1036
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:02,070
They were screaming and yelling
at each other all the time...

1037
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:04,635
morning, noon and night.

1038
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:09,207
- She'd scratch at the old man's face.
- Till it looked like ground hamburger.

1039
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,684
He would put makeup on
when he went to work...

1040
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:15,712
in an attempt to cover up
the scratches on his face.

1041
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,850
The old man came to me
and said...

1042
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:22,090
‘‘lf you don't go out and get a job,
I’II make your life a hell on earth.’’

1043
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:28,962
That's exactly what he started to do,
to make my life a hell on earth.

1044
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:33,133
So to get him off my back, I took a job
as a telephone solicitor...

1045
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,142
for the ‘‘Philadelphia Inquirer’’.

1046
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:38,613
I stuck it out for a year...

1047
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:42,377
because I was afraid of what
he would do to me if I didn't.

1048
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:44,749
That's the last time you held a job,
though, right?

1049
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:49,416
And it only lasted for a year.
That was back in '69.

1050
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:53,120
The old man was always trying
to make productive citizens out of us.

1051
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:56,528
When I was a teenager, he forced me
to use my drawing talent...

1052
01:18:56,598 --> 01:19:01,194
to draw pictures of houses, then ask
the people if they wanted to buy them.

1053
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:06,571
- That was the old man's idea, wasn't it?
- Completely his idea. He made me do it.

1054
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,575
It was a hateful job.

1055
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:13,312
When I first got well-known,
he was proud of me.

1056
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:17,715
He heard I was getting well-known
for my work, but he never saw it.

1057
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:19,947
I don't think he would've approved.

1058
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:23,923
He would've disapproved of it
on so-called ‘‘moral grounds’’.

1059
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:26,961
Somebody told me that someone at work
showed him one of my comics...

1060
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,792
and that's when
he stopped talking to me.

1061
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:34,199
He wouldn't speak to me after he saw
the stuff I was doing in the early '70s.

1062
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:43,668
The story I had most trouble with
is this one.

1063
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:48,182
I got two pages into it and thought...

1064
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:52,118
‘‘This is too negative, too twisted,
too upsetting. I’ve gotta stop this.’’

1065
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:56,954
I quit working on it.
I threw the page in the garbage can.

1066
01:19:57,025 --> 01:20:00,256
At some point, Aline came
into my studio for something...

1067
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:04,094
and I decided, ‘‘I'll show her this
and see what she thinks about it.’’

1068
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,361
So I pulled it out of the garbage can.

1069
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:10,734
I said, ‘‘What do you think about this?

1070
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,297
I threw it away.
I didn't want to continue it.

1071
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:15,809
It's too weird, too disturbing.’’

1072
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:19,745
She read it and said,
‘‘You have to finish this.

1073
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,613
You've got to see this through.’’

1074
01:20:22,684 --> 01:20:27,621
I said, ‘‘She's a woman. She said I have
to do it, so I'll do it.’’

1075
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:31,386
So Flakey Foont answers the door and
there's a girl's body standing there.

1076
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:36,089
But what you see is Mr. Natural's head
and beard where her head should be.

1077
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:40,863
That's how it starts.
Flakey Foont is confused by that.

1078
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:45,999
And Mr. Natural comes galloping in...

1079
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:48,133
riding the girl around the room.

1080
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:51,611
Her body's very frisky,
and you don't see her head at all.

1081
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,116
You just see Mr. Natural's beard
where her head should be.

1082
01:20:56,952 --> 01:21:00,479
Then she lands in a split.

1083
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:05,959
And Mr. Natural starts talking about
what an amazing body this woman has.

1084
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:08,222
But the head was always a problem...

1085
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:10,992
'cause she had
such an obnoxious personality.

1086
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:15,901
Flakey Foont is shocked and horrified
when he sees she doesn't have a head.

1087
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:22,905
Mr. Natural explains, ‘‘She was
obnoxious, so I got rid of the head.

1088
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:25,344
You wanted her, lusted after her.

1089
01:21:25,413 --> 01:21:27,404
Now you can have her
because her head's missing.’’

1090
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:30,144
Then he explains
how he took the head off...

1091
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:33,619
and topped the neck with a cap.

1092
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:38,648
Then Mr. Natural says he discovered...

1093
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,662
that she had a second,
smaller brain in her butt...

1094
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:45,625
and that is what's
making the body function.

1095
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:49,636
Then he gives Foont directions on how
to feed her. You take the cap off...

1096
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:51,763
and put this funnel down her neck.

1097
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,809
Mr. Natural pulls out
this mannequin head and says...

1098
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:57,037
‘‘lf you take her outside,
you've got to put this head on her...

1099
01:21:57,112 --> 01:22:01,344
so people aren't shocked and horrified
by a headless girl walking around.’’

1100
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:05,409
Mr. Natural leaves and says, ‘‘Don't say
I never did anything for you.’’

1101
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:09,856
He gives the girl to Foont,
and Foont's getting excited.

1102
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:14,362
He's got this wondrous body all
to himself to do with whatever he wants.

1103
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:18,456
He says, ‘‘I like it better with just
the cap.’’ He knocks the fake head off.

1104
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,467
He's leading her to the wall...

1105
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:24,164
and she accidentally steps on
the fake head and smashes it.

1106
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,901
He pushes her against the wall,
pulls her clothes off...

1107
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:29,671
and he's admiring her firm butt.

1108
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:32,076
This is the part where I get excited
when I'm working on it.

1109
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:35,173
I enjoy drawing the female form.

1110
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,651
I make a lot of fuss to make sure
the figure comes out the way I want it.

1111
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,655
The males, I don't care what
they look like.

1112
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:44,385
So he starts to fuck her.

1113
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:47,826
He penetrates her from behind,
and he's getting really excited.

1114
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:50,330
At the same time he feels guilty.

1115
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:53,962
While he's in the middle of coming...

1116
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:57,766
he imagines her severed head...

1117
01:22:57,839 --> 01:23:00,899
and then her face condemning him.

1118
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,843
She says, ‘‘You little shit!’’

1119
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:06,403
Cut to Mr. Natural.
He's home, phone's ringing.

1120
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:10,281
‘‘I got home an hour ago.’’
Yeah, it's Foont. He's feeling guilty.

1121
01:23:12,854 --> 01:23:16,620
Foont wants to bring her back.
He can't handle it.

1122
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:18,784
Mr. Natural says,
‘‘Okay, bring her over.

1123
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:22,523
Make sure you put the head back on
before you take her outside.’’

1124
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:24,929
He realizes the head's been smashed.

1125
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,127
He doesn't know what to do.

1126
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:30,069
Actually, a lot of these poses
in these panels...

1127
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:33,539
I took from freeze-framing
the Fly Girls on ‘‘In Living Color’’.

1128
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:38,544
He ties up a shirt into a ball
and puts it on top of the cap.

1129
01:23:38,613 --> 01:23:40,547
Then he puts a hat on.

1130
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,810
He pushes her in the car.

1131
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:44,818
We cut to Mr. Natural's house.

1132
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:47,650
Mr. Natural's saying he's going
to regret it if he doesn't keep her.

1133
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:51,658
Mr. Natural says, ‘‘Forget it.
We'll put the head back.’’

1134
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:55,958
Mr. Natural unscrews the clamp,
pulls the pipe out of her.

1135
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,464
He reaches in.

1136
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:00,729
This is probably the most sickening,
disturbing panel in the story.

1137
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:03,635
Aline says it's the most disturbing part
of the whole thing.

1138
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:07,300
He's pulling hard, and he pulls
her head back out by her tongue.

1139
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:10,776
Her head was actually inside her body
all the time.

1140
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:14,747
Foont is very shocked,
then relieved that her head is back.

1141
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:18,343
Mr. Natural says, ‘‘Old African
witch doctor stuff. Nothing special.’’

1142
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:22,857
And she says, ‘‘That was so weird!’’
Mr. Natural says, ‘‘Yep.’’

1143
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:26,519
Then they both realize the head's back,
the trouble's back.

1144
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:30,257
She says what happened to her
and what did Mr. Natural do to her...

1145
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:33,459
and where does he get his crazy ideas?

1146
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:37,801
At this point, Foont feels guilty and
starts apologizing to the devil girl...

1147
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:41,968
for having done the deed to her
when she didn't have her head.

1148
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:44,170
She says, ‘‘What are you saying? ’'

1149
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:49,410
She realizes that Mr. Natural handed her
over to Foont for him to play with.

1150
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:53,818
She says, ‘‘You gave me to that shmuck to
play with as if I were a piece of meat.’’

1151
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,516
He says, ‘‘What the hell's
the difference? ’'

1152
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,786
He tries to get away
and she's chasing him.

1153
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,658
In the end, she's raging with anger
and she says...

1154
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:05,165
‘‘Where's a butcher knife? I'm going
to cut both your heads off!’’

1155
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:07,463
Typical comic book ending.

1156
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:10,732
I see a theme...

1157
01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:13,899
running through his work
that is very frightening.

1158
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:18,708
And it's the woman with her head
either cut off or somehow distorted...

1159
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:22,079
something done to it so that
nothing is left but the body.

1160
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:25,051
And the body, of course,
you can have sex with.

1161
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:30,422
When Crumb draws that little monster,
Mr. Natural...

1162
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:34,428
doing things you or I would not normally
think of doing with a headless woman...

1163
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:40,633
it is not intended, I imagine,
to be apologia for beheading...

1164
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:42,727
or an apologia for rape.

1165
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:45,898
But it is an acknowledgement
that these kinds of fantasy...

1166
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:49,239
actually do dwell in homo sapiens,
they're there.

1167
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:54,077
I'm saying that
it's very irresponsible to put...

1168
01:25:55,617 --> 01:26:00,418
dangerous sexual fantasies
on paper...

1169
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:04,049
and make them available to the public.

1170
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:08,562
It's important for women to not just run
in horror from pornographic images...

1171
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:12,566
and immediately think
they represent oppression...

1172
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:16,092
and the power of men
to degrade women.

1173
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:20,733
And to think, sometimes,
about the fact that they often are...

1174
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:23,470
They're fantasies of having power.

1175
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:26,878
They're fantasies
of being able to dominate...

1176
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:30,907
that come out of a fear
of precisely the opposite.

1177
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:35,012
Fear of not being able
to be attractive to women.

1178
01:26:35,089 --> 01:26:37,080
Impotence fears.

1179
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:41,322
And fears of powerlessness
in general.

1180
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:44,888
How do you feel about the way
he depicts women in his comics?

1181
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:47,400
He depicts his id in its pure form.

1182
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:51,404
The dark side of human nature
is in every person.

1183
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:53,633
That's what I was drawn to
in his work.

1184
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:57,610
That he could illustrate that
really clearly.

1185
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,842
It's unusual to see it.
I think it's always there.

1186
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:03,748
Does any of that bother you?

1187
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:07,310
He's not like that in other ways
as a person.

1188
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:08,878
He gets it out in his artwork.

1189
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:11,824
He fools around with other women.
How do you deal with that?

1190
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,827
I fool around with other men.

1191
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:18,289
I have hostilities toward women.
I admit it.

1192
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:21,631
It's out in the open.
I have to put it out there.

1193
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:24,501
Sometimes I think it's a mistake.
I should never have let it out.

1194
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:27,803
I'd be more well-Ioved.

1195
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:31,242
The whole thing would be easier
and cleaner if I didn't let it out.

1196
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:34,873
But it's in there,
and it's very strong.

1197
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:38,385
And it ruthlessly...

1198
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:41,354
forces itself out of me
onto the paper...

1199
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:43,515
for better or worse.

1200
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:46,856
When I was 9 or 10,
my brother collected ‘‘Zap Comix’’.

1201
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:50,921
When I saw those,
they really deeply, deeply...

1202
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:52,432
terrified me.

1203
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:57,197
I was deeply upset.
I looked at them and thought...

1204
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:00,764
‘‘This is adulthood?
This is what adult women are?

1205
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:02,810
This is what I grew up into? ’'

1206
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:05,141
It was horrifying.

1207
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:08,842
I wonder if you think about the effect
on people who read it...

1208
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:11,817
or what you're validating for boys.

1209
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:15,083
I just hope that somehow...

1210
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:17,750
revealing that truth about myself
is somehow helpful.

1211
01:28:17,825 --> 01:28:21,886
I hope it is. But I have to do it.
Maybe I shouldn't be allowed.

1212
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:25,228
Maybe I should be locked up
and my pencils taken away from me.

1213
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,394
I just don't know.
I really can't say.

1214
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:30,869
I can't defend myself.

1215
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:35,238
I was with my daughter Sophie watching
‘‘Goodfellows’’ on videotape.

1216
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:38,746
The violent part horrified her so deeply
she started getting a stomach ache.

1217
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:40,576
I shut it off,
wouldn't let her watch it.

1218
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:44,744
I think it's a great movie, truthful
movie. I got a lot out of seeing it.

1219
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:46,878
It's obviously not for a kid.

1220
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:50,583
Sometimes certain
harsh realities of life...

1221
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:53,889
You've got to protect your kids
a little bit from that.

1222
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:55,895
They don't understand
a lot of things yet.

1223
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:59,455
Not everything's for children.
Not everything's for everybody.

1224
01:29:00,635 --> 01:29:05,129
Have you gotten criticism about the way
you draw black people?

1225
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:08,642
Oh, yeah, but it all came
from white liberals.

1226
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:12,976
Here's an example of the kind of thing
I'm talking about in ‘‘Ooga Booga’’.

1227
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:16,210
It's actually a mockery of black people.

1228
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:20,550
It's a vomiting up
of Crumb's own racism...

1229
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:25,581
his own deepest
hostilities and fears.

1230
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:28,788
If you have a knee-jerk reaction,
and that's as far as you get...

1231
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:31,093
then you say he's a racist.

1232
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:34,965
But once you think about
how he's toying with that...

1233
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:39,336
how he's shoving it in your face...

1234
01:29:39,407 --> 01:29:41,967
you start to think
about your attitudes...

1235
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:45,945
and how the stereotypes came about,
and it gets complicated.

1236
01:29:47,515 --> 01:29:50,348
All that stuff I did in the late '60s...

1237
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:53,114
I didn't really know what it was about
when I did it.

1238
01:29:53,187 --> 01:29:56,384
It was very instinctive.
Somehow LSD liberated me in this way...

1239
01:29:56,457 --> 01:30:01,417
that allowed me to put it down
and not worry about what it meant.

1240
01:30:01,496 --> 01:30:04,158
I had a vague idea
that it meant something...

1241
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:08,032
but it was later that I'd look at it,
analyze it and see what it's about.

1242
01:30:09,003 --> 01:30:12,962
Somehow the term ‘‘nigger hearts’’
just came into my mind...

1243
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,668
as a product.

1244
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:19,304
It's like it's some black,
deep thing...

1245
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:22,508
in American collective mind
or something...

1246
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:27,350
that has to do with turning
everything over for a buck.

1247
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:30,949
I'm not sure exactly,
but it's some message like that.

1248
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:33,323
Quite a number of people
these days would like...

1249
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:37,330
this nice, milky vision of culture
in which it's all improving...

1250
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:41,664
and leads us all to this nice little
pie-in-the-sky moral heaven...

1251
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:44,796
where nobody's nasty to anybody else.

1252
01:30:44,872 --> 01:30:47,966
But the only thing is that
literature, culture, art...

1253
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:52,103
isn't put there to have
that pleasant, normative effect.

1254
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:56,344
Conservatives like to think great
works of art lead us towards democracy.

1255
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:58,942
Bull.

1256
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:02,387
There were speeches in Shakespeare that
were so full of hatred for the mob...

1257
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:05,324
they're passionately elitist,
passionately antidemocratic.

1258
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:09,887
What do you with someone like Celine,
a Nazi sympathizer yet a great novelist?

1259
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:13,559
What do you do with practically anybody
who's got a vision of the world...

1260
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:16,728
not in accord with
the present standards at Berkeley?

1261
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:14,221
They're all wearing Raiders
and 49ers jackets.

1262
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:17,230
Sophie wants us to get her
a 49ers jacket.

1263
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,794
Why do you want to live
in the midst of it?

1264
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:24,599
Like Hamlet,
I'm too scared to kill myself.

1265
01:32:24,672 --> 01:32:28,301
You gonna move to the south of France?
You gonna miss all this?

1266
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,537
I'II be out of here
in a couple more months.

1267
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:33,739
I can't live in it.
I can't take it.

1268
01:32:39,453 --> 01:32:43,412
They can't wait to have the money
to get their hands on this stuff.

1269
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:45,425
They live for it.

1270
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:55,201
It's a beautiful world.

1271
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:05,306
You gonna finish this one soon?

1272
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:09,338
It depends on when I have a chance
to pick up an oil brush again.

1273
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:13,319
You worked on this recently, right?
Did you do something to this recently?

1274
01:33:13,387 --> 01:33:18,450
When was the last time I painted?
I was working on that thing of Dian...

1275
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:21,290
that portrait of that New York floozie
you were running with.

1276
01:33:22,296 --> 01:33:25,493
- This one?
- This is a portrait number.

1277
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,232
You put things together
and watch the paint do stuff.

1278
01:33:29,303 --> 01:33:32,898
How come you put that
metallic-Iooking brassiere on her?

1279
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:37,343
Her personality was like that.
She had a hard, armored personality.

1280
01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:40,471
She was a broad underneath it.

1281
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:43,449
She would find that thing you put on her
really disturbing.

1282
01:33:43,517 --> 01:33:48,250
It just reflects the personality,
an icy, crazed expression in the eyes.

1283
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:51,450
But there's a warmth and reluctance
in the smile.

1284
01:33:51,525 --> 01:33:53,789
- You know what I mean?
- Interesting.

1285
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:56,056
- She's in therapy now.
- She is?

1286
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:58,496
She doesn't need therapy.
She fucks too hard.

1287
01:33:58,566 --> 01:34:00,898
How do you cure that except by death?

1288
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:07,199
You start from a blob. When you do
ink work, you start from a line.

1289
01:34:07,274 --> 01:34:10,402
Being fixated with...

1290
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:14,175
Like that one. This is also an example
of being fixated with line.

1291
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:16,842
I started getting into very detailed...

1292
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:22,048
You can see a very distinct line thing
in the character of it.

1293
01:34:22,123 --> 01:34:24,057
You're pleased with this
when you look at it now?

1294
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:26,355
I like the style a lot.

1295
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:29,123
This is Van Gogh shooting himself.

1296
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:32,632
- In a cornfield.
- What's the corn about?

1297
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:35,726
It's like that Walt Whitman line:

1298
01:34:35,803 --> 01:34:38,601
‘‘Quintillions ripen
and the quintillions green.’’

1299
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:43,770
He was out picking fruit,
a transient picker.

1300
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:47,007
He came to this realization:
the abundance of the farm thing.

1301
01:34:47,081 --> 01:34:49,914
The abundance of plant growth.

1302
01:34:49,984 --> 01:34:53,317
He wrote this line: ‘‘Quintillions ripen
and the quintillions green.’’

1303
01:34:53,387 --> 01:34:56,413
- The same thing with corn.
- A stylized Van Gogh painting.

1304
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:59,789
Corn has infinite ability,
like primal nature.

1305
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:02,590
- What's with Van Gogh shooting himself?
- His mind went to this place.

1306
01:35:02,663 --> 01:35:06,793
There's this infinite abundance,
like in an ear of corn.

1307
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:09,802
This is the first oil painting
you ever did, isn't it?

1308
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:13,397
It's the first oil I ever did. Yeah.

1309
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:16,602
You never drew before,
and it suddenly just came out of you.

1310
01:35:16,677 --> 01:35:18,440
It's like something was released
inside of you.

1311
01:35:18,512 --> 01:35:20,605
When I had that first epileptic fit
in sixth grade...

1312
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:24,549
I was drawing a picture of my face
with charcoal in art class.

1313
01:35:24,618 --> 01:35:27,644
I said, ‘‘Hey, you can draw.’’
It started working out.

1314
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:30,555
It was the first time I had
this artistic experience.

1315
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:34,151
It was so violent to me
that I had a fucking seizure.

1316
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:37,197
I ended up in the hospital
the next day.

1317
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:41,965
This is probably one of the last
comic covers Charles ever did.

1318
01:35:42,036 --> 01:35:47,167
It might be the very last one.
His psychotic bunny rabbits.

1319
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:49,436
In our late teens,
I persuaded Charles...

1320
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:52,877
that we should send away for
‘‘The Famous Artists Talent Test.’’

1321
01:35:52,947 --> 01:35:56,280
They had ads in magazines.
We each sent away for this test.

1322
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:59,114
I did mine legitimately,
the way you were supposed to.

1323
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:01,154
But Charles couldn't help himself.

1324
01:36:01,222 --> 01:36:06,023
You were supposed to complete the figure
by drawing a costume on it.

1325
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:08,561
But he put pasties on her tits...

1326
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:12,463
and started drawing weird,
psychotic characters in the background.

1327
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:14,592
Psychotic Mickey Mouse.

1328
01:36:14,668 --> 01:36:17,466
They had an outline
of this barn and tree.

1329
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:21,030
You were supposed to draw in textures
on surfaces.

1330
01:36:21,108 --> 01:36:24,168
They gave suggestions on
how to fill in the textures.

1331
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:27,339
That's his interpretation of that.

1332
01:36:27,414 --> 01:36:30,850
Here was your ability
to arrange elements in a picture.

1333
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:33,386
They give you objects.
You're supposed to make an arrangement.

1334
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:35,388
So he did this and this.

1335
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:39,760
‘‘Your imagination as an illustrator.
Complete this picture by adding...

1336
01:36:39,827 --> 01:36:42,921
whatever other figure or objects
you think are necessary.’’

1337
01:36:42,997 --> 01:36:46,558
So he drew this girl here.

1338
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:52,197
A week after this came in the mail,
a salesman showed up to grade our tests.

1339
01:36:52,273 --> 01:36:54,798
If you got a good grade,
you got the privilege...

1340
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:58,538
of paying $400 to take the course.

1341
01:36:58,612 --> 01:37:01,809
He looked at Charles...

1342
01:37:01,882 --> 01:37:04,578
at what he had done,
and he was speechless.

1343
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:06,381
He didn't know what to say.

1344
01:37:06,453 --> 01:37:10,355
He told me mine was good, I had a lot of
potential and I should take the course.

1345
01:37:10,424 --> 01:37:13,188
But Charles,
he wouldn't even speak to him.

1346
01:37:14,195 --> 01:37:18,894
He was pretty far gone
at that point already.

1347
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:23,795
This is some of his later work...

1348
01:37:23,871 --> 01:37:26,465
sort of the end of his comic period.

1349
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:28,804
About 1961. He's about 18.

1350
01:37:28,876 --> 01:37:32,573
He started developing this weird
wrinkle technique in his drawing...

1351
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:35,581
and it became stranger and stranger.

1352
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:38,447
Had nothing to do
with the outside world at all.

1353
01:37:38,519 --> 01:37:41,613
Became more and more ingrown
in this way.

1354
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:47,321
It had to do with his increasing
alienation from the world. Isolation.

1355
01:37:47,394 --> 01:37:49,328
He never went to pen and ink.

1356
01:37:49,396 --> 01:37:52,593
He never got beyond pencil and crayons.

1357
01:37:55,903 --> 01:37:59,270
This is some of the last
‘‘Treasure Island’’ stuff he did.

1358
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:01,774
This is late '61.

1359
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:08,945
It's beautifully drawn except
the wrinkle stuff gets out of hand.

1360
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:13,709
He got more and more obsessed
with that.

1361
01:38:14,688 --> 01:38:17,782
It gets real dark-looking.

1362
01:38:17,858 --> 01:38:20,053
He had this fascination
with the relationship...

1363
01:38:20,127 --> 01:38:24,063
between the kid and Long John Silver,
the pirate character...

1364
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:27,066
which he elaborated on endlessly.

1365
01:38:29,136 --> 01:38:33,163
This is one of our two-mans. You can see
he gradually added more and more text.

1366
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:36,869
The writing takes over.
Look at that.

1367
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:39,640
He lost interest in drawing...

1368
01:38:39,713 --> 01:38:42,511
and then he went
to this loony writing.

1369
01:38:47,121 --> 01:38:52,058
There's a certain phase of Charles' life
that had this compulsive graphomania.

1370
01:38:52,126 --> 01:38:55,960
He did dozens of these notebooks.
He gave me a bunch of them.

1371
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:58,590
People found them fascinating.

1372
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:02,625
This is upside down,
though it doesn't make any difference.

1373
01:39:02,703 --> 01:39:06,366
I don't know if it's upside down
or right side up.

1374
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,102
When he first started out,
it was readable...

1375
01:39:09,176 --> 01:39:12,543
and then it became
less and less readable.

1376
01:39:14,381 --> 01:39:18,681
What I definitely need is some kind
of external stimulation...

1377
01:39:18,752 --> 01:39:22,347
to rejuvenate me
and get me going again.

1378
01:39:22,423 --> 01:39:25,824
But I don't know how I'm going
to be able to arrange this eventually.

1379
01:39:25,893 --> 01:39:27,520
I don't know.

1380
01:39:27,594 --> 01:39:31,724
I'll have to start doing that
in a mental hospital.

1381
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:35,902
I remember this time we were
at Neal's house and Mary was there.

1382
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:41,272
Mary said, ‘‘I'm bored. I'm gonna take
a bath.’’ She went in the bathroom and...

1383
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:43,572
I told her not to do it.

1384
01:39:44,411 --> 01:39:48,074
Maxon's eyes glazed over
and he got kind of red.

1385
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:52,710
He got up as if he was in a trance
and he went up to the bathroom.

1386
01:39:52,786 --> 01:39:55,653
I said, ‘‘What are you doing?’’
He pushed the bathroom door open.

1387
01:39:55,723 --> 01:39:59,318
Mary was standing there naked
and she screamed.

1388
01:39:59,393 --> 01:40:02,362
She slammed the door.

1389
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:05,091
I said, ‘‘Maxon, come away.’’ I tried
to pull him away from the door.

1390
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:08,896
He was completely in a trance.
He pushed the door open again.

1391
01:40:08,969 --> 01:40:11,494
Mary yelled again.
Then Maxon fell on the floor...

1392
01:40:11,572 --> 01:40:14,234
had an 8-minute seizure.

1393
01:40:15,743 --> 01:40:19,873
What's with these Oriental women
you were into in this phase?

1394
01:40:19,947 --> 01:40:24,407
- You were attracted to Oriental women.
- I was when I first started doing this.

1395
01:40:24,485 --> 01:40:27,079
When you were in that phase.

1396
01:40:27,154 --> 01:40:30,487
The phase of molesting women
and getting in trouble with cops.

1397
01:40:30,557 --> 01:40:34,891
- Were you actually raping these women?
- No. I didn't get that much into it.

1398
01:40:34,962 --> 01:40:36,896
He'd goose them and run away.

1399
01:40:36,964 --> 01:40:39,125
You've got to do a lot of molesting
to get to rape.

1400
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:41,599
If you do a couple years of molesting,
you'II get to rape.

1401
01:40:43,804 --> 01:40:45,897
I started molesting when I was 18.

1402
01:40:45,973 --> 01:40:50,410
I started with Chinese women for some
crazy reason on subways in Philadelphia.

1403
01:40:50,477 --> 01:40:52,411
I went through different periods of it.

1404
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:56,939
But I'm out of it.
It's too much passion, too much animal.

1405
01:40:57,017 --> 01:41:01,283
Didn't they put you in some kind
of psycho ward for a few weeks?

1406
01:41:01,355 --> 01:41:04,347
Two weeks on Haldol will cure anything.

1407
01:41:04,425 --> 01:41:07,917
You'll do anything they tell you
after two weeks on Haldol.

1408
01:41:07,995 --> 01:41:10,555
For a sensible person
it's just terrible.

1409
01:41:10,631 --> 01:41:13,395
You get heavy into molesting.
It's a violent crime thing.

1410
01:41:13,467 --> 01:41:16,561
I get to the point where I start
pulling girls' shorts down.

1411
01:41:16,637 --> 01:41:20,733
I'm walking around this district
by the Marina, a shopping district.

1412
01:41:20,808 --> 01:41:24,141
This beautiful Jewish-looking girl...

1413
01:41:24,211 --> 01:41:26,179
with obscenely brief shorts on...

1414
01:41:26,246 --> 01:41:29,909
goes into this drugstore.

1415
01:41:29,983 --> 01:41:34,249
I'm in a fit. I gotta do this
to this broad. She's just too much.

1416
01:41:34,321 --> 01:41:39,349
I've gotta risk my whole life
just to do something to this broad.

1417
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:42,418
So I go in,
cold sweat all over the place.

1418
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:46,125
She doesn't notice. She's casually
looking over some shampoo.

1419
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:49,067
I'm trying not to be obtrusive.

1420
01:41:49,136 --> 01:41:53,937
She goes up to the counter. It's like
this complete, personal struggle...

1421
01:41:54,007 --> 01:41:56,942
about this moment
I gotta pull this risky trip.

1422
01:41:57,010 --> 01:42:00,446
I walk up behind her while
she's paying for the shampoo.

1423
01:42:00,514 --> 01:42:03,779
I grab the bottom of her shorts
and go...

1424
01:42:03,851 --> 01:42:08,879
They go all the way down, and her ass
pops out like a ripe peach.

1425
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:12,392
‘‘Jesus Christ!’’ she says.
‘‘There's someone there. '’

1426
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:16,520
Maybe 15 or 20 years from now
I'll be more willing to talk about it.

1427
01:42:16,597 --> 01:42:19,794
But not now.
I've still got too many scruples.

1428
01:42:19,867 --> 01:42:22,995
- Did you tell Maxon about them?
- He thinks you're putting it on.

1429
01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:26,506
Charles confessed to me
when we were adults that...

1430
01:42:26,573 --> 01:42:31,670
when we were teenagers, he had to stifle
the urge to stick a knife in my heart.

1431
01:42:31,745 --> 01:42:37,308
He'd be lying in bed, fighting the urge
to go to the kitchen for the knife.

1432
01:42:37,384 --> 01:42:42,481
I wanted to go to the basement,
get an ax and bash your skull in.

1433
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:45,223
I told Maxon.

1434
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:48,659
He didn't believe it.
He thought it was all part of the act.

1435
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:52,392
- He thinks the whole thing's an act.
- He thinks my mental sickness is an act.

1436
01:42:52,466 --> 01:42:55,264
He thinks you have a cushy position
in things...

1437
01:42:55,335 --> 01:42:58,270
because you got the mother's love
and he didn't.

1438
01:42:58,338 --> 01:43:00,670
That's what he thinks.

1439
01:43:00,741 --> 01:43:04,006
He must think I have reasons
for putting on this act.

1440
01:43:04,077 --> 01:43:06,671
What does he think
those reasons are?

1441
01:43:06,747 --> 01:43:10,683
I don't think he thinks it out
too deeply. He's just reacting.

1442
01:43:10,751 --> 01:43:14,915
He still has anger and resentment
because he wasn't loved by the mother.

1443
01:43:14,988 --> 01:43:18,287
I know what the homicidal tendencies
stem from now.

1444
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:21,589
It stemmed from an excessive degree
of narcissism.

1445
01:43:21,662 --> 01:43:26,463
It seems all I have to do is overcome
the excessive degree of narcissism...

1446
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:29,195
and my homicidal tendencies
will go away.

1447
01:43:29,269 --> 01:43:32,466
- You still have these tendencies?
- No, they're pretty well gone.

1448
01:43:32,539 --> 01:43:34,131
Think it's drugs?

1449
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:38,804
What's the connection between
narcissism and homicidal tendencies?

1450
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:42,315
When narcissism is wounded...

1451
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:44,942
it wants to strike back
at the person who wounded it.

1452
01:43:45,018 --> 01:43:48,181
- Did I wound your narcissism?
- Many, many times.

1453
01:43:48,255 --> 01:43:50,655
Many, many times.

1454
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:21,047
I'm at the point in meditation
where I have to use a bed of nails.

1455
01:44:21,121 --> 01:44:24,648
I'm not a great expert at the nails,
so I cover a portion of the nails...

1456
01:44:24,725 --> 01:44:28,320
with this thin bandana
so it's not too painful to me.

1457
01:44:28,395 --> 01:44:32,627
I have to regulate the amount of pain
that I take with it.

1458
01:44:43,377 --> 01:44:47,143
- How long can you sit on those?
- I can sit a couple hours.

1459
01:44:47,214 --> 01:44:48,738
This is quite easy.

1460
01:44:48,815 --> 01:44:52,046
The cloth cleans your intestines out
on the inside.

1461
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:56,078
You might say it gratifies
your intestines.

1462
01:44:56,156 --> 01:45:00,855
Every six weeks, regularly, I have
to pass it through my entire body.

1463
01:45:00,927 --> 01:45:06,229
And it takes three days
for it to come out the other side.

1464
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,894
You don't take the nails
on the street, right?

1465
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:12,132
They're prejudiced against people,
like in the financial district...

1466
01:45:12,205 --> 01:45:14,833
against someone praying in the street.

1467
01:45:14,908 --> 01:45:18,674
You go out with your beggar bowl
about every day.

1468
01:45:18,745 --> 01:45:22,237
I do it every day, once a day.
It's part of my whole thing.

1469
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:27,276
I have to go out and meet the public.
Put the bowl down, lock in and do it.

1470
01:45:27,354 --> 01:45:28,787
It's a dirty job.

1471
01:45:28,855 --> 01:45:32,985
- How long has he had this bed of nails?
- A couple years.

1472
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:36,257
He sits on it about
three or four times a day?

1473
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:39,493
- About once a day for a couple hours.
- Does he sleep on it?

1474
01:45:39,566 --> 01:45:42,501
No. It's not big enough to sleep on.
He just sits on it.

1475
01:45:42,569 --> 01:45:46,505
- Where did he get it? Did he buy it?
- You can't buy a bed of nails.

1476
01:45:46,573 --> 01:45:49,406
Just a minute. What is it? What?

1477
01:45:50,644 --> 01:45:52,578
Not too badly.

1478
01:45:56,316 --> 01:46:00,753
Remember, Mother, I'm under
the influence of medication.

1479
01:46:00,821 --> 01:46:05,019
That's helping me through this thing
to a certain extent, anyway.

1480
01:46:05,092 --> 01:46:08,061
- When did you start taking medication?
- About 20 years ago.

1481
01:46:08,128 --> 01:46:11,757
If only it would do something
about the inner anguish and pain.

1482
01:46:11,832 --> 01:46:14,357
You started taking it
after you attempted suicide?

1483
01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:17,198
I started taking it
after one of my suicide attempts.

1484
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:21,104
- You drank furniture polish.
- That was the first time.

1485
01:46:21,174 --> 01:46:25,941
I drank a bottle of furniture polish
and took an overdose of sleeping pills.

1486
01:46:26,012 --> 01:46:28,879
I chickened out at the last minute,
and went downstairs...

1487
01:46:28,949 --> 01:46:33,181
and asked Mother to take me to
the hospital to have my stomach pumped.

1488
01:46:33,253 --> 01:46:34,686
Jesus!

1489
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:41,027
There were two or three other attempts
besides that one.

1490
01:46:41,094 --> 01:46:44,757
This morning you were talking
about getting a lobotomy.

1491
01:46:44,831 --> 01:46:47,163
- Why not?
- Why not?

1492
01:46:49,202 --> 01:46:51,033
God, it's grim.

1493
01:46:51,104 --> 01:46:56,599
Charles confessed to me that when he
first saw ‘‘Treasure Island’’ in 1950...

1494
01:46:56,676 --> 01:47:01,340
he developed this crush on
Bobby Driscoll, and it never went away.

1495
01:47:01,415 --> 01:47:04,213
Bobby Driscoll's the kid
who plays Jim Hawkins.

1496
01:47:04,284 --> 01:47:08,812
The root of this whole obsession
was this kid that was in the movie.

1497
01:47:08,889 --> 01:47:13,724
He was drawing Bobby Driscoll,
this kid, endlessly.

1498
01:47:14,928 --> 01:47:16,725
When he told me this, I was shocked.

1499
01:47:16,797 --> 01:47:19,630
I had no idea that's what it was about.

1500
01:47:19,699 --> 01:47:22,930
I guess it's caused him
a lot of torment in his life.

1501
01:47:23,003 --> 01:47:27,497
He's never been able to have
any real sexual life at all.

1502
01:47:27,574 --> 01:47:30,168
He's never had sex.

1503
01:47:30,243 --> 01:47:33,440
I don't think any of them
got out, Mother.

1504
01:47:33,513 --> 01:47:37,074
When she yelled, ‘‘Get the hell out of
here!’’ I said, ‘‘Who's she talking to?’’

1505
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:40,745
And I said, ‘‘She's being pursued
by invisible enemies.’’

1506
01:47:43,323 --> 01:47:45,188
Who does she think they are?

1507
01:47:45,258 --> 01:47:49,752
I don't know exactly.
It's hard to tell.

1508
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:53,231
Charles?
Fix that curtain in the hallway.

1509
01:47:57,737 --> 01:48:00,137
The curtain in the hallway?

1510
01:48:26,299 --> 01:48:29,029
Come here. Come here.

1511
01:48:31,605 --> 01:48:34,506
Let me see that, please.

1512
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:41,070
Let me show you the painter.

1513
01:48:42,249 --> 01:48:44,308
I did that one and that one.

1514
01:48:44,384 --> 01:48:47,945
- That one's good.
- Let me show you what one it is.

1515
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:56,121
This is my character.

1516
01:48:56,196 --> 01:48:58,994
That's your character?

1517
01:48:59,065 --> 01:49:02,660
- What are biscuit teeth?
- Her dog!

1518
01:49:02,736 --> 01:49:05,933
- Biscuit Teeth.
- That's her dog?

1519
01:49:07,407 --> 01:49:10,899
Leave it the way it is.
Gimme a break.

1520
01:49:10,977 --> 01:49:13,878
Isn't that better? Look.

1521
01:49:13,947 --> 01:49:15,380
Much better.

1522
01:49:16,917 --> 01:49:21,513
Everything has to be black and white.
Everything has to be old-fashioned.

1523
01:49:21,588 --> 01:49:24,523
It just looks better like that.

1524
01:49:24,591 --> 01:49:27,924
The old man, I think, took off
pretty much for good...

1525
01:49:27,994 --> 01:49:32,260
when I was probably
five or six years old I guess.

1526
01:49:32,332 --> 01:49:35,199
I can't remember
that period of time very well.

1527
01:49:35,268 --> 01:49:37,930
But I didn't see him
too regularly after that.

1528
01:49:38,004 --> 01:49:41,565
He was over here for the most part:
Madison, Dixon.

1529
01:49:41,641 --> 01:49:43,700
Kind of gone most of the time.

1530
01:49:43,777 --> 01:49:48,077
I think he has sort of
a hard time emotionally.

1531
01:49:49,649 --> 01:49:53,745
Sometimes I'll feel like I want
to express affection to the old man.

1532
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:57,153
I feel like I want to put my arm
around him or shake his hand...

1533
01:49:57,223 --> 01:49:59,214
or get close in some way.

1534
01:49:59,292 --> 01:50:02,125
He can't do it.

1535
01:50:06,199 --> 01:50:10,397
- How tight?
- Pretty tight.

1536
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:13,439
What a disaster this is,
taking these records out.

1537
01:50:13,506 --> 01:50:16,475
I was planning to live here
until I died!

1538
01:50:16,543 --> 01:50:20,809
I didn't want to move out of this place,
and move all these damn records.

1539
01:50:21,948 --> 01:50:23,882
That'll teach you to have a hobby.

1540
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:29,013
Be careful with those.
You break them, I'll kill you.

1541
01:50:29,089 --> 01:50:31,853
My copy of Frank Bunch
and His Fuzzy Wuzzies.

1542
01:50:34,294 --> 01:50:36,888
Put those there on that futon.

1543
01:50:38,264 --> 01:50:41,756
Tight as you can.
Pull it out and I'll cut it.

1544
01:50:41,835 --> 01:50:44,167
Jesus, that wife of mine.

1545
01:50:44,237 --> 01:50:47,365
Having me move to France,
for God's sake.

1546
01:50:48,608 --> 01:50:51,577
It's too late now.
The die is cast.

1547
01:52:33,113 --> 01:52:35,775
A lot of stuff is in here
and some of it's in there.

1548
01:52:35,849 --> 01:52:39,080
Pulling up to here would be
the best thing. I don't know.

1549
01:52:39,152 --> 01:52:43,714
We'll have to look.
We have plywood we can put down.

1550
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:47,624
She's having a ball out there,
telling those guys what to do.

1551
01:52:51,898 --> 01:52:55,994
God, giant trucks are here,
everything.

1552
01:52:56,069 --> 01:52:57,502
Embarrassing.

1553
01:53:04,744 --> 01:53:08,908
You think those guys are going to be
sensitive to my record collection?

1554
01:53:09,983 --> 01:53:11,974
Bunch of football jocks.

1555
01:53:12,051 --> 01:53:16,044
‘‘Whaddya got here? A bunch
of old albums or somethin'?’’

1556
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:22,590
Is there anything you're going to miss
about this country?

1557
01:53:22,662 --> 01:53:26,325
A certain relaxed quality that people
have here that Europeans don't have.

1558
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:28,196
They're more formal.

1559
01:53:28,268 --> 01:53:30,532
America's a big ‘‘slobville’’?

1560
01:53:30,603 --> 01:53:34,539
I went to get my friend’s belongings
in Eureka.

1561
01:53:34,607 --> 01:53:37,508
It was at these people's house.
I went into their living room.

1562
01:53:37,577 --> 01:53:41,809
They had this chair that was
a gold plastic football helmet...

1563
01:53:41,881 --> 01:53:44,406
with a red and blue padded seat.

1564
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:49,581
They had double-wide couches and
a four-foot TV screen with Nintendo.

1565
01:53:49,656 --> 01:53:51,590
A Ninja Turtle game was on.

1566
01:53:51,658 --> 01:53:55,617
A giant, fat teenager
was sitting there, mesmerized.

1567
01:53:55,695 --> 01:53:57,629
You don't see
too much of that in France.

1568
01:53:59,399 --> 01:54:02,926
How do you feel
about leaving your family here?

1569
01:54:03,002 --> 01:54:06,301
I don't have any feelings about it
one way or the other.

1570
01:54:06,372 --> 01:54:07,862
What do I care?

1571
01:54:07,941 --> 01:54:11,741
Never see that mother or brother anyway.
Talks to them like once a year.

1572
01:54:11,811 --> 01:54:14,609
What about Jesse?

1573
01:54:14,681 --> 01:54:17,081
He's devastated that we're leaving.

1574
01:54:17,150 --> 01:54:19,778
On the other hand, we told him
he could come and stay with us there.

1575
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:23,949
He's thrilled about that.
We gave him $500 for plane fare...

1576
01:54:24,023 --> 01:54:26,253
so he's going to come.

1577
01:54:26,326 --> 01:54:30,626
- How about Max?
- Max I feel bad about.

1578
01:54:30,697 --> 01:54:34,155
He doesn't have too many other people
to talk to.

1579
01:54:34,234 --> 01:54:37,726
I'm probably his closest
human relationship in the world.

1580
01:54:42,141 --> 01:54:44,609
These are all records?

1581
01:54:44,677 --> 01:54:46,975
Those 78s you were talking about?

1582
01:54:47,046 --> 01:54:48,479
Yep.

1583
01:54:51,751 --> 01:54:54,743
So I've got no patience
for Hollywood bullshit.

1584
01:54:56,222 --> 01:54:59,817
I can't think in those terms.

1585
01:54:59,893 --> 01:55:04,296
I've already got so much of my life
wasted with those people down there.

1586
01:55:04,364 --> 01:55:08,300
Animation? Forget it. No.
I'm not interested in it at all.

1587
01:55:08,368 --> 01:55:12,464
There hasn't been a decent animated film
made in this country since 1940.

1588
01:55:12,538 --> 01:55:15,735
‘‘Cheery Pop Tart’’ is an abomination.

1589
01:55:15,808 --> 01:55:18,834
Larry Wells is an idiot.
It's going to be a piece of garbage.

1590
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:21,710
I'm not interested.
All right.

1591
01:55:21,781 --> 01:55:23,214
So long.

1592
01:55:28,121 --> 01:55:32,421
I was on a conference call with Charles
Webb, a friend of Dan O'Neill's.

1593
01:55:32,492 --> 01:55:35,950
They're putting together
the ‘‘Cherry Pop Tart’’ film.

1594
01:55:36,029 --> 01:55:38,463
They got on the phone with
some guy in L.A. who says...

1595
01:55:38,531 --> 01:55:42,797
‘‘Hey! I'm your kind of guy.
Remember 'Tommy Toilet'? I love it!’’

1596
01:55:47,307 --> 01:55:49,468
They want to make a movie?

1597
01:55:49,542 --> 01:55:54,912
The natural film, of course.
It's a ‘‘go’’ project.

1598
01:55:56,983 --> 01:56:01,386
This is how I felt
after that last hell week...

1599
01:56:01,454 --> 01:56:04,150
of you filming me here.

1600
01:56:04,223 --> 01:56:07,818
‘‘How perfectly goddamned delightful
it all is, to be sure.’’

1601
01:56:07,894 --> 01:56:11,159
When I was a kid, if I ever started
showing enthusiasm for anything...

1602
01:56:11,230 --> 01:56:13,164
by brother Charles would say...

1603
01:56:13,232 --> 01:56:16,668
‘‘How perfectly goddamned delightful
it all is, to be sure.’’

1604
01:56:16,736 --> 01:56:19,569
Always take the wind
out of my sails.

1605
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:22,267
Even though I don't see him often,
whenever I'm with him...

1606
01:56:22,342 --> 01:56:26,244
it revives that keen awareness
of that...

1607
01:56:26,312 --> 01:56:31,375
of being very removed
or extremely separated...

1608
01:56:31,451 --> 01:56:33,715
from the rest of humanity
and the world in general.

1609
01:56:33,786 --> 01:56:36,687
I kinda like that feeling.

1610
01:56:36,756 --> 01:56:40,317
‘‘How perfectly goddamned delightful
it all is, to be sure.’’

1611
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:17,826
Fix it, Charles. Put back the towel
the way I had it.

1612
01:57:17,897 --> 01:57:19,831
First put the towel up.

1613
01:57:21,801 --> 01:57:24,463
Watch you don't pull the shade
all the way off the thing.

1614
01:57:24,537 --> 01:57:25,970
I won't.

1615
01:57:28,808 --> 01:57:32,244
Can't come in and disrupt
people's house like this!

1616
01:57:32,311 --> 01:57:33,471
Where are the babies?

1617
01:57:33,546 --> 01:57:35,878
I don't know. I think
that little girl is in my room.
