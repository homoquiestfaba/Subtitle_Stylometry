1
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:48,602
My poor baby.

2
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,603
Who has stolen the child's dream?

3
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:28,945
The mad genius Krank
in his evil scheme.

4
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:32,645
To what vicious depths
will he not descend?

5
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,348
Will the tale turn to tragedy...

6
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,414
or have a happy end?

7
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:33,773
Step up, ladies and gentlemen!

8
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:35,816
Step right up! Come closer.

9
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:37,544
Don't be afraid.

10
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:40,052
See the strongest man in the world.

11
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:43,318
Look at those chains,
made of the same steel...

12
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,121
as that used to lift...

13
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:47,627
Yes, my friends...

14
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:49,526
The true light is invisible.

15
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:51,861
Penetrate the corridor of shadows...

16
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:55,801
and you will enter
the world of the chosen ones.

17
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,929
Renounce the gift of sight.

18
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:00,872
I know there are skeptics among you...

19
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:03,877
afraid to share with us
the dead of night.

20
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:06,880
Be brave.
Renounce your gift of sight.

21
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:09,883
Pluck out your eyes.
Come and join us.

22
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:12,545
Help us build a better world.

23
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,114
The crusher Bones is going to try
once more to shatter steel...

24
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:22,128
only using the power
of his mighty arms.

25
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,790
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
I want absolute silence...

26
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,697
during the demonstration.

27
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:29,861
I must beg of you,
for your own safety...

28
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:31,962
not to look him in the eye...

29
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,406
because his power of concentration
is so great...

30
00:05:35,476 --> 00:05:38,570
that he might provoke
a cerebral hemorrhage...

31
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:40,580
in the weaker ones among you.

32
00:05:40,648 --> 00:05:42,912
Mr. One, ready?
And now, attention!

33
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,383
Little thief!

34
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:52,551
Stealing money from orphans.
I'll teach you!

35
00:05:52,627 --> 00:05:54,322
Let go of that!

36
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,327
What's going on?
What's the matter?

37
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,333
The poor man's not well.

38
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:14,627
Don't move!
Don't move or I'll waste you!

39
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,239
Denree!

40
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,781
Kill him!

41
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:22,351
- Who's that?
- He's the strong man at the fun fair.

42
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:23,987
I don't know him.

43
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:27,291
What do you want?

44
00:10:36,477 --> 00:10:38,877
I have lost little brother.

45
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,185
He didn't come all by himself.

46
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:07,207
Well, well, kiddies, hard at work?

47
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:11,344
It looks like you're doing
really well.

48
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:13,380
Thanks for waiting for us.

49
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:16,673
Thank you.

50
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:32,222
Just remember,
my ears are so sharp...

51
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,563
that I can hear you think.

52
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:47,739
Go buy yourself some sweets.

53
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:55,354
Don't overdo it.

54
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:57,356
Come on. Move your bum.

55
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,118
Go on. Here.

56
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:05,390
Move it!

57
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:12,237
Get the tools and let's beat it.

58
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:15,638
Move it!

59
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:17,802
Those rotten Cyclops.

60
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:20,745
Don't worry.
We know where to find them.

61
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:27,277
And him?
What about him?

62
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:30,289
You helped us out.
Here. Now we're even.

63
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,962
Hey, girl. Cyclops.
You know where to find Cyclops?

64
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,735
Will you get lost?

65
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,309
Beat it!

66
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:56,906
<i>Happy birthday, Uncle dear</i>

67
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,248
<i>Our wish is most sincere</i>

68
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,778
<i>We hope this cake of ours
will bring you happiness</i>

69
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:05,120
<i>Good fortune and success</i>

70
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:07,126
Wait till the candles are blown out!

71
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:10,391
<i>In fair or foul weather
We'll always be together</i>

72
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:14,191
Happy birthday, Uncle Irvin.

73
00:13:14,268 --> 00:13:16,202
A cake for me?

74
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,204
You're really too kind.

75
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,803
Are you ready, children?

76
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:26,937
Not you.
You've got a cold.

77
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:30,444
One, two.

78
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:36,289
What is all this bellowing about?

79
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:41,224
But, sweetheart,
it's Irvin's birthday.

80
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:43,160
Irvin's birthday?

81
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,722
Why, of course.
How could I have forgotten?

82
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,529
Let us celebrate.

83
00:13:48,602 --> 00:13:50,866
Let us all make merry.

84
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:54,635
Everyone, let's shout!
Scream out!

85
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,542
Krank, come back.
I had a thought last night.

86
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:01,274
If these children
only have nightmares...

87
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:04,078
it's perhaps
because the evil is in you.

88
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:06,745
Why not seek the cause
of your torment...

89
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,414
in the molecular study
of your own tears?

90
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,924
Who could make me cry?

91
00:14:11,992 --> 00:14:13,823
Well, boss...

92
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,829
we could make you cry
with laughter.

93
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:24,193
<i>I am a gnome
a bag of bones</i>

94
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:27,736
<i>A man of means
and full of beans</i>

95
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,844
<i>The girls in Spain
sing my refrains</i>

96
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,414
<i>I've such a pain
that it's insane</i>

97
00:14:45,526 --> 00:14:47,426
You mustn't be angry.

98
00:14:47,494 --> 00:14:49,928
Your brothers are doing their best.

99
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,130
My brothers?

100
00:14:59,206 --> 00:15:01,800
May I give it a try?

101
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,139
Go ahead, mollusk.

102
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:07,472
Once upon a time,
there was an inventor so gifted...

103
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,709
that he could create life.

104
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,048
- Truly remarkable man.
- Ah, a fairy tale.

105
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,248
I can already feel tears
in my eyes.

106
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:18,723
Since he had no wife or children...

107
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,556
he decided to make them
in his laboratory.

108
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:23,994
He started with his wife
and fashioned her...

109
00:15:24,064 --> 00:15:27,056
into the most beautiful princess
in the world.

110
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:31,332
Alas, a wicked genetic fairy
cast a spell on the inventor...

111
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:35,808
so much so that the princess
was only knee-high to a grasshopper.

112
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:41,308
He then cloned six children
in his own image.

113
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:44,111
Faithful, hardworking,
they were so alike...

114
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:46,118
no one could tell them apart.

115
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:49,883
But fate tricked him again,
giving them all sleeping sickness.

116
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,860
Craving someone to talk to,
he grew in a fish tank...

117
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:57,488
a poor migraine-ridden brain.

118
00:15:57,564 --> 00:16:01,432
And then, at last,
he created his masterpiece...

119
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,960
more intelligent than
the most intelligent man on Earth.

120
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:08,201
But, alas, the inventor
made a serious mistake.

121
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:11,711
While his creation was intelligent,
he, too, had a defect.

122
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:14,406
He never, ever had a dream.

123
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:17,450
You can't imagine
how quickly he grew old...

124
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,611
because he was so unhappy.

125
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:29,289
Boss.

126
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,092
There!

127
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:35,864
An eye dropper, quick!

128
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:38,029
An eye dropper!

129
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:56,222
Then the poor masterpiece
became so crazed...

130
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,657
that he believed
a single teardrop could save him.

131
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:02,320
And, after committing
many cruel deeds...

132
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,421
he died a horrible death...

133
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:07,331
never knowing
what it is to dream.

134
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,834
Get out!

135
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,496
All of you, get out!

136
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,103
Good-bye, Uncle. Happy birthday.
See you tonight.

137
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:20,673
Silence...

138
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:22,180
you glub!

139
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:56,443
What do you expect us
to do with that?

140
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:58,780
I wouldn't waste a nail
to hang it up.

141
00:17:58,852 --> 00:18:01,286
But it's pretty, isn't it?

142
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:03,289
Don't get smart with us.

143
00:18:03,357 --> 00:18:05,655
The picklock won't always
be there to save your behind.

144
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,618
All right, get lost.

145
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:16,999
- That's all?
- Afraid so.

146
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,004
If you keep being sassy...

147
00:18:19,072 --> 00:18:20,539
You'll be sorry.

148
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:23,633
There's no shortage
of orphans, Miette.

149
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,685
Listen carefully, Tadpole.

150
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:37,588
You don't want to go
to the hole, do you?

151
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,923
- It's very cold there.
- And pitch black.

152
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,859
And full of spiders.

153
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,921
So give us all the rest.
The rest.

154
00:18:49,236 --> 00:18:51,602
There's a fine lad.

155
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:56,267
See? When you want to.

156
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,573
Now, the second shift.

157
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:44,147
The neighborhood's calm, isolated.
But be careful.

158
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,556
You never know.
There's a backyard.

159
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:48,924
You'll go that way
with all the stuff.

160
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:51,361
On the landing,
there are three doors.

161
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:53,365
One is locked from inside.

162
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:56,095
That's the one that must be forced.

163
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:58,160
Behind is what interests us.

164
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:00,572
Here's the prize.

165
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:05,141
It's identical to the one
where he hides his loot.

166
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:14,176
The problem with this safe:
It takes two hours to crack it.

167
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,279
Two hours?
We're going to get caught.

168
00:20:16,356 --> 00:20:20,486
We have no choice, unless you know
someone capable of carrying it.

169
00:20:34,975 --> 00:20:36,567
Somebody got in.

170
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:41,877
- You big idiot!
- He's right here now.

171
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:45,145
Do I pay you to sleepwalk?
Who is this guy?

172
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:47,311
- Don't ask me.
- I know who he is.

173
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:50,823
The strong man at the fair,
the one who breaks his chains.

174
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:57,157
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

175
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:53,442
Nice going, Mr. One.

176
00:22:53,513 --> 00:22:56,448
One don't like whistles.
One not thief.

177
00:22:56,516 --> 00:23:00,509
A thief? Who's a thief?
We're not stealing, just borrowing.

178
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,248
What he said?

179
00:23:02,322 --> 00:23:05,917
He said you can take it back.
It just won't be as heavy.

180
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:13,361
<i>- The true light.
- Little brother.</i>

181
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:17,631
<i>Renounce the gift of sight
and penetrate the corridor of shadows...</i>

182
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:19,467
<i>the world of the blind.</i>

183
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:23,373
That guy is crazy.
The Octopus will kill us.

184
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,412
Tell her I'll bring him back.
I won't be long.

185
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:29,642
<i>Help us build a better world...</i>

186
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:32,651
<i>or we shall witness
a reign of terror.</i>

187
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:35,984
One! Where do you think you're going?

188
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:38,991
Cyclops truck.
Denree, little brother.

189
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,993
What about the truck?

190
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:43,753
Cyclops truck.

191
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:47,227
Kidnap Denree.

192
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,234
Kidnap little brother.

193
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:53,261
You know something?
You won't find Cyclops truck like that.

194
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,241
When you get there,
someone will have eaten Denree.

195
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,743
The wolf will have eaten him.

196
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:04,014
Take a break.
No use wearing out your shoes.

197
00:24:04,084 --> 00:24:06,518
I know where the truck's going.

198
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:13,648
Miette and One together?

199
00:24:13,727 --> 00:24:15,422
And then what?

200
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,589
And anyway, how old
was this brother of yours?

201
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:23,863
Little, little brother.

202
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,368
Found him...

203
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,534
one night...

204
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:34,774
on his rubbish bin, crying.

205
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:38,041
One comes close.

206
00:24:40,086 --> 00:24:41,781
Discover...

207
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:47,351
Okay, I can guess the rest.

208
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:50,885
He's just like I thought.
He's too little to bother.

209
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:53,899
Let's go.
We have to get out of here.

210
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:05,174
Stupid!

211
00:25:05,245 --> 00:25:07,304
Lmbecile! Idiot!

212
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,385
Have you finished?
My crystal glasses are broken!

213
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:15,387
You'll crack my chandelier!

214
00:25:23,663 --> 00:25:25,631
Are you calmer now?

215
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:30,135
One look for Denree.

216
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:43,205
See you.

217
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,966
Oh, come on, fat head.

218
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,641
- Where did those brats go?
- I don't know.

219
00:26:14,714 --> 00:26:17,842
It's the big guy's fault.
Miette's different since he came.

220
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:22,149
Does he have all the jewels?
That's all he's interested in?

221
00:26:22,222 --> 00:26:25,020
You had big ideas?
Poor little Tadpole.

222
00:26:25,091 --> 00:26:28,720
You haven't fallen in love, too,
like the others? Get to bed!

223
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,229
- Filthy brats.
- All the same.

224
00:26:31,297 --> 00:26:33,731
We really can't count on them.

225
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,564
- Raise crows, they'll rip out...
- Your eyes.

226
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:40,970
- It's the best ones who want to go.
- It's not the first time it's happened.

227
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,065
It's always the same old story.

228
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,408
- Remember little Lucas six years ago?
- And Marcus before.

229
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,970
Yes, Marcus.
I'd almost forgotten him.

230
00:26:53,586 --> 00:26:56,851
- When we think...
- Of everything we've done for them.

231
00:26:58,324 --> 00:27:00,815
And if she had an accident?

232
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,393
You never know.

233
00:27:45,305 --> 00:27:48,706
At that moment, the winkles
suddenly break into a dance...

234
00:27:48,775 --> 00:27:52,404
then cast off their shells
and begin to use them as megaphones...

235
00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:54,070
to announce the concert.

236
00:27:54,147 --> 00:27:56,012
Winkles, winkles.
Shells, shells.

237
00:27:56,082 --> 00:28:00,348
And then, at that moment...

238
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,389
all the winkles
cast off their shells...

239
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,721
and use them as megaphones
to announce the concert.

240
00:28:06,793 --> 00:28:10,422
The winkles?
The winkles cast off their shells?

241
00:28:10,496 --> 00:28:12,225
Please continue.

242
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:15,096
Continue, and with colors as well.

243
00:28:15,168 --> 00:28:16,760
Yes, yes, yes.

244
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:20,533
Then the hammerhead shark plays
xylophone with the catfish bones.

245
00:28:20,607 --> 00:28:23,940
The walrus plays
the Jew's harp with the...

246
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,841
the sperm whale's suspenders.

247
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,904
The sea is blue like the sky...

248
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:31,746
and the sky is blue
like the South Seas.

249
00:28:31,818 --> 00:28:35,254
And I don't know
if I'm swimming in the sky or...

250
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:38,950
or flying at the bottom
of the sea.

251
00:28:39,025 --> 00:28:41,425
I swear it gives me the shivers.

252
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:45,856
Shivers? Shivers all over.

253
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,730
And igloos?
Oh, yes, tell me about the igloos.

254
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:51,668
Igloos that turn into mushrooms.

255
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,081
Ah, it's you, my boy.
I was expecting you.

256
00:29:06,152 --> 00:29:09,952
Not so loud. Turn it down.
The boss might hear you.

257
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:13,959
The boss? He's out of a test tube,
like all of us.

258
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:16,962
Lay the boy in the sarcophagus
and come here.

259
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,560
But before...

260
00:29:25,538 --> 00:29:27,233
Well, you promised me...

261
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,332
What's tormenting you, my son?

262
00:29:31,044 --> 00:29:35,310
Well, this story that among us
there's an original clone...

263
00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:37,508
different from the others.

264
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,175
Is that true?

265
00:29:39,252 --> 00:29:42,688
Of course it's true. The others
are nothing but cheap copies...

266
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:45,918
while the original one is unique.

267
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,688
- Unique?
- Yes.

268
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,888
And do you know who it is?

269
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:55,229
Do you really want to know?
Connect yourself to the child.

270
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,333
- To the child?
- Yes.

271
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:05,036
Connect myself to the child?
But I can't.

272
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,712
It's forbidden.

273
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,611
Exactly.

274
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,880
The others wouldn't dare,
but you, you can do it...

275
00:30:13,953 --> 00:30:15,853
because you're the original.

276
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:17,389
Me?

277
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,488
I'm the original?

278
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:26,189
But it's not lonely
being the original?

279
00:30:26,265 --> 00:30:29,701
All the penguins, the centipedes,
everyone applauds.

280
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:33,227
Except, even if you climb
to the treetops...

281
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:36,173
it's impossible to catch
the candy floss.

282
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:39,302
And so, everybody climbs
to the top of the mountain...

283
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,644
except the giraffes who, of course,
stay in one spot...

284
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,307
munching the clouds.

285
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:47,084
Sleep.

286
00:30:48,154 --> 00:30:50,088
Sleep, my little one.

287
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,527
I am the sandman...

288
00:30:55,595 --> 00:30:57,529
and you can't resist me.

289
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,996
Your eyelids are so heavy.

290
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,059
Sleep, my little one.

291
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,437
The snowflakes evaporate...

292
00:31:12,512 --> 00:31:15,413
and then turn into hailstones.

293
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:18,274
In the farmyards...

294
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:25,616
the turkeys scramble towards...

295
00:31:29,996 --> 00:31:31,588
the hailstones.

296
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:41,799
The better to peck them?

297
00:31:41,874 --> 00:31:44,866
And then when the children's voices
cry for help...

298
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,707
the chickens are merciless.

299
00:32:00,726 --> 00:32:02,159
There.

300
00:32:02,228 --> 00:32:04,958
Now he's going to come around
very nicely.

301
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:07,556
- Who, the boss?
- No, the child.

302
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:09,726
He's a real nightmare factory.

303
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,462
- What's that? A fuse blew!
- Perfect.

304
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:23,147
Be careful.
Someone will hear you.

305
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:32,691
It's hard to be original.

306
00:32:32,758 --> 00:32:36,353
Now, throw this message...
uh, bottle into the sea.

307
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:38,488
- Yes.
- Go on!

308
00:32:47,773 --> 00:32:53,211
<i>May someone find my plea
to get it over with.</i>

309
00:33:58,344 --> 00:33:59,834
I...

310
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,743
Gabriel Marie...

311
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:08,043
I came into this world
with open eyes...

312
00:34:09,188 --> 00:34:11,622
but I saw a world...

313
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:14,626
that was a world of dogs.

314
00:34:14,694 --> 00:34:16,286
Litter of dogs!

315
00:34:18,364 --> 00:34:20,924
And so, the creator...

316
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,265
sent me down here to Earth...

317
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:28,467
to recover the power...

318
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:32,033
that men have illegally seized.

319
00:34:33,512 --> 00:34:35,946
My brothers...

320
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:40,145
you who have joined me
in this struggle...

321
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:44,451
understand that together
we must fight...

322
00:34:44,523 --> 00:34:46,616
human beings...

323
00:34:46,692 --> 00:34:49,889
from their own grounds.

324
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,953
The world...

325
00:34:52,031 --> 00:34:54,499
of appearances.

326
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:18,984
I thought we had agreed
on half a dozen.

327
00:35:19,058 --> 00:35:23,085
But you know it's becoming
more and more difficult.

328
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,131
People are suspicious.
They've put up posters.

329
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,427
In any case, this batch
is as fresh as they come.

330
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,837
Not one of them
is over five years old.

331
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:43,645
Listen. Let us have
maybe a couple of hours...

332
00:35:43,716 --> 00:35:46,014
and we'll sort this thing out.

333
00:35:59,899 --> 00:36:02,834
Only the third eye...

334
00:36:04,637 --> 00:36:07,401
will enable you to enter...

335
00:36:07,473 --> 00:36:10,840
the world of appearances.

336
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,377
But beware...

337
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:19,276
because this sordid world
of temptation and perversion...

338
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:23,378
is also the world of desire.

339
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:28,624
Try, Brother Angel Joseph...

340
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:32,229
to discover it...

341
00:36:32,298 --> 00:36:34,766
without your losing sight...

342
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:36,859
of the only true light.

343
00:36:38,804 --> 00:36:40,396
Be strong.

344
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,005
My brothers...

345
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,101
our grace...

346
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:49,306
our great superior race...

347
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:52,316
shall reign once more...

348
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:54,545
on Earth!

349
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:57,452
From that day on...

350
00:36:57,523 --> 00:36:59,684
our faithful third eye...

351
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,319
will become useless...

352
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:05,227
as the world of appearances...

353
00:37:05,297 --> 00:37:08,494
will be abolished.

354
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,793
It's Denree.

355
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:16,370
I see!

356
00:37:20,846 --> 00:37:23,610
What's that?

357
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:26,116
That, Brother Angel Joseph...

358
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:28,119
is a female.

359
00:37:29,155 --> 00:37:31,817
- A female.
- Do you have a problem?

360
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:41,457
What's that?

361
00:37:41,534 --> 00:37:43,798
That is a condemned man.

362
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,740
Take them. Go on!

363
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,744
Come back when those idiots
have had enough.

364
00:37:56,715 --> 00:37:59,650
Search her!

365
00:37:59,718 --> 00:38:02,084
What is it?

366
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:08,349
Kill her!

367
00:38:08,427 --> 00:38:10,054
She's clean.

368
00:38:10,129 --> 00:38:13,656
Then tomorrow night at Pier 24.

369
00:38:29,748 --> 00:38:31,272
100,000.

370
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,620
We'll never get half that.

371
00:38:36,956 --> 00:38:39,015
One more scrap of information.

372
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,889
A girl in a red dress...

373
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:45,555
with a big moron.

374
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,194
We found these on them.

375
00:38:49,268 --> 00:38:52,203
But there was much more in the...

376
00:38:53,138 --> 00:38:55,072
What'll you do with them?

377
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,681
A midnight snack for the fishes,
tonight, Pier 24.

378
00:39:08,754 --> 00:39:10,745
A midnight snack for the fishes.

379
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:16,527
- Irvin?
- Such a migraine.

380
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,923
You know all about feelings.

381
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,528
Won't you try to help me?

382
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:28,164
Won't you explain why all those children
only have nightmares?

383
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,435
'Cause you were their nightmare.

384
00:39:30,509 --> 00:39:33,603
You can persecute
all the children in the world...

385
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:36,113
but there's one thing
you'll never have.

386
00:39:36,181 --> 00:39:38,206
- What?
- A soul.

387
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:45,189
Because you believe you have one?

388
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,350
You don't even have a body.

389
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:51,453
He who created us
made us all monsters.

390
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:55,261
No, Krank, you're wrong.
You are the only monster here.

391
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:58,030
Be quiet!
He's the only one responsible.

392
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:01,470
For that, I say I'm innocent.
I'm innocent!

393
00:40:12,885 --> 00:40:14,375
Anyway...

394
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:20,148
I thank you for your help.

395
00:40:20,225 --> 00:40:24,059
Hurry up! And don't break
any of the baubles.

396
00:40:25,397 --> 00:40:28,093
Well done.
And don't cut yourself.

397
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:37,003
Are you sure that we're doing
the right thing?

398
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:39,340
Of course, my pet.
All children love it.

399
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:41,106
Lift your elbow.

400
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,205
Why worry, Krank?

401
00:40:43,282 --> 00:40:46,308
If you're sincere,
you have nothing to lose.

402
00:41:08,273 --> 00:41:10,332
How are you, Marcello?

403
00:41:13,445 --> 00:41:15,140
What's it to you?

404
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:19,548
We need you, Marcello,
and your creepy-crawlies.

405
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:22,553
Have you still got the knack?

406
00:41:22,621 --> 00:41:24,714
No, please, not again.

407
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,519
I paid enough already.

408
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,295
- Nice place...
- You've got here, Marcello.

409
00:41:34,233 --> 00:41:37,532
I'm glad to see
it hasn't changed much.

410
00:41:49,014 --> 00:41:51,949
You know, I never liked
that blue cage.

411
00:41:54,253 --> 00:41:57,188
You were always so kind
to us, Marcello.

412
00:41:57,256 --> 00:41:59,918
- It's only fair...
- That we look after you...

413
00:41:59,992 --> 00:42:01,425
Today.

414
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:06,397
- A little girl in a red dress...
- With a big moron.

415
00:42:06,465 --> 00:42:08,262
We want him.

416
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,767
And what do I do with her?

417
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:15,640
A midnight snack for the fishes.

418
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,414
Come on, my little flea.

419
00:42:59,852 --> 00:43:01,319
There, there.

420
00:43:01,386 --> 00:43:03,320
Easy does it.

421
00:43:03,388 --> 00:43:05,549
Midnight snack for the fishes.

422
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:25,393
Will you shut up, you idiots?

423
00:45:37,476 --> 00:45:40,036
- It wasn't me.
- I don't care.

424
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,275
Work this out among yourselves.

425
00:45:46,385 --> 00:45:48,478
How dare you hit the original.

426
00:45:48,553 --> 00:45:50,987
You, the original?
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

427
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:24,614
Miette...

428
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:28,091
One will die?

429
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,425
You're born in the gutter.
You end up in the port.

430
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:37,391
Miette too little.

431
00:46:39,538 --> 00:46:42,006
Not as little as all that.

432
00:46:55,787 --> 00:46:57,379
Five thousand on the kid.

433
00:46:57,456 --> 00:46:59,822
Ten thousand on the monster.

434
00:47:06,665 --> 00:47:09,828
There are pebbles in the meat pie.

435
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:12,802
There are pebbles, bits of...

436
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:34,856
- Did you hear anything?
- Just them crazy birds.

437
00:47:34,926 --> 00:47:37,861
- There's something over there.
- I don't see anything.

438
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:15,798
- Who is that guy there?
- What's all that monkey business?

439
00:48:21,173 --> 00:48:22,606
Well, Brutus.

440
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:28,473
- I can't see anything now.
- Don't you like the music?

441
00:48:30,048 --> 00:48:31,811
What you doing?

442
00:48:34,386 --> 00:48:35,978
I can't see.

443
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:26,568
I don't want to be dead.

444
00:49:32,244 --> 00:49:34,269
Jump! Go on! Jump!

445
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:37,873
Save Miette!

446
00:49:37,949 --> 00:49:39,541
Hurry! Jump!

447
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,636
Found, West Pier,
eve of St. John.

448
00:51:31,229 --> 00:51:33,459
Oh, it's a miracle!

449
00:51:33,531 --> 00:51:35,396
She's come to.

450
00:51:36,901 --> 00:51:38,664
Spit!

451
00:51:40,572 --> 00:51:43,336
Feel better? Look at me.

452
00:51:43,408 --> 00:51:45,171
Are you all right?

453
00:51:45,243 --> 00:51:48,007
You're very lucky that I came by.

454
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,142
Haven't I seen you somewhere?

455
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:54,843
I doubt it.

456
00:51:56,254 --> 00:51:58,017
No one ever sees me.

457
00:51:59,391 --> 00:52:01,325
I'm always underwater.

458
00:52:01,393 --> 00:52:03,088
Why?

459
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,755
It's dangerous up there.

460
00:52:07,198 --> 00:52:09,359
- He wants to kill me.
- Who?

461
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:15,005
I can't remember anything.

462
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:18,701
Some people lose their marbles.

463
00:52:18,777 --> 00:52:20,870
And me, I've lost my memory.

464
00:52:20,945 --> 00:52:22,845
I'm glad you're here.

465
00:52:22,914 --> 00:52:25,849
I bring in more than enough stuff
for two.

466
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:28,809
Look.

467
00:52:30,822 --> 00:52:33,222
You see, I'm a treasure hunter.

468
00:52:34,959 --> 00:52:37,052
The city's history is here.

469
00:52:37,128 --> 00:52:39,619
Cast into the sea
and forgotten forever.

470
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:43,065
- I see.
- I'm here, cataloging, dating.

471
00:52:43,134 --> 00:52:45,728
Wait. That's the land shark's safe.

472
00:52:45,804 --> 00:52:49,035
Oh, yes.
Yes, I brought it in yesterday.

473
00:52:49,107 --> 00:52:51,041
And this is Vito Nine Fingers.

474
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:53,475
Everyone thought he ran away
with his money.

475
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:56,742
They're wrong.
What are you doing?

476
00:52:56,815 --> 00:52:59,648
I stole them.
I'm taking back what's mine.

477
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,278
Don't go back up there.

478
00:53:02,353 --> 00:53:04,719
It's dangerous!

479
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:07,223
You're a kid.
Stay with me.

480
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,323
Well, thanks for everything,
but I've got to go.

481
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,160
Not that way.

482
00:53:20,505 --> 00:53:23,065
- The children.
- What about them? What do you know?

483
00:53:23,141 --> 00:53:26,941
He takes them.
The devil takes them away...

484
00:53:27,011 --> 00:53:28,603
in his boat.

485
00:53:30,014 --> 00:53:31,914
He takes them to hell.

486
00:53:31,983 --> 00:53:35,180
- What hell?
- The Tattooed Man, he knows where.

487
00:53:36,821 --> 00:53:39,289
The map.

488
00:53:39,357 --> 00:53:42,952
The map of the minefield
is tattooed on his body.

489
00:53:45,497 --> 00:53:47,260
It's all my fault.

490
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,427
This man's a proper nutcase.

491
00:54:03,948 --> 00:54:06,439
Holy cow, it's little brother again.

492
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,213
Miette.

493
00:54:16,494 --> 00:54:18,758
Take care of him.
He's hopeless.

494
00:54:20,198 --> 00:54:21,756
Sure.

495
00:54:24,569 --> 00:54:26,503
What's the trouble, handsome?

496
00:54:28,173 --> 00:54:30,607
There's no reason to be depressed.
