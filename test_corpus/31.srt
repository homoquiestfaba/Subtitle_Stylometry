1
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:28,849
I can't hold her much longer.
She's taking on too much water.

2
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:33,346
- What is going on back there?
- Keep your pants on, Murphy.

3
00:05:37,862 --> 00:05:41,696
We blew the starboard engine.
Port engine's way too hot.

4
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,891
- Hold on.
- Shorten the tow or cut her loose.

5
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:46,058
Epps...

6
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:50,139
...get off my damn tugboat.
We don't have much time.

7
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:54,505
Move it, Epps. If she sinks,
she's taking us with her.

8
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,787
Got a punch in the port floater.

9
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:06,923
- Five minutes before she floods.
- Less than that!

10
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:09,649
Get back here.
We're cutting her loose.

11
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,387
- Cut her loose.
- That's it. Get back here.

12
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:14,359
Come on! You heard the man!

13
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:19,401
Took us three months to get her off
the bottom. I will not lose her now!

14
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:23,673
Goddamn it, Epps!
You can't fix everything!

15
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,274
Christ!

16
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:35,551
- For the last time, get back here!
- She's taking on too much water!

17
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:42,516
Why do you always have to break
my balls? I said get back here!

18
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:51,230
Do you want me to come down there
and kick your ass? Because I'll do it.

19
00:06:56,974 --> 00:07:01,240
Here's to the best damn
salvage crew in the business!

20
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:04,972
- We did it, guys!
- Yeah, look at that!

21
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:07,947
All right. Nice work.

22
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:12,979
- Here's to the fucking sea!
- To the sea.

23
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:19,323
To a job well done.

24
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,426
Mr. Murphy? I'm Jack Ferriman. I was
wondering if I could buy you a drink.

25
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:26,860
He doesn't drink.

26
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:33,304
Could I talk to you alone?

27
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:37,644
You talk to me, you talk to my crew.
That's the way it is.

28
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:44,011
I fly the Arctic Weather Patrol flights
out of Mackenzie Bay.

29
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:49,023
Last month I was out in the middle
of the Strait when I came across this.

30
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,987
Congratulations. You found a boat.

31
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:56,361
In the middle of the ocean,
of all places.

32
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,264
I tried for radio contact
and got nothing...

33
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:03,463
...so I figured she had to be adrift.

34
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:05,198
In the Bering Strait?

35
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:08,845
That's miles from shipping lanes.
Did you alert the Coast Guard?

36
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:13,006
It's international waters,
so they noted it and that's it.

37
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:14,650
You get a name?

38
00:08:14,818 --> 00:08:19,255
No, I put it out of my head until
two days ago when I saw it again.

39
00:08:19,423 --> 00:08:22,790
What are we talking about?
What kind of tonnage?

40
00:08:22,993 --> 00:08:27,123
Big. Huge.
Could be military.

41
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,995
Let's say that we're
a little bit interested.

42
00:08:31,202 --> 00:08:33,136
What's in it for you?

43
00:08:33,704 --> 00:08:37,196
I want 20% finder's fee,
whatever she's worth.

44
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:42,009
- Have you told anyone else about this?
- Not a living soul.

45
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:48,244
- Give us a minute, will you?
- Okay.

46
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:52,021
So? What do you think, Murph?

47
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:54,719
Who knows? Could be full of shit.

48
00:08:55,593 --> 00:08:59,859
I do know one thing. I've seen strange
things happen in the Strait.

49
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,160
I know something else:
Sea gives you an opportunity, take it.

50
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:09,398
That's at least a week out of our way.
We've been out for six months already.

51
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:13,942
I got a fiancée waiting, remember?
I'm getting married in a month.

52
00:09:14,111 --> 00:09:18,309
Plan was to go back to Anchorage.
Starboard diesel needs an overhaul.

53
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:22,919
- In our business, the only plan is:
- There is no plan.

54
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:28,184
If you don't want to go, that's fine.
Let's tell him we'll get somebody else.

55
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:34,058
Wait a minute. Let's not be hasty.
What's a ship like that worth?

56
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:35,925
Who knows?

57
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,696
Millions? Thousands? Could be nothing.
Depends on a lot of things.

58
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:44,738
- Mainly, if we have the right to salvage.
- Pretty big "if."

59
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:48,708
- What's the split?
- We split it even, six ways.

60
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:52,439
- Even split?
- Beats me paying you overtime.

61
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,379
I'm good.

62
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:57,209
I'm in.

63
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:01,723
Greer? What do you say?

64
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,490
All right.

65
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,731
Hey, Ferriman! Can you come over here?

66
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:16,605
So this is the way it works.
10% instead of your 20% finder's fee.

67
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:24,573
I can't let you take advantage of me
like that.

68
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:27,546
That's the way it is.
Take it or leave it.

69
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:36,419
Fine. But I go with you.

70
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,029
Not on my boat, you don't.

71
00:10:40,564 --> 00:10:44,694
Think I'd tell you where a fortune
might be without insurance?

72
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:47,962
There are five other boats
that would jump at this.

73
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:51,464
I come with you.
So you take it or leave it.

74
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:24,998
Things are dull!

75
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:31,506
She'll love it. What do you think?

76
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:36,509
Too much off the sides, but I can
come up with something she'll love.

77
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:39,884
- Shave that yourself.
- Don't want to help me out?

78
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:45,153
Who the fuck are you kidding? Everybody
knows you Navy boys take it up the ass.

79
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:07,675
- Enjoying the ride, Jack?
- No, sir.

80
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:25,224
Not the same as flying planes
over ice sheets, is it?

81
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:28,769
- What's the appeal?
- I could ask you the same thing.

82
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:33,534
What's a nice girl doing in a dump
like this instead of raising a family?

83
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:37,407
I own a third of Murphy's operation.
I'm not that nice.

84
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:40,049
And these monkeys are my family.

85
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:43,583
Santos to Murphy. Come in.

86
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:50,421
- Yeah?
- I think you should get up here.

87
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:54,062
- What is it?
- I think you should see this!

88
00:12:56,767 --> 00:13:00,259
It was there a second ago!
Ten miles to the northwest.

89
00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:03,429
Would you turn off that fucking music?

90
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:07,902
I'm telling you, there must be a glitch.
I saw it with my own eyes.

91
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:11,842
- Glitch, my ass. There's nothing there.
- Give me a look at this.

92
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:18,253
There it is! Right in front of you!
Tell me you don't see nothing.

93
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,717
Do you see what I'm saying?
Do you see what I'm saying to you?

94
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:29,955
- Dodge, could you get on the bow light?
- All right, Murph.

95
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:37,800
- It's there, right?
- There's something there.

96
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:47,946
Hey, Murph, what's up?

97
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:53,315
Vessel at position 7-5 north...

98
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,715
...this is Arctic Warrior.

99
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,994
Come in.

100
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,160
This is tugboat Arctic Warrior.
Do you read me?

101
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:07,570
This is Arctic Warrior.

102
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:09,999
Do you read me? Come in.

103
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:31,922
Shit!

104
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:02,254
- Now do you believe me?
- Holy shit!

105
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,687
An ocean liner?
Where did that come from?

106
00:15:15,138 --> 00:15:18,107
It's the Antonia Graza.

107
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:20,806
Jesus Christ.

108
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:26,005
This is civilian tugboat Arctic Warrior.
Is there anyone aboard?

109
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:29,914
This is civilian tugboat Arctic Warrior.
Is there anyone aboard?

110
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:34,118
This is Arctic Warrior.
Can you read us?

111
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:40,821
- You know her, Murphy?
- Only in my dreams.

112
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:50,696
Christ, she's beautiful.

113
00:15:51,642 --> 00:15:57,842
Italian liners couldn't compete for speed,
so they built floating art palaces instead.

114
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:03,319
She was reported missing May 21,
1962, off the coast of Labrador.

115
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:08,583
Funny thing is, there was no distress
signal. She just disappeared.

116
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,757
Ever since, every captain's been looking
for her, hoping she hasn't gone down.

117
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,569
- Do you know what this means?
- What?

118
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:24,867
Under the law of the sea, she's ours.
Let's not keep a lady waiting.

119
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:29,636
Santos, bring us alongside. Fire up
the crane. We got business to do.

120
00:16:30,414 --> 00:16:36,046
When we get onboard, stay together. We
don't know what kind of shape she's in.

121
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:39,313
- Take us up, Greer.
- Aye, aye, captain.

122
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:45,025
Hey, Murphy, please remember to keep
all channels open. Thank you.

123
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,199
They won't let me go.

124
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:55,429
Safety first.
That's why you go last, Jack.

125
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:58,572
Can you sit down?
I'm trying to keep this steady.

126
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:01,903
- I just want...
- Sit down! Get out of the way!

127
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:03,340
Okay.

128
00:17:06,783 --> 00:17:10,719
She's had some battering over
the last 40 years, you can tell.

129
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:13,185
Stand by. Setting you down topside.

130
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:18,087
She's still a beaut.

131
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:21,256
Unbelievable.

132
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:24,930
You better stay alert. Watch your step.

133
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:28,469
40 years of rust can turn
deck plates into quicksand.

134
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:33,541
We'll make our way in at the fore,
then check the bridge. This way. Careful.

135
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:37,908
- Forward mast is history.
- Epps and Murphy, are they a couple?

136
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,952
Hell, no. She's like a daughter to him.
He'd be lost without her.

137
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:48,217
Superstructure's in decent shape.
No sign of damage.

138
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:54,756
- Lifeboats are gone, stern to bow.
- Life preserver lockers are all empty.

139
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:58,394
Sure no survivors ever
turned up, Murph?

140
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:01,833
Sure as we're walking on
the Graza, Dodge. This way.

141
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,050
Let's go.

142
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:30,223
Jesus. She's no fiddler's green.

143
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,498
You're wrong, Munder. She's beautiful.

144
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:37,235
Whoever was on here originally
sure left in a hurry.

145
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,566
Murphy, come in.

146
00:18:56,259 --> 00:19:00,320
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard. I'm Julie.

147
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,465
I'll be your hostess this evening.

148
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:09,500
Have some respect, okay?

149
00:19:18,114 --> 00:19:20,878
Check out all those champagne bottles.

150
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:23,815
Looks like we missed
one hell of a party.

151
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:26,615
- And one hell of a hangover.
- Shut up!

152
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:57,619
- Shut up!
- Let's find the bridge.

153
00:19:57,787 --> 00:20:00,984
- Such a manly man.
- What?

154
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:03,450
- You all right?
- Shut up!

155
00:20:03,627 --> 00:20:06,187
Come on, Mary, let's go.

156
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:14,729
Murph, how many passengers
did she carry?

157
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:19,569
Over 600. The créme de la créme
of society from all over Europe.

158
00:20:19,743 --> 00:20:21,540
Crew of 500 from Italy.

159
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:24,339
Talk to me. How's everything going?

160
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:35,185
Okay, good. This companionway
should get us to the bridge.

161
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:38,127
Here, Epps, hold this.

162
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:58,643
What's going on?

163
00:20:59,482 --> 00:21:02,315
- After you.
- No, after you.

164
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:05,545
No, no. After me.

165
00:21:06,022 --> 00:21:07,580
Tough guy.

166
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:24,268
Don't let go!

167
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:28,138
- Pull! Pull!
- Please, Epps!

168
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,674
Please, Epps, don't let go!

169
00:21:33,883 --> 00:21:36,443
- Give me your hand.
- Pull us up!

170
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,749
Oh, God!

171
00:21:47,197 --> 00:21:50,223
I told you to watch your fucking step!

172
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:57,297
- Oh, shit. Oh, Jesus.
- From now on, you let me lead. Okay?

173
00:21:57,474 --> 00:21:58,532
Let's go.

174
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:04,209
- I think I just shit my pants.
- No, you always smell that way.

175
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:53,858
Compass is dead.

176
00:22:59,436 --> 00:23:01,165
Helm's not responding, either.

177
00:23:01,704 --> 00:23:07,074
Fuel tanks are empty. She must've rode
on full throttle till she was bone-dry.

178
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:11,938
Epps!

179
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,180
I'm looking for the ship's log.
Let's get this documentation back...

180
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:25,056
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

181
00:23:25,628 --> 00:23:28,290
- You sure?
- Yeah.

182
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:30,891
Let's get to it.

183
00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:37,401
Hey, check this out.

184
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:44,711
- It's a watch. Congratulations, buddy.
- No. Look again, you moron.

185
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:50,352
It's a digital watch. Do the math. They
didn't have digital watches in 1962.

186
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,321
So we're not the first people to board
this ship. But she's ours now.

187
00:23:55,492 --> 00:24:01,522
Let's get some sleep, tow her at dawn.
Let's hope there's no more surprises.

188
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:02,756
Amen to that.

189
00:24:08,104 --> 00:24:10,265
Oh, God.

190
00:24:15,044 --> 00:24:18,639
Epps, can I get some tea?

191
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:25,453
Any sign of what might've happened?
How she got here?

192
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:28,856
That's the $64 million question,
isn't it?

193
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:32,027
Ever hear of a ship called
the Marie Celeste?

194
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:36,689
Twin-masted brigantine out of
Charleston during the Civil War.

195
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,565
She was bound for London
with a cargo of cotton.

196
00:24:40,837 --> 00:24:41,826
Thanks.

197
00:24:43,306 --> 00:24:47,766
Two months after she set sail, she was
sighted by fishermen off Tripoli.

198
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:51,208
She was doing 12 knots an hour
in a stiff breeze.

199
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:57,887
Something wasn't quite right. They
didn't know what so they went onboard.

200
00:24:58,655 --> 00:25:00,850
You know what they found?

201
00:25:03,993 --> 00:25:05,290
Nothing.

202
00:25:05,828 --> 00:25:09,389
No passengers. No crew. No captain.

203
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,194
No sign of distress.

204
00:25:12,936 --> 00:25:19,239
59 days after the last log entry, it had
traveled 4500 miles across the ocean...

205
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:25,541
...past the Rock of Gibraltar and into
the Mediterranean Sea at full sail.

206
00:25:27,116 --> 00:25:28,981
And nobody at the helm.

207
00:25:29,752 --> 00:25:32,482
- What do you make of that?
- A ghost ship.

208
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:38,656
Hey, you smell that?
I smell bullshit.

209
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,800
- Been on the sea a lot longer than you.
- I know.

210
00:25:44,968 --> 00:25:48,870
Seen things that
you can't even imagine.

211
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:54,574
Maritime history is full of
Marie Celestes.

212
00:25:54,744 --> 00:25:57,372
So, what's our plan?

213
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,380
I think we should do what we came
to do. Tie her up, tug her in.

214
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:05,783
You think our little tug
will pull this entire ocean liner?

215
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:09,248
Not with the problems we got.

216
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:13,623
We could set her at anchor
and come back with two or three tugs.

217
00:26:13,796 --> 00:26:16,424
No, some Russian trawler
will come along.

218
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:20,626
I've already looked for her anchors,
anyway. They're gone.

219
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:23,772
- What do you think?
- Get the engines working...

220
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:28,137
...it could take us two weeks
minimum to tow a vessel this size.

221
00:26:28,344 --> 00:26:32,644
For my share of what she's worth,
I'd drag her back to Anchorage myself.

222
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:46,158
Don't let go!

223
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:51,095
Help me! Don't let go!

224
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:57,101
- Thought you might want a jacket.
- Thanks.

225
00:27:09,052 --> 00:27:10,485
Boy, do I miss that.

226
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:14,646
You okay? You seem quiet
since you came back.

227
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:21,386
I think I saw something
I couldn't possibly have seen.

228
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:24,497
- Like what?
- No, it's crazy.

229
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:26,896
I'm curious. Tell me.

230
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:35,336
I think I saw a little girl.

231
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:37,775
On...

232
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,177
On the... The boat?

233
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:45,114
Yeah. Looking right at me.

234
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,515
And then what happened?

235
00:27:48,691 --> 00:27:51,285
Nothing. She disappeared.

236
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:56,023
Sometimes, when I'd be flying
for hours on end...

237
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:59,430
...I'd think I'd see stuff too.

238
00:27:59,736 --> 00:28:04,002
It'd be there one second
and gone the next. Like a dream.

239
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:09,010
Thanks.

240
00:28:09,345 --> 00:28:11,745
- See you in the a.m.
- Okay.

241
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:14,674
Good night.

242
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,553
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

243
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:45,910
She's got a big hole.
She's sinking.

244
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:52,988
- This is where the damage is. See?
- Breach in the hull, about 10 by 20...

245
00:28:53,156 --> 00:28:57,616
...torn to the port collision bulkhead.
- Did it hit an iceberg?

246
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:01,785
No, you don't need an iceberg
to rupture a hull.

247
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:05,789
- She's been hit recently.
- About a week ago, I'd say.

248
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:07,526
This is where we are.

249
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:11,366
The problem's this group of islands.
Nothing spectacular...

250
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,907
...just rocks,
a couple thousand seals.

251
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:17,944
The Antonia Graza's caught here
in this strong current loop...

252
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:22,584
...and slowly she's been pushed towards
those rocks. Last time she hit them.

253
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:25,345
- What about next time?
- Won't be one.

254
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:29,321
We've got three days to fix it.
That's if the weather holds.

255
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:31,627
Why can't we tow it like it is?

256
00:29:31,794 --> 00:29:34,922
It'd be like towing a car
with four flat tires.

257
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:40,467
- It's a bump in the road. We can fix it.
- Murph, bump in the road?

258
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,837
The breach we can probably patch
if we can get to the inside.

259
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:51,836
We'll weld shut the flooded compartments,
pump out the water up to the aft peak.

260
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:54,949
On top of that, the rudder's jammed.

261
00:29:55,117 --> 00:29:59,816
We jerry-rig it, set a 38-degree
current drift to clear the island chain.

262
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:02,890
What does all that mean?

263
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,256
I just... That's a lot
of work for three days.

264
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:10,832
But with the gear we've got onboard
and what's on that ship, we can try.

265
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,433
We can do it, right?

266
00:30:13,503 --> 00:30:17,234
With the gear we've got onboard,
I can't fix our engine.

267
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,568
Quit bitching and overhaul
the starboard engine.

268
00:30:20,743 --> 00:30:23,211
- So that's the plan?
- Just do it.

269
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:31,618
- I'll call it in.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

270
00:30:31,787 --> 00:30:34,255
- Maritime law states...
- I know.

271
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:40,328
We just don't want any
unexpected guests. Just leave it.

272
00:30:40,897 --> 00:30:41,955
Your call, captain.

273
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:50,294
All right, you know the drill.
We do a complete recon.

274
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,965
Make sure we've got no problems
before we get to work.

275
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,873
- Stay with me, Greer. Don't wander.
- Okay.

276
00:30:57,046 --> 00:30:59,606
Dodge, Munder, go to the port
collision bulkhead.

277
00:30:59,782 --> 00:31:03,445
Jack and I'll work back from the fore.
Call if you need anything.

278
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:07,020
- How about a pizza?
- You're so funny.

279
00:31:07,223 --> 00:31:11,990
The only plan in this business is that
there is no plan. What is that?

280
00:31:12,194 --> 00:31:17,689
What these people talking crazy for?
That's not even good English.

281
00:31:19,435 --> 00:31:21,232
Hang in there, okay, preciosa?

282
00:31:21,404 --> 00:31:25,101
Because someday he'll find
some other genius to fix his boat.

283
00:31:28,978 --> 00:31:30,741
You want to play like that?

284
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:35,175
It's still sweet, though.

285
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,846
Light coming up.

286
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:48,528
You were right. She is beautiful.

287
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,790
She sure is.

288
00:32:29,672 --> 00:32:35,133
Epps, we're heading for
the main engine room. Epps?

289
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:02,036
All right, capitano.

290
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,464
Oh, shit.

291
00:35:10,633 --> 00:35:13,898
We're gonna have to dive
to get to that tear.

292
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:18,371
Epps, the engine room
is totally flooded.

293
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:22,373
Epps, can you hear me?

294
00:35:29,285 --> 00:35:30,445
Wait!

295
00:35:32,855 --> 00:35:35,688
What happened? You okay?

296
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:39,622
What are you doing down there?
Did you hurt yourself?

297
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:19,133
What are you doing?

298
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:25,965
The whole bottom's riddled with them.

299
00:36:26,275 --> 00:36:28,573
Looks like someone
used it for target practice.

300
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:32,470
- That's the happy version.
- What's the not-so-happy version?

301
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:35,241
There were people in there.

302
00:36:35,517 --> 00:36:37,576
I saw that little girl again.

303
00:36:37,753 --> 00:36:40,745
What? Where?

304
00:36:41,924 --> 00:36:46,088
- I must be losing my goddamn mind.
- Well, did she say anything?

305
00:36:46,262 --> 00:36:48,924
Forget it. Come on.

306
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:17,558
Murphy, come in.

307
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:20,852
Dodge! Anybody!

308
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:23,220
Shit.

309
00:37:27,303 --> 00:37:29,635
I think she's fucking with us.

310
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,346
Looks like central laundry.

311
00:38:21,357 --> 00:38:26,192
This vent connects to the forward hold.
We need to see if it's flooded.

312
00:38:26,395 --> 00:38:29,831
- I may need help shutting it.
- You sure we need to...?

313
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,150
Murphy, where the hell are you?

314
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:53,887
- How long have they been here?
- A month, maybe less.

315
00:38:54,089 --> 00:38:57,252
- What are we gonna do?
- Get off this boat!

316
00:38:57,426 --> 00:38:59,860
- But the ship...
- Lf it sinks, it sinks.

317
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:02,054
You're right.

318
00:39:02,264 --> 00:39:04,357
Stinks.

319
00:39:06,201 --> 00:39:08,601
- What the hell?
- We came through there.

320
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:10,500
No shit!

321
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:16,234
Come on!

322
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:22,178
This way. Come on, Jack.

323
00:39:39,034 --> 00:39:40,399
What the...?

324
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:50,745
When'd you start
wearing lipstick, Epps?

325
00:39:51,447 --> 00:39:53,176
Epps?

326
00:39:56,718 --> 00:39:59,050
"Francesca."

327
00:39:59,655 --> 00:40:01,213
Nice titties.

328
00:40:02,157 --> 00:40:07,390
Not that you can hold a candle
to the future Mrs. Greer, though.

329
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:25,377
Come on, Jack. Stop dragging ass!
What's your problem?

330
00:40:30,786 --> 00:40:32,447
What's this?

331
00:40:32,754 --> 00:40:35,985
Forget it. Let's go! Jack!

332
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:41,394
'58 Jaguar X150. I've dreamt
about this car since I was a kid.

333
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:45,897
We have to get out of here now.
Do you understand? Now.

334
00:40:52,808 --> 00:40:56,107
There's something moving in there.

335
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:14,255
Fuck!

336
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,090
Oh, my God!
I hate rats!

337
00:41:19,735 --> 00:41:21,362
What?

338
00:41:22,171 --> 00:41:24,605
Oh, my God! Look at this!

339
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:27,008
I have to get Murphy.

340
00:41:27,442 --> 00:41:28,932
Murphy!

341
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,775
Is someone trying to call me?

342
00:41:37,986 --> 00:41:40,216
Dodge! Munder!

343
00:41:40,923 --> 00:41:43,118
Maureen...

344
00:41:43,692 --> 00:41:45,853
Who's Maureen?

345
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:48,292
It's my first name.

346
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,533
- It's cold...
- He said "cold"?

347
00:41:53,702 --> 00:41:55,636
The galley.

348
00:42:04,613 --> 00:42:08,140
- It's cold.
- Please help us.

349
00:42:13,522 --> 00:42:15,547
Don't go in there.

350
00:42:53,762 --> 00:42:57,027
You fucking assholes!
Fuck you!

351
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,000
Take it easy!

352
00:43:00,168 --> 00:43:04,468
You were fucking with us. We fucked
with you. Why aren't you laughing?

353
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,077
Wanna hear something funnier? We
found dead guys in the laundry room.

354
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:13,040
And this in the cargo hold.

355
00:43:25,827 --> 00:43:27,385
Need some help, skipper?

356
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,292
I'm sorry.

357
00:43:51,153 --> 00:43:52,848
- Jesus.
- Oh, man.

358
00:43:53,055 --> 00:43:55,114
Holy shit!

359
00:43:59,628 --> 00:44:01,095
Yeah!

360
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:03,958
We're rich!

361
00:44:05,334 --> 00:44:08,326
- You son of a bitch!
- Rich!

362
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:15,038
- Come on. Let's go.
- Move this shit out!

363
00:44:15,911 --> 00:44:18,106
One. Two. Three...

364
00:44:35,664 --> 00:44:38,292
How much you figure it's worth, boss?

365
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:43,632
There's a lot of gold. Hard to know.
Two, 300 million, maybe. Maybe more.

366
00:44:43,805 --> 00:44:45,568
- Jesus.
- I don't know.

367
00:44:45,774 --> 00:44:49,141
Lock boxes with half of Fort Knox
in them? They gotta be insured.

368
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:52,802
No way somebody will let
this much gold float away.

369
00:44:53,014 --> 00:44:56,142
Well, the markings have been
filed down.

370
00:44:56,651 --> 00:45:00,747
- What does that mean?
- Someone didn't want this traceable.

371
00:45:01,923 --> 00:45:02,981
It's stolen.

372
00:45:03,191 --> 00:45:07,924
It may have to do with the reason
this ship disappeared when it did.

373
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:11,497
Wait. If the gold's got
something to do with 1962...

374
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,864
...what about the bodies? They can't be
more than three weeks old.

375
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:21,173
Somebody's gotta say it, and it might as
well be me. This ship is fucked up.

376
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:26,576
Earlier I could swear I heard
a woman singing. It's like she was...

377
00:45:26,782 --> 00:45:29,376
- Like she was coming on to me.
- Oh, no!

378
00:45:33,855 --> 00:45:36,847
It was the sexiest voice
I ever heard, man.

379
00:45:37,058 --> 00:45:43,293
- She got any backup singers?
- Whatever you're on, get me some!

380
00:45:43,498 --> 00:45:47,525
Maybe you're not quite
ready to get married, Greer.

381
00:45:47,702 --> 00:45:49,101
- Fuck you.
- Okay, guys.

382
00:45:49,604 --> 00:45:52,300
- What about the Coast Guard?
- No.

383
00:45:52,507 --> 00:45:57,103
You call the Coast Guard... What if
the gold did turn out to be stolen?

384
00:45:59,781 --> 00:46:03,717
Under maritime law, anything
found in international waters...

385
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:07,548
...belongs to the finder. Okay?
That is the law.

386
00:46:07,756 --> 00:46:10,384
- Right.
- Finders keepers.

387
00:46:10,592 --> 00:46:13,459
If we're gonna do this,
I say we do it now.

388
00:46:13,662 --> 00:46:17,928
Get our boat going, grab the gold
and get the hell out of here.

389
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:21,125
We leave the boat, take the gold.
Who's with me?

390
00:46:21,703 --> 00:46:24,228
I'm with the gold, man.

391
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,839
Gold.

392
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:29,272
The gold.

393
00:46:32,981 --> 00:46:35,848
- Epps?
- I just want to get off this boat.

394
00:46:36,384 --> 00:46:38,249
Okay. Let's go to work.

395
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:45,025
Okay. Warrior is in position, Murph.
Can we please get the hell out of here?

396
00:46:46,628 --> 00:46:51,565
Yeah, preciosa! Smell that money!
100 million. You hear what I'm saying?

397
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:53,462
100 million!

398
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,697
Greer? Get those engines going.

399
00:46:57,906 --> 00:46:59,771
I'm bringing the gold down.

400
00:46:59,941 --> 00:47:01,636
Yes, sir, captain, sir.

401
00:47:02,511 --> 00:47:06,845
Hey, Santos. Hurry your ass up, vato.
We got to go like this.

402
00:47:07,983 --> 00:47:12,420
I wanna see these gauges rocking,
because you just had an overhaul.

403
00:47:13,755 --> 00:47:16,451
And you, I want you
to give me some too.

404
00:47:21,096 --> 00:47:23,326
Let's do this!

405
00:47:24,065 --> 00:47:26,363
Hey, yo, Greer! Fire it up!

406
00:47:26,568 --> 00:47:30,504
We're going to haul ass.
Bring it on! We'll be so fucking rich!

407
00:47:31,706 --> 00:47:33,571
Stop!

408
00:47:33,909 --> 00:47:36,275
Stop! You don't know
what you're doing!

409
00:47:37,379 --> 00:47:39,040
We're good to go, skipper.

410
00:47:43,018 --> 00:47:45,043
Don't start the boats! He'II...

411
00:47:46,621 --> 00:47:47,918
Shit!

412
00:47:48,623 --> 00:47:50,147
Greer!

413
00:47:53,528 --> 00:47:55,689
Greer! What the hell just happened?

414
00:47:56,865 --> 00:47:59,766
Jesus Christ! Fire on deck!

415
00:48:10,078 --> 00:48:13,445
Santos! Greer! Munder!

416
00:48:30,098 --> 00:48:31,725
I got you.

417
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:35,994
- Epps! I got Munder!
- Greer!

418
00:48:37,672 --> 00:48:39,401
Come on!

419
00:48:40,342 --> 00:48:44,438
Santos!
Santos, answer me!

420
00:49:05,266 --> 00:49:10,966
I don't know what happened.
The engine room just blew.

421
00:49:11,306 --> 00:49:15,242
Maybe Santos rushed the engines,
didn't seal up the gaskets right...

422
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:19,947
Jack, did you find anything out about
this ship before you sent us out here?

423
00:49:20,615 --> 00:49:24,574
No, but I... Look, we've got
the gold, and we are still alive.

424
00:49:24,786 --> 00:49:27,516
- Tell that to Santos, asshole!
- Ease up!

425
00:49:27,689 --> 00:49:29,486
This is bullshit!

426
00:49:29,691 --> 00:49:31,852
Santos came here out of free will...

427
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,927
...just like us.
- What does that mean?

428
00:49:35,096 --> 00:49:37,291
- Enough!
- Santos is dead because of you!

429
00:49:37,499 --> 00:49:40,195
Come on! It's not gonna
bring him back.

430
00:49:59,954 --> 00:50:03,117
Murph, it's not your fault.
You know that.

431
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,170
How is he?

432
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:24,001
Here's the plan. We're professional
salvors with a fortune onboard.

433
00:50:24,279 --> 00:50:27,544
I say we do what we do best:
fix this rust bucket.

434
00:50:27,716 --> 00:50:30,276
Control her drift. Clear those islands.

435
00:50:30,452 --> 00:50:32,977
We can survive long enough
to get picked up.

436
00:50:33,188 --> 00:50:36,248
Why is this a question?
We have the materials.

437
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:42,021
Why don't we build a raft and leave?
There is something wrong with this boat!

438
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,722
- Lf we stay here, we may not survive.
- You want to build a raft?

439
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,528
- I want to build a raft.
- Even with the Warrior...

440
00:50:48,737 --> 00:50:52,969
...we were stretching to do this
in three days. We can't do this.

441
00:50:53,141 --> 00:50:55,609
You're the best spot-welder I know.

442
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,744
We can do it right now,
but I need you.

443
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:06,214
Fine. But there's no way we're doing
a major patch-and-pump in the dark.

444
00:51:06,387 --> 00:51:08,855
Even with the lights we have,
it'd be like going in blind.

445
00:51:09,023 --> 00:51:12,550
Okay, fine. We'll chill tonight
and go in the a.m.

446
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:18,228
Greer? What do you say?

447
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:22,335
Now you want to know what
the first mate has to say?

448
00:51:22,503 --> 00:51:26,803
I say go to hell, Epps. You're not
qualified to get us off this ship.

449
00:51:26,974 --> 00:51:30,205
Had Murphy let me do it my way,
we wouldn't be in this.

450
00:51:30,411 --> 00:51:34,438
- And the Coast Guard...
- So it's everybody else's fault, right?

451
00:51:34,615 --> 00:51:37,880
They'd be here and we'd
be on our way home, millionaires.

452
00:51:38,052 --> 00:51:39,280
That's bullshit.

453
00:51:40,454 --> 00:51:41,887
Grow up, asshole.

454
00:51:43,457 --> 00:51:47,257
Fucking bitch! Keep fucking talking.
Say another word!

455
00:51:47,995 --> 00:51:50,190
Say another word!

456
00:52:40,514 --> 00:52:43,415
Here it is. Katie. B-deck.

457
00:52:43,584 --> 00:52:44,983
You were alone.

458
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,855
100-to- 1, somebody poisoned
the passengers to get the gold.

459
00:52:53,027 --> 00:52:56,861
Okay, Sherlock, if they were poisoned,
why are these cans safe?

460
00:52:57,031 --> 00:53:01,024
They're still sealed.
It's been sealed for 40 years. It's safe.

461
00:53:01,201 --> 00:53:04,398
Okay, shoot for it. Loser goes first.

462
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:09,376
- Paper beats rock.
- Come on, man, best of three.

463
00:53:09,643 --> 00:53:12,703
- Bullshit. You lost.
- Where's your empathy?

464
00:53:12,913 --> 00:53:17,316
Winners do not empathize
with losers. Bon appétit.

465
00:53:27,061 --> 00:53:28,585
I screwed up.

466
00:53:29,363 --> 00:53:31,058
I should've called it in.

467
00:53:31,532 --> 00:53:34,626
Damn! I knew better!

468
00:53:35,969 --> 00:53:38,995
I'll make it home to you, baby.
I swear.

469
00:53:41,642 --> 00:53:43,667
What the hell are you looking at?

470
00:53:53,353 --> 00:53:55,184
- That's all right.
- No way.

471
00:53:55,355 --> 00:53:58,586
No, really. It's good.
Look, I'm not kidding.

472
00:53:58,826 --> 00:54:01,920
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious. It's good!

473
00:54:05,299 --> 00:54:07,733
- You gotta try that!
- That's good!

474
00:54:07,935 --> 00:54:08,959
That's great!

475
00:54:10,337 --> 00:54:11,964
Katie?

476
00:54:19,146 --> 00:54:21,137
Katie?

477
00:54:41,468 --> 00:54:43,663
Can I tell you something else?
We get back...

478
00:54:43,871 --> 00:54:48,467
...I'm gonna take my money
and I'm gonna buy you a bathtub.

479
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:53,669
I'll get you a lifetime supply
of titty magazines and toilet paper!

480
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:56,672
I already beat you to it, bro!

481
00:55:02,022 --> 00:55:03,649
There's something on your...

482
00:55:22,676 --> 00:55:24,576
Katie?

483
00:58:29,363 --> 00:58:31,160
Who, me?

484
00:58:36,703 --> 00:58:39,331
Francesca, I know
all of this isn't real.

485
00:58:40,807 --> 00:58:43,901
So I'm just gonna go with it, okay?

486
00:58:47,014 --> 00:58:50,347
Can't cheat on your fiancée
with a dead girl, right?

487
00:59:18,245 --> 00:59:20,611
Her parents.

488
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:25,282
Please.

489
00:59:27,287 --> 00:59:29,653
Don't close it.

490
00:59:32,959 --> 00:59:35,757
Haven't seen them for years.

491
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:39,021
They moved to New York.

492
00:59:39,966 --> 00:59:42,696
I was on my way to join them.

493
00:59:44,538 --> 00:59:45,971
But they're dead now.

494
00:59:48,275 --> 00:59:50,937
- How would you know?
- When you're like this...

495
00:59:51,144 --> 00:59:52,975
...you know these things.

496
00:59:54,848 --> 00:59:56,475
My mother...

497
00:59:58,085 --> 01:00:01,282
...she made me this dress.

498
01:00:01,488 --> 01:00:02,648
Do you like it?

499
01:00:07,961 --> 01:00:10,088
You remind me of her.

500
01:00:11,698 --> 01:00:13,962
I don't think so.

501
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:20,071
Well, here. You should have this back.

502
01:00:26,813 --> 01:00:30,112
Oh, God, you really are
a fucking ghost.

503
01:00:34,955 --> 01:00:37,082
Where are you going?

504
01:00:50,403 --> 01:00:54,703
Santos was my goddamn responsibility.

505
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:11,953
- The Lorelei.
- She was adrift. We rescued her.

506
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:15,356
I've heard the story of the Lorelei.

507
01:01:16,997 --> 01:01:19,966
I didn't know the Graza was involved.

508
01:01:22,536 --> 01:01:25,004
The gold was onboard the Lorelei?

509
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:31,734
It says here "May 19, 1962."

510
01:01:32,646 --> 01:01:36,173
That's two days before
your ship disappeared.

511
01:01:38,351 --> 01:01:41,946
There were no survivors
onboard the Lorelei.

512
01:01:49,596 --> 01:01:50,893
Jesus Christ!

513
01:01:56,102 --> 01:01:58,161
Where you going?

514
01:02:18,491 --> 01:02:21,688
Most spirits are free
to be with their families.

515
01:02:21,995 --> 01:02:24,862
So why aren't you with yours?

516
01:02:28,268 --> 01:02:31,533
- We're all trapped here.
- Who?

517
01:02:32,906 --> 01:02:35,101
My shipmates and I.

518
01:02:35,742 --> 01:02:38,404
Even the ones who aren't marked.

519
01:02:38,745 --> 01:02:39,973
Marked?

520
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,441
Katie, what do you mean?

521
01:02:42,616 --> 01:02:45,107
When the boat's full...

522
01:02:46,186 --> 01:02:47,881
What? You can tell me.

523
01:02:48,722 --> 01:02:53,625
When he has all the souls he needs
and has filled his quota...

524
01:02:55,562 --> 01:02:58,053
...we'll all be ferried...

525
01:02:58,698 --> 01:03:00,097
...to...

526
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:03,129
What is it? What's wrong?

527
01:03:05,305 --> 01:03:08,604
- What is it?
- He doesn't want me talking to you.

528
01:03:08,808 --> 01:03:11,470
- He who?
- But I'm not like the others!

529
01:03:11,678 --> 01:03:13,305
You need to tell me.

530
01:03:13,513 --> 01:03:17,813
You must go at once.
Leave the ship while you still can!

531
01:03:18,018 --> 01:03:19,849
Katie, what is it?

532
01:03:21,588 --> 01:03:26,491
Katie! Katie?

533
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,093
Epps?

534
01:03:29,062 --> 01:03:30,689
Come on!

535
01:03:31,264 --> 01:03:32,754
We have to leave.

536
01:03:35,568 --> 01:03:37,365
Where you going, Murphy?

537
01:03:40,907 --> 01:03:43,671
What's the matter? It's me.

538
01:03:44,177 --> 01:03:45,303
Santos.

539
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,537
It's no fun lying
at the bottom of the ocean.

540
01:03:53,153 --> 01:03:56,850
No lights at the end of the tunnel.
Not for me, Murph.

541
01:03:58,191 --> 01:04:00,955
No 10,000 virgins at the pearly gates.

542
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:07,698
Because of the plan, I'm trapped
on this dreamboat of yours.

543
01:04:07,934 --> 01:04:12,337
So you know what?
You're coming along for the ride.

544
01:04:34,761 --> 01:04:36,388
No!

545
01:04:44,771 --> 01:04:45,829
Murphy?

546
01:04:57,217 --> 01:04:59,447
You all right, Murph?

547
01:05:01,755 --> 01:05:03,086
You okay?

548
01:05:07,227 --> 01:05:09,457
- What's the matter, Murph?
- It's me!

549
01:05:16,569 --> 01:05:20,562
- It's me!
- Do it, come on. It'll make you feel good.

550
01:05:28,081 --> 01:05:29,070
Come on!

551
01:05:36,189 --> 01:05:38,384
- Come on!
- Hey!

552
01:05:46,065 --> 01:05:49,125
Oh, God.
Epps, you okay?

553
01:05:53,673 --> 01:05:57,302
- Keep him in the aquarium.
- No, listen. He was drunk.

554
01:05:57,477 --> 01:06:00,275
He didn't know what he was doing.

555
01:06:00,447 --> 01:06:04,543
Look, he just tried to kill you.
He stays in there.

556
01:06:05,318 --> 01:06:07,786
Let's go find Greer.

557
01:06:18,965 --> 01:06:21,195
Any sign of him?

558
01:06:21,434 --> 01:06:26,337
No, we looked all over. Man's pissed off.
Seems to happen on this boat.

559
01:06:26,906 --> 01:06:30,307
- Least we weren't around 40 years ago.
- The passengers were poisoned...

560
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:34,606
...to get to the gold? Isn't that...?
- Extreme? Maybe, but if the shoe fits...

561
01:06:34,914 --> 01:06:37,940
Next thing you know,
we'll be trying to kill each other.

562
01:06:38,151 --> 01:06:42,178
- What's with the heart?
- Found it. Belonged to this little girl.

563
01:06:42,355 --> 01:06:45,916
- What girl?
- She told me to get off this boat.

564
01:06:46,092 --> 01:06:49,619
- She's talking to you now?
- What are you talking about?

565
01:06:49,796 --> 01:06:53,163
- You're seeing ghosts, Epps?
- Just forget it.

566
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:55,392
So the ship's got a few kinks.

567
01:06:55,568 --> 01:06:59,629
Let's stick with Munder's specs
and try to fix the ship.

568
01:06:59,806 --> 01:07:03,139
No way five people and the gold
will fit on any raft.

569
01:07:03,309 --> 01:07:06,801
Murphy's not going anywhere,
and we're not leaving him here.

570
01:07:07,013 --> 01:07:11,074
We stick with the plan. Fix the boat.
Let's get going. Come on.

571
01:07:21,594 --> 01:07:24,154
That's the collision bulkhead hatch.

572
01:07:24,497 --> 01:07:28,058
- Wheel's busted. It won't open.
- Arming the C4.

573
01:07:28,268 --> 01:07:29,326
- Dodge?
- I'm good.

574
01:07:29,502 --> 01:07:30,901
- Munder?
- I'm good.

575
01:07:31,104 --> 01:07:33,004
Contact.

576
01:07:37,243 --> 01:07:40,872
- There's the tear, portside.
- Looks bigger from here.

577
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,674
I'll shut her up, no problem.

578
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:51,382
- Munder, rudder's fixed. You all right?
- I'm good.

579
01:07:52,492 --> 01:07:55,723
- What do you think, Dodge?
- She'll hold.

580
01:07:59,065 --> 01:08:02,034
- We're set with the pumps.
- Start them up.

581
01:08:03,336 --> 01:08:06,362
Copy that, Epps.
One and two, kicking in.

582
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:10,168
- I give it 12 hours till she's bone-dry.
- Both on full.

583
01:08:10,343 --> 01:08:13,437
Get ready, Epps. Here it comes.

584
01:08:13,646 --> 01:08:14,977
Great work, guys.

585
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:36,498
Damn. Current's faster than I thought.

586
01:08:38,471 --> 01:08:44,808
If we control her drift, headed in this
direction, we should clear those islands.

587
01:08:44,978 --> 01:08:47,879
We'll keep it afloat
until we get picked up.

588
01:08:48,047 --> 01:08:51,278
Son of a bitch.
We may just get out of this yet.

589
01:08:51,484 --> 01:08:52,678
Kazillionaires.

590
01:08:52,852 --> 01:08:55,650
Check on the bridge
when you're done here.

591
01:08:55,822 --> 01:08:58,347
I'll see if I can find Greer
down below.

592
01:09:02,929 --> 01:09:05,022
Greer?

593
01:09:21,514 --> 01:09:23,209
Katie?

594
01:09:35,728 --> 01:09:37,992
Greer? Jesus!

595
01:09:45,705 --> 01:09:48,367
- Shit.
- Number two's clogged. Who's going?

596
01:09:48,541 --> 01:09:50,566
You go.

597
01:09:52,378 --> 01:09:54,403
Shit. Every single time!

598
01:09:57,583 --> 01:10:00,108
Oh, my God.

599
01:10:00,286 --> 01:10:02,151
Come with me.

600
01:10:03,923 --> 01:10:05,914
I want to show you something.

601
01:14:28,854 --> 01:14:30,446
No!

602
01:14:30,656 --> 01:14:32,817
Come on! No!

603
01:14:33,326 --> 01:14:35,556
Come on!

604
01:14:36,696 --> 01:14:39,995
You can't die on me!

605
01:15:34,253 --> 01:15:37,017
Dodge. Murphy's dead.

606
01:15:37,223 --> 01:15:39,589
- What?
- We have to get off this boat.

607
01:15:39,792 --> 01:15:43,956
There's a reason you, me and Munder are
still alive. That's why he came after us.

608
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:48,089
- To fix his ship.
- I just saw Murphy. What's happening?

609
01:15:51,203 --> 01:15:52,830
I don't know.

610
01:15:55,074 --> 01:15:57,474
I want you and Dodge
on the rudder.

611
01:15:57,643 --> 01:15:59,907
- But you just said...
- Listen to me.

612
01:16:00,413 --> 01:16:06,409
I'll get Munder, we'll see if the welds
are holding. Stay here till we get back.

613
01:16:06,619 --> 01:16:10,111
I do not want you out of
each other's sight. Take this.

614
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:12,724
Take it.

615
01:16:14,727 --> 01:16:17,662
- Be careful down there.
- I will.

616
01:17:12,384 --> 01:17:15,615
- That's it, then. We made it.
- For now.

617
01:17:16,222 --> 01:17:19,282
- I'll check on Epps.
- No, she said to wait here.

618
01:17:19,492 --> 01:17:22,928
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, she said to wait! So wait.

619
01:17:36,742 --> 01:17:38,437
You disgust me.

620
01:17:38,611 --> 01:17:41,409
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

621
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:45,607
You're a pathetic excuse for a man.
She says, "Jump," and you jump.

622
01:17:45,818 --> 01:17:49,015
You're disgusting.
I don't have time for this.

623
01:17:54,927 --> 01:17:59,626
- Who the hell are you?
- The question is, who are you?

624
01:17:59,798 --> 01:18:03,165
You worship her, yet you've
never had the balls to tell her...

625
01:18:03,369 --> 01:18:06,031
...because you're a weak,
cowardly child.

626
01:18:06,605 --> 01:18:12,566
However, if you'll kindly step out of
my way, I'll make your dream a reality.

627
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:17,471
You know, Dodge, if you kill somebody,
you go to hell.

628
01:18:19,885 --> 01:18:23,412
Well, you live for her.
You willing to die for her?

629
01:19:07,633 --> 01:19:11,000
I shot Ferriman. He's dead.

630
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:13,934
Yeah? Don't be so sure, Dodge.

631
01:19:14,139 --> 01:19:17,973
- What are you doing?
- Trip's over. I'm sinking the boat.

632
01:19:18,143 --> 01:19:20,737
- It's taken its last victim.
- That'll kill us.

633
01:19:20,913 --> 01:19:23,609
- We'll have to take our chances.
- What about the gold?

634
01:19:23,816 --> 01:19:28,150
Fucking kidding? We're not getting the
gold off this boat. Nobody ever does.

635
01:19:28,354 --> 01:19:30,254
Wait, wait. Wait!

636
01:19:30,823 --> 01:19:34,554
That gold can give us everything
we ever wanted.

637
01:19:34,727 --> 01:19:38,322
We could have our own boat.
The two of us.

638
01:19:38,497 --> 01:19:41,728
We could have a life together.
You and me.

639
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:46,166
What are you talking about?
Dodge, we gotta get out of here. Now.

640
01:19:46,839 --> 01:19:49,364
Well, I can't let you do that.

641
01:19:57,016 --> 01:19:58,916
So that's it, huh?

642
01:20:00,819 --> 01:20:03,481
All right. Okay.

643
01:20:03,656 --> 01:20:06,022
You win. All right.

644
01:20:08,894 --> 01:20:10,987
Fucking bitch!

645
01:20:11,196 --> 01:20:13,790
All right, you win! Go ahead, do it!

646
01:20:13,999 --> 01:20:16,263
Go ahead. Blow it up!

647
01:20:16,468 --> 01:20:17,867
Kill us all!

648
01:20:20,472 --> 01:20:25,136
Hey, Dodge. Why haven't you
asked me where Munder is?

649
01:20:32,318 --> 01:20:35,287
Well, I suppose that's because...

650
01:20:36,689 --> 01:20:38,350
...I already know.

651
01:20:38,891 --> 01:20:42,224
- You won't pull that trigger, Maureen.
- Try me.

652
01:20:42,728 --> 01:20:45,959
Dodge made the same mistake.
He's dead.

653
01:20:48,033 --> 01:20:49,830
Katie told you, didn't she?

654
01:20:50,002 --> 01:20:54,234
Souls without sin can't be marked.
Makes them tough to control.

655
01:20:54,406 --> 01:20:57,807
But as long as I keep the boat afloat,
we'll all go down together.

656
01:20:57,976 --> 01:21:01,434
- What the fuck are you?
- I'm a salvager.

657
01:21:01,613 --> 01:21:06,516
Just like you.
You collect ships, I collect souls.

658
01:21:06,685 --> 01:21:10,246
And when I fill my quota,
I send a boatload home.

659
01:21:10,456 --> 01:21:14,222
This will make management happy.
You see, it's a job.

660
01:21:14,426 --> 01:21:17,020
Given to me after a lifetime of sin.

661
01:21:17,196 --> 01:21:22,896
So if I lose this ship, management won't
be happy, which is not a good thing.

662
01:21:23,369 --> 01:21:27,430
I'm not getting through to you.
I'm asking for an exchange.

663
01:21:27,773 --> 01:21:30,071
This ship for your life.

664
01:21:30,242 --> 01:21:32,335
I want my crew back.

665
01:21:32,644 --> 01:21:36,580
Sorry. Once a passenger's marked,

All you had to do was fix the ship!

668

I gave you a great opportunity.

669
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:00,865
All you had to do was take it.

670
01:22:05,744 --> 01:22:08,542

671
01:25:32,417 --> 01:25:35,250

672
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:03,348
